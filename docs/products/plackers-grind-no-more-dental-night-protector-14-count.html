            <li>great product</li>
            <li>Its a great concept, but I think they need to either make some child size or not advertise the &amp;#34;one size...</li>

            <li>These work great</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>In my mouth, these work great.</li>
            <li>These are probably great if all you do is grind</li>

            <li>I normally am happy with all items purchased through Amazon</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>They have worked really great for me and have helped a lot.</li>
            <li>So happy I ordered them.</li>
            <li>Amazon was great about sending out a replacement order and THAT one showed up on time.</li>
            <li>Great for traveling, if you lose it..you have extras.</li>
            <li>When I wake up in the morning my teeth feel great</li>
            <li>This is really great product for dental guard.</li>
            <li>The guards also didn&#x27;t feel especially secure--</li>
            <li>Great Product.</li>
            <li>This may work great for others, however.  </li>
            <li>Works great, didn&#x27;t think they would even looking at them in my hand</li>
            <li>Product is Great.</li>
            <li>is a great solution.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THEM!!</li>
            <li>These are amazing!  </li>
            <li>What I am impressed with most is the fact that I can use them over and over.  </li>
            <li>I love this product because it fits my bite perfectly!</li>
            <li>two was better , day three was perfect</li>
            <li>I find it best to switch up from top to bottom from  time to time because it seems that I figure out ways in my sleep to clench or grind when I get used to it.  </li>
            <li>Good thing they were cheap!!!</li>
            <li>Just the fact that it was still in place in the morning was amazing, and I felt happy I&#x27;d done something to protect my teeth-</li>
            <li>Okay i liked the 600 dollar mouth guard best</li>
            <li>Not so good because if I sleep with this in my mouth, I&#x27;ll choke to death.  </li>
            <li>Maybe good for daytime if you have an injured lip or something like that.</li>
            <li>Does the job at a good price.  </li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>These work good.  </li>
            <li>(That&#x27;s what I do already, but it was good to know</li>
            <li>(That&#x27;s what I do already, but it was good to know it&#x27;s not harmful.)</li>
            <li>This is a good solution if you suspect you are grinding.</li>
            <li>It is a good product and I buy it often</li>
            <li>I thought these would be a good solution</li>
            <li>Works good...</li>
            <li>Fits good, not obtrusive like a sports mouth guard.</li>
            <li>but these work best and are cheap.  </li>
            <li>This is a good schedule for economy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a good product for the money.</li>
            <li>This is good</li>
            <li>As good as it gets for over the counter</li>
            <li>A good idea would be for Plackers to extend the plastic tabs (make them longer)</li>
            <li>A good idea would be for Plackers to extend the plastic tabs (make them longer)</li>
            <li>Reusable 3 times which is also good.</li>
            <li>Just a good as the night guards you have to mold.</li>
            <li>surprisingly they stay put.  </li>
            <li>Good Value.</li>
            <li>Definitely a good value.</li>
            <li>good quality</li>
            <li>If you looking for guard, it&#x27;s a good one to try.</li>
            <li>good guard and affortable</li>
            <li>This is a good buy, no uncomfortableness when I am sleeping.</li>
            <li>For the price it is good.</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>This is a good price too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to report that they have liked them as well.</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t let this review ruin all the good reviews this product has received.</li>
            <li>I used to have guards many years ago but always bit through them.&lt;br /&gt;After using these they aggravated my jaw so incredibly</li>
            <li>but if I find a good solution, I&#x27;ll update this review.</li>
            <li>This guard keeps my teeth apart, fits perfectly in my mouth,is comfortable, and the dog seems not to like it.</li>
            <li>These were good, but i had one made at the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>Good to use while driving.</li>
            <li>Best product available</li>
            <li>These seem to work just as good and they are disposable.</li>
            <li>These work surprisingly well, with no discomfort.</li>
            <li>I thought these were awesome because I slept better and felt like they allowed me to feel more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; while wearing them.</li>
            <li>I tried using it on the top and the bottom teeth, and top works best for me.  </li>
            <li>It was more cost effective and even better, it works great!!</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>It was all that said and much more , I am happy with my perchance and can sleep and get up with out pain</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>PS does not interfer with talking or drinking and most people do not know I am wearing the guard, which is great.</li>
            <li>These fit perfectly on either top or bottom.  </li>
            <li>I found for me the best fit is to put on top</li>
            <li>Best and most comfortable grind guards I can find.</li>
            <li>Plackers helping me not ruin any more fillings or chip teeth from grind/clenching when i sleep!</li>
            <li>I love these!  </li>
            <li>Fabulous for traveling!!</li>
            <li>And they&#x27;re sure cheaper than what the dentist recommends!</li>
            <li>I LOVE these!</li>
            <li>I LOVE these guards!</li>
            <li>I love these things!  </li>
            <li>You will be so pleased, and your dentist will thank you!</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love them!</li>
            <li>Dunno how safe or recommended that can be, but I do it anyways :P</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how I would feel about this, but they work so well!  </li>
            <li>I was unsure if these would work, but after one night of using this I felt much better!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe they don&#x27;t advertise this product more!  </li>
            <li>first night, it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>but this is much better than $600!</li>
            <li>After just one night of using these I love them!  </li>
            <li>Great for those of us who lose things easily.  </li>
            <li>Amazing how these work.  </li>
            <li>Now if these mouthguards would work on my mouthy cat, that would be amazing.</li>
            <li>These work and fit well and are a great deal.</li>
            <li>I never thought I&#x27;d be happy to sleep with a hunk of plastic in my mouth, but it&#x27;s a huge comfort to know I&#x27;m not wrecking my teeth, brushing doesn&#x27;t hurt now, and I don&#x27;t have a headache when I wake up.</li>
            <li>: The flexible fit of these is still great.</li>
            <li>Noticeably effective within one week.</li>
            <li>You can use them with the band around your bottom teeth or top teeth which is good to have that option (illustration on the package).</li>
            <li>Getting them through Amazon is the best bet as they are much cheaper here than in a drug store.  </li>
            <li>It was nice while it lasted.</li>
            <li>my son cant stand the guards that you have to warm &amp; then mold to your mouth....</li>
            <li>Kind of defeats the purpose I thought.</li>
            <li>The fact I can throw them away is good, more sanitary.</li>
            <li>According to the company&#x27;s own literature, they can be used for \\&quot;up to three nights\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this kind of mouth guard.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that it is disposable also.</li>
            <li>They did seem to stay in but seemed to add their own discomfort</li>
            <li>Wonderful - highly recommended!</li>
            <li>and they are still effective.</li>
            <li>I would not buy these again, instead I have purchased the Doctors night guard which you boil and in conforms to your own teeth.</li>
            <li>and then place it in my mouth and kind of suck it into place it stays in place longer.  </li>
            <li>Its a good guard that goes along with my retainer for my top and bottom.</li>
            <li>And to be honest, I think it is helping my bite.  </li>
            <li>Each mouthpiece is packaged in its own sealed container.  </li>
            <li>I grind my teeth a lot, so I always keep one handy in case</li>
            <li>I own a dental mouth guard.</li>
            <li>It fits in nice and it&#x27;s not invasive in my mouth.</li>
            <li>What is nice is you do not have to soak these or keep them in water.  </li>
            <li>How effective they are</li>
            <li>These nightime guards are superior to any form fitting teeth guard.</li>
            <li>Well made, excellent price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>So I really kind of bought this as an impulse buy.  </li>
            <li>To be totally honest, I had put it in my cart, lost interest and went on Facebook.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think that they will realty help me, but I bought they because of many good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They say these are 3-day guards, but honestly, I use them for longer than that.</li>
            <li>The Grind-No-More is a good fit for me and does the job!</li>
            <li>It is also reasonably priced, so perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li>They are kind of pricey for as often as you have to replace them.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!!!</li>
            <li>Your best off buying a higher end mouth guard or better yet a mouth piece made for you by your dentist.</li>
            <li>Clean and great for travel.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and i really really love it -- it is so easy to use in an effort to protect your teeth.</li>
            <li>great alternative to a full night guard.  </li>
            <li>These are great night guards for those of us that grind our teeth, but can&#x27;t stand a full size mouth guard.</li>
            <li>If they attached a bit more securely, they&#x27;d be great.  </li>
            <li>good price and easy to use</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying two more to make sure I have a good supply.</li>
            <li>Still kind of surprised, but these work great!!!</li>
            <li>Very easy to choke on if you are a mouth breather while sleeping.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it should be ok for most!</li>
            <li>These are perfect because they fit just right</li>
            <li>Bought these for my dear husband, so I can&#x27;t speak for him (although when I asked, he said they fit okay), but I am super happy with them because they stop him from grinding his teeth!</li>
            <li>Good fit for an over the counter mouth guard.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for grinding/clenching at night.</li>
            <li>So far, this is the best solution I have found.</li>
            <li>These are the best I&#x27;ve purchased thus far.</li>
            <li>I am happy to say that I will be able to wear these comfortably at night and will finally be able to save my teeth and</li>
            <li>It sure is nice not to have a pesky headache at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and the size is perfect for my mouth.</li>
            <li>I liked that it gave my mouth more space, but this made me worried that I would choke on it in the night.</li>
            <li>All in all a great, comfortable, easy to use (ie.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Suffice it to say that these work GREAT for preventing pain from bruxism (tooth grinding) &amp; I like these disposable ones a LOT better than the custom-moldable ones that, in my opinion, could never be adequately sterilized after weeks of continuous use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wear them on my lower set of teeth - very comfortable and unobtrusive, very easy to sleep in.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job of protecting teeth and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I have very strong gag reflexes so can&#x27;t wear most of the heavier thicker guards.</li>
            <li>I have been happily using them for years now at a much higher price.  </li>
            <li>When I first used this product, it worked great.</li>
            <li>The pain in my jaw was greatly reduced from the first night.</li>
            <li>price is great, much much cheaper than purchasing these at Walgreen!</li>
            <li>I might investigate other products along the way, but delighted to know this one works for me with great comfort and effectiveness!  </li>
            <li>and I expect that I will be pretty happy with these.  </li>
            <li>/grind my teeth a lot, and these are very comfortable.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great and more comfortable than most night guards, but the cheap rubber tends to cut along the roof of my mouth.</li>
            <li>very comfortable one.</li>
            <li>These guards work so well, and are very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable  to wear</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and does what it needs to do.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable.</li>
            <li>, these are very comfortable.</li>
            <li>My sleep is very important.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and in good condition.</li>
            <li>They work exactly as advertised and are saving my teeth very nicely.</li>
            <li>They are very comfortable, made from a very soft and pliable material and fit my mouth perfectly.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a light grinder or clencher you might get more out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!  </li>
            <li>I like that you can wear it on your top or bottom teeth and have found it to be very comfortable.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t like it, not stable, and I believe this causes me to grind more.</li>
            <li>These are so affordable and comfortable!</li>
            <li>I love these night guards.</li>
            <li>They mostly work for me.  </li>
            <li>and I dont grind my front teeth any more.  </li>
            <li>I have worn on both the top and bottom teeth.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I have dug through the trash looking for my $300 dentist guard.</li>
            <li>so it rests on top of most all of your teeth.</li>
            <li>I use them a lot longer than 3 days each more like 3 weeks each</li>
            <li>He has tried multiple mouth guards but he likes this one the best.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t love them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I am able to wear them for 6-10 days before I feel that they need to be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They are more for a child&#x27;s mouth.</li>
            <li>I am hoping that with these in my mouth at night I will sleep more relaxed and stop the grinding.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They are much more comfy because of their size and you can just throw them away....</li>
            <li>This is a FANTASTIC product!  </li>
            <li>and it is more bearable.</li>
            <li>My jaw seems more aligned now with this method I&#x27;m using, plus it is inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Sooo much better than paying $400+ for a dentist&#x27;s version that lasts a year.  </li>
            <li>Also like that I can use it either on top teeth or bottom teeth.</li>
            <li>All she could say was, &amp;#34;I&#x27;m glad you&#x27;re taking care of your teeth.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sleeping more restfully because I&#x27;m not grinding anymore.</li>
            <li>(Dentek and Sleeprights being the top 2).</li>
            <li>In my usage, I&#x27;ve been able to get close to a month use out of each one, so you can use that to factor cost.</li>
            <li>Much better than the one I bought for 300 dollars from he dentist.</li>
            <li>But it feels better than my $600 retainer fro the dentist that my dog chewed</li>
            <li>I care about my teeth, but I don&#x27;t want to spend more money than I need to.  </li>
            <li>I wear them on the top teeth.</li>
            <li>Top or bottom teeth</li>
            <li>(that&#x27;s why they get chewed through and you have to replace them), so if it slips out of place when that happens I&#x27;ll just end up grinding my teeth more.  </li>
            <li>He isn&#x27;t grinding his teeth any more and also has controlled the snoring issue.</li>
            <li>I am glad I tried them, even though I did end up ruling them out for myself.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic!</li>
            <li>It has holes on top for air circulation to finish drying out the device during the day.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TBHYBHG/ref&#x3D;ox_sc_act_title_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&amp;smid&#x3D;</li>
            <li>Turns out these things work better.</li>
            <li>Perhaps you will like them better.</li>
            <li>This one size fits most product doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>one guard lasts about three or four days probably more</li>
            <li>My dentist was pleased when I told her this was the product I was using.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love these.  </li>
            <li>I am so pleased that I did.  </li>
            <li>but as most things the wear out after a year or two.  </li>
            <li>Can wear on the top or bottom teeth.  </li>
            <li>Better off w/ the dentist taylored night guard.  </li>
            <li>Chewing on it caused more jaw pain.</li>
            <li>FYI, you can use these for more that 3 nights.  </li>
            <li>This is perfect and glad I got a big pack of these</li>
            <li>I am SO glad I found these!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love these mouthguards and have use them for years.</li>
            <li>What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>amazing, and cheap.</li>
            <li>The guards do protect my teeth, but also they entice me to gnaw and clench more than I do without them.</li>
            <li>There was no way I was going to be able to wear this all night long.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that they&#x27;re disposable.  </li>
            <li>love them.  </li>
            <li>I get a lot more than the instructed 3 days of usage.</li>
            <li>These have been my favorite mouth guards for years.  </li>
            <li>Am SO glad I did.</li>
            <li>I find they&#x27;re better placed on the lower teeth helping them to stay put</li>
            <li>Most I could tolerate but didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t love the idea of sleeping with plastic in my mouth,</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t know of any better options</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t love the idea of sleeping with plastic in my mouth,</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t know of any better options</li>
            <li>They do what they&#x27;re supposed to for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Bottom or top</li>
            <li>also advised the staff to let others know they can get a better price through Amazon</li>
            <li>My dentist probably feels better now too.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a more cost-effective alternative to a mouthguard than the bulky one I have had to get about once</li>
            <li>Love the ease of just popping it in, without having to boil to mold it.</li>
            <li>Glad to have found this product.</li>
            <li>can irritate my top lip on the inside).</li>
            <li>I would swallow it for sure.</li>
            <li>I ordered these and wore them at night and now my mouth has had a chance to heal and I&#x27;m not feeling any more pain from my root canal.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I tried for many, many nights to use this product, placing it on the bottom, on the top to no avail.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>Most wound up smelling bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like these so much more than the guard</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the mouths guards differ in that the sample was longer and had two plastic bubbles that would keep my top and bottom teeth from touching/grinding.</li>
            <li>This made me clinch more.</li>
            <li>When I used it on my top teeth it did prevent teeth grinding on eachother but not the tension in my jaw.</li>
            <li>I wear them for more days than it stated on the instructions with no problem.</li>
            <li>I love that they are portable and I keep one in my travel bag</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure to always have one with me.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li>Love them..would order from them again</li>
            <li>So glad I tried them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kinda glad its a use and dispose model</li>
            <li>The surface area the teeth grind over is one tooth on the top, and one tooth on the bottom (both sides, of course).</li>
            <li>For sure, you should also be followed by a dentist.</li>
            <li>No need to boil and try to shape them into fitting, no looking and sounding like a</li>
            <li>and I feel much better about putting them in my mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>basically ok, but</li>
            <li>Love these things.  </li>
            <li>I get a week or more on each one.  </li>
            <li>Tried them on the top &amp; bottom, couldn&#x27;t get them to stay in place.</li>
            <li>I love the minimalist design.</li>
            <li>Great quality, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel safe sleeping with them in for fear I&#x27;d be that one in a million that chokes on it when it undoubtedly fell out of place.</li>
            <li>BTW, a pack of 14 lasted me over a year as I reuse them until they feel worn-out.:)</li>
            <li>Only used these for 2 nights, but both me and my partner agree they&#x27;re the best over the counter guards</li>
            <li>Bonus, when I wake up my jaw is more relaxed.</li>
            <li>On the bottom and top teeth of course?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found them again.</li>
            <li>You can wear it on the bottom or top teeth,</li>
            <li>Love the product and will be a lifetime user.</li>
            <li>You can use them more than once, despite what packaging says.</li>
            <li>they lose their shape the more they are used, but I use each one about five times before tossing it.</li>
            <li>They are cheap but work!</li>
            <li>They want to make a custom fitting mouth guard</li>
            <li>I also use the grinders way more than 3 nights, I just basically use them until they&#x27;re so chewed up that they don&#x27;t give any protection anymore.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many mouth guards, I lost track.  </li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>Better than a $500 custom guard from the dentist.</li>
            <li>I have now set up regular delivery with these - they work perfectly!</li>
            <li>A wonderful product, I will definitely reorder when my 14 pack runs out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably move to a more permanent solution eventually.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I am a &amp;#34;grinder&amp;#34;; more specifically I have a front top and front bottom tooth</li>
            <li>after used it he said i&#x27;m getting MUCH better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure of it.  </li>
            <li>these magically showed up in the box.  </li>
            <li>No rhyme or reason as to why they would choose to stay put on EITHER the top or bottom.  </li>
            <li>but it is a much more affordable option for teeth grinding.</li>
            <li>Otherwise okay.</li>
            <li>It is not bulky like most of the night dental guards.</li>
            <li>-- I suspect that this product may work for folks who have more &amp;#34;average&amp;#34; mouths/teeth.</li>
            <li>Over the years I used so many of the moldable night guards that cover your front teeth that it pushed my front teeth out so that they the top teeth don&#x27;t touch my bottom teeth when I clench my teeth together.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found a substitute for my husband, so he won&#x27;t grind his teeth anymore at night.</li>
            <li>Not bulky at all, you can put it on the top or bottom teeth, I prefer the top.</li>
            <li>The clinching comes and goes for me mostly depending on my stress level</li>
            <li>Love them</li>
            <li>You can use them on top or bottom.</li>
            <li>You have to get used to them as the insert says which is ok.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>but if you clench you may want more cushion as I still wake up with a sore jaw.</li>
            <li>-- they&#x27;re more like a plastic pad over your front molars.  </li>
            <li>My teeth and mouth feel MUCH better.</li>
            <li>MY BOYFRIEND HAS BEEN ABLE TO SLEEP BETTER WITHOUT THE EFFECT OF THE GRINDING.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>You can wear them on top or the bottom</li>
            <li>but they felt better to me on the top.  </li>
            <li>Love love love these mouth</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>They do fit rather nicely.  </li>
            <li>I still wake up many times during the night and catch myself trying to grind.  </li>
            <li>I have already broke 2 teeth because of grinding and will admit it does keep my teeth from actually touching others.  </li>
            <li>feels OK to me.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s an excellent product for grinders, but definitely is not made for clenchers and ended up making my problem worse--not better.</li>
            <li>Product is OK but just does not work for me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll order or buy more.</li>
            <li>Love they help with jaw fatigue.</li>
            <li>I sleep so much better now.</li>
            <li>no scraping, pinching, spit buildup-no anything just a nice piece that fit over my molars to protect against the nightly grind.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You can even wear them during the day (you can even talk while wearing it!)&lt;br /&gt;4-Can be worn on top or bottom teeth</li>
            <li>This gives more protectors, which has softer material for you to chew on.  </li>
            <li>So I guess only non-grinders with perfect teeth should use these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to give it a couple more nights and hope that it gets better.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is discrete and does not cover the front of your teeth.</li>
            <li>but I would expect better support.</li>
            <li>I do not use it every night; mostly when I am feeling a bit stressed or some times if I wake up and find that I have been clenching.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>Can be worn on top or bottom teeth.</li>
            <li>was ok</li>
            <li>and I find myself with More TMJ</li>
            <li>I place it on the top, move it to the right spot and it is good to go.  </li>
            <li>Great product and decent price.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very comfortable and easy to get used to.</li>
            <li>Very light and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>They are pretty good, it does what its supposed to.</li>
            <li>I bought these because of the reviews - they seemed pretty good.</li>
            <li>Stays pretty good in place, but after the fifth use, it tends to deform.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t inspire much confidence to look at out-of-the-box, however, remarkably they do work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not hard on my teeth because the placker was still in great shape every morning.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I found them on Amazon for the price that I used to always pay!</li>
            <li>These are great for 2-4 uses to use while I save up for a new mouth guard.  </li>
            <li>I wear them on the top and bottom depending on what I feel is most comfortable on the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but it is a good fit for us right now</li>
            <li>I order these monthly they are very comfortable for me, light and portable  stays in my mouth  until I remove</li>
            <li>I have used one more than 3 days out of necessity and it worked fine.</li>
            <li>We get about a weeks worth out of one guard and the best part is they fit our young daughter</li>
            <li>From the get-go, I already discovered it wasn&#x27;t going to fit my top teeth, so I went with the bottom.</li>
            <li>I ended up getting a custom made night guard at the dentist and have been happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>These, however, fit pretty good.</li>
            <li>SO much more comfortable than my $500 dentist-made guard.</li>
            <li>Also box claims to fit any mouth, top teeth or bottom, but it feels flimsy and impractical to keep in your mouth.</li>
            <li>Most comfortable mouth guard I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li>They fit comfortably (top or bottom teeth, your choice)</li>
            <li>The fit of these mouth guards does take some getting use to, but they have helped a lot and my neck feels better every morning.</li>
            <li>Much more comfortable than a mouthguard.  </li>
            <li>These guards are comfortable and I&#x27;m able to use them 4 or 5 nights before disposing.&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li>Well because at first it felt good and comfortable in my mouth.</li>
            <li>As a retired dental hygienist, I can say these are a great alternative to a professional mouth guard if you just don&#x27;t have the funds to get one made through your dentist.  </li>
            <li>whichever you feel most comfortable.</li>
            <li>Seem to fit better if you put it on the bottom teeth.</li>
            <li>These are great for my husband, who is a LOUD grinder.</li>
            <li>Best money spent on a night guard.</li>
            <li>Way more comfortable than the one the dentist had made for 400.00.  </li>
            <li>They get the job done well but aren&#x27;t the most comfortable thing.</li>
            <li>Thanks for good product.</li>
            <li>As another reviewer observed, it&#x27;s easy to clean and seems just a durable as any comparable solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bravo!</li>
            <li>they work great except for one major flaw: you gotta remember to put it in!  </li>
            <li>guards arrived VERY quickly (2-3 days).  </li>
            <li>These are easy and convenient.</li>
            <li>They are even easy to wear and also have a conversation.  </li>
            <li>I can easily wear these all night without any problems.  </li>
            <li>If this fits your mouth, I think you&#x27;re in luck and would easily make this a 4.5 star item - otherwise keep on looking.</li>
            <li>That makes it easy to pack in my suitcase.</li>
            <li>Easy to wash, too --</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re easy to bring when</li>
            <li>I have found it most useful when I place it on my bottom teeth instead of the top.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Needless to say, I have moved on and am now using DenTek Comfort Fit NightGuard (which are \\&quot;squishy\\&quot; and adjustable along with being comfortable worn either on the top teeth or bottom)</li>
            <li>and you can easily to choke with them when you can&#x27;t control yourself.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>I thought this could be easily inserted at night as a &amp;#34;buffer&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For me, it became dislodged too easily and I felt like I could choke on it.</li>
            <li>They say disposable after 1 night, but if you rinse it with water and/or mouthwash and store it in a clean place it lasts up to 3 days, or more if you don&#x27;t use every night.</li>
            <li>easy to sleep with it in.</li>
            <li>I can use one for a couple of weeks easily, I just rinse them off in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Easily accommodates changes in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>Easy to wear no discomfort</li>
            <li>They are so easy to wear.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They&#x27;re easy to pop in</li>
            <li>This is cheaper than Target, easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The concept is good, similar to the Dentek ones except no adjustable strap to worry about not holding into place - nice slim profile.</li>
            <li>taste any strong plastic odor/taste like I read</li>
            <li>I have a strong gag reflex and they have not made me gag.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very comfortable and super easy to use.</li>
            <li>Perfect for me, easy to fit, not bulky like the other&#x27;s</li>
            <li>These fit a whole lot better than the boil kind.</li>
            <li>I find that if I warm it under a hot tap  </li>
            <li>I love these mouth guards, they are perfect for someon like me, with a small mouth.  </li>
            <li>These are fine disposable mouth guards.</li>
            <li>The device is comfortable, easy to insert and remove.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d say if you need something in a pinch they&#x27;re fine</li>
            <li>but I did fine.</li>
            <li>and I was fine.</li>
            <li>It works fine.</li>
            <li>and I find these totally fine.</li>
            <li>What lawyer doesn&#x27;t spend his/her nights clenching their jaw and grinding their teeth into a fine powder?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works fine but does fall out at night.</li>
            <li>Really easy to wear, and a fantastic value.</li>
            <li>just pop in and no boiling for fit so easy  and just brush appliance</li>
            <li>Easy to use, comfortable.  </li>
            <li>and I slept fine without it getting in the way or falling out.</li>
            <li>Comfortable, easy fit</li>
            <li>(about a month, with my usage)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to keep clean, and can easily be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They work fine, and are relatively comfortable.</li>
            <li>but they last more then 3 days each, good buy and easy to take on the road with you</li>
            <li>and it has made a huge difference in how my teeth and jaw feels in he morning.</li>
            <li>but I have because my doctor recommended them and it Made a huge difference</li>
            <li>They are light and comfortable and assuredly BPA free.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t want to shell out another huge amount, so I thought I would give these a try.  </li>
            <li>There was no need to go to the dentist/orthodontist to get fitted for a huge mouth guard.</li>
            <li>I had a huge headache for almost 2 days</li>
            <li>If you are thinking of trying these, my recommendation is to order their free sample here before buying:</li>
            <li>They fit me well</li>
            <li>i think they&#x27;d fit anyone.</li>
            <li>I ordered this to &amp;#34;try out the idea&amp;#34; of sleeping in a mouth guard to see if it was comfortable-</li>
            <li>They fit into your mouth with no problem and they can be worn in one of two ways.  </li>
            <li>These are comfortable and they work.</li>
            <li>They are also comfortable.</li>
            <li>I am a light sleeper, the slightest discomfort would wake me.</li>
            <li>These are comfortable and stay in all night, no problem.</li>
            <li>feels great, but stops 3/4 of the way to the back on my mouth</li>
            <li>that you either have to mold to fit your teeth or just have to deal with a mouthful of rubber and plastic parts.</li>
            <li>These plackers are  comfortable and cost is an issue.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get that part to be comfortable at all.  </li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t fit well over the front curve of your teeth.  </li>
            <li>comfortable fit and does what it is supposed to do</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find them terribly comfortable.</li>
            <li>but I found they didn&#x27;t really fit correctly.  </li>
            <li>They have saved me a lot of money, they are comfortable, and I bless the day I found  them here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re comfortable to wear, and they do not fall out.</li>
            <li>This does not feel secure in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I paid $300 for a dentist-provided custom night guard, but when I had to get a crown, it no longer fit.  </li>
            <li>I thought this product would fit comfortably.</li>
            <li>I have used and the price is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I stretch them to fit comfortably in my mouth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Plackers give protection, no soreness, doesn&#x27;t move around alot (it does move some but is not disruptive) and is unbelievably comfortable.  </li>
            <li>If anyone is in the downtown Houston area and wanting to try before buy, I have about 8 left LOL.</li>
            <li>If anyone is in the downtown Houston area and wanting to try before buy, I have about 8 left LOL.</li>
            <li>This guard is convenient because it&#x27;s disposable and it is comfortable.</li>
            <li>These stay in place just as well as the custom fit ones without all the bulk.  </li>
            <li>As others have stated these don&#x27;t fit well.</li>
            <li>Not grinding, per se, but rather a CHOMP CHOMP CHOMP sound.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable and protective.</li>
            <li>Then I tried the ones you fit yourself in boiling water, those lasted a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li>They are comfortable and well packaged.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit, doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are not as comfortable as the night guard I had</li>
            <li>DoctorS Nightguard Advanced Comfort Box]]</li>
            <li>I find that this kind of \\&quot;stretch\\&quot; relaxes my jaw, and makes me not clench as much.</li>
            <li>I find that this kind of \\&quot;stretch\\&quot; relaxes my jaw, and makes me not clench as much.</li>
            <li>I suspect, too, but it&#x27;s never been confirmed.</li>
            <li>They are comfortable.</li>
            <li>These fit snugly in my mouth and prevent me from grinding my teeth together at night.  </li>
            <li>As a person who has a great deal of dental work, the regular \\&quot;boil and mold\\&quot; night guards are out of the question.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the fit, and they are cheap enough I do not get upset when the dog gets ahold of one and chews it up.</li>
            <li>They work, keeping my teeth from grinding together, but they&#x27;re not as comfortable as fitted guards because they tend to move around within my mouth a lot.</li>
            <li>guard takes a couple of nights to get used to and is secure and relatively comfortable.  </li>
            <li>visited plackers.com and noticed an offer for a \\&quot;free sample\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I have only used the guards for two nights and I am happy to report NO headaches and No tooth aches.  </li>
            <li>They fit well and don&#x27;t hinder my sleep.</li>
            <li>They are comfortable, and I haven&#x27;t choked on them or died, so that&#x27;s a plus.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know who would feel comfortable wearing this all night.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll continue with the Plackers Grind-no-MOre for the foreseeable and grateful to have found something that&#x27;s comfortable and works.</li>
            <li>The price is cheap also.</li>
            <li>This has been great, keeps my back teeth apart, I believe.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and they are custom fit.</li>
            <li>Versatile fit and not bulky in the mouth.</li>
            <li>It is so comfortable to wear and does not hurt my mouth.</li>
            <li>They are comfortable but I perfer the lower jaw fit.</li>
            <li>And even with that, the design of these don&#x27;t make for them to fit conveniently.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really fit my mouth</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit my mouth and fell out during sleep.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t fit</li>
            <li>In the mouth, it didn&#x27;t fit quite well and it was floating around</li>
            <li>They are comfortable and don&#x27;t affect your speech.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re comfortable and disposable.</li>
            <li>Great guards for daily use</li>
            <li>Great product and only one</li>
            <li>This device is comfortable and seems to have solved my clenching problem.</li>
            <li>Hubby says they are as comfortable to him as the others...</li>
            <li>Weren&#x27;t comfortable.  </li>
            <li>The Doctor&#x27;s NightGuard Advanced Comfort Dental Protector for Teeth Grinding, 1 pack]].</li>
            <li>Some of them are not even &amp;#34;squared&amp;#34; to fit in your mouth… unless my jaw has become &amp;#34;un-squared&amp;#34; which I guess is a possibility.  </li>
            <li>Fit comfortably in the mouth.  </li>
            <li>My dentist told me there was evidence I was grinding my teeth and offered to sell me a custom fit guard.</li>
            <li>boiling (unlike the $30 mouthpieces that you wind up throwing away because they don&#x27;t fit</li>
            <li>Light and comfortable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this item feels comfortable</li>
            <li>They are easy to clean (rinse in water or soak in mouth wash).  </li>
            <li>I can sleep comfortably with one in.</li>
            <li>they are comfortable and don&#x27;t interfere with my oxygen at all.</li>
            <li>Light weight and who cares if you lose it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>isn&#x27;t really a cheap option if used as directed - 1 mouth guard every 3 days.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To enjoy it even more, I spread tasty Fun Dip powder on the mouth guard before bed each night.  </li>
            <li>I bought these for my 13 yr old son and they work good to prevent his grinding.  </li>
            <li>I was self conscious with this thing in my mouth and didn&#x27;t get a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li>They last for more than 3 days which makes them a good deal.  </li>
            <li>the Good thing about these is that you can wear them during the day (say while driving) and speak  clearly and even sip coffee</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised at how good they work.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fit right and the material makes me want to chew more.</li>
            <li>but it will cost many hundreds of dollars which we just don&#x27;t have right now and is not covered by insurance.</li>
            <li>i was all happy and excited to finally have found a solution to my grinding.</li>
            <li>Certainly much cheaper than having the dentist composing an appliance for your teeth!!!</li>
            <li>Very useful considering the cost and what would have cost if one is to go through the hassle of claiming one through insurance.</li>
            <li>These are comfortable and do the job adequately and if the dog gets it, it&#x27;s easily replaced with another without hurting your pocketbook.  </li>
            <li>I wear them under my top teeth for a more comfortable fit, but they are just the most amazing little things.</li>
            <li>I have an average/ small mouth and it fit me perfect.</li>
            <li>My mouth is quite small and these fit the best and</li>
            <li>In fairness to the SleepRight guard, which is my second favorite, the SleepRight does feel more \\&quot;secure\\&quot; and more cushioned, if that is important to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quick and easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t sure this would work since i typically wear the acrylic one from my dentist, but it&#x27;s great for weekend trips.</li>
            <li>I found them at our local drug store and tried them and they are amazing!</li>
            <li>Best part is because they are so small, they won&#x27;t ruin your sex life.</li>
            <li>I wore one for the first time last night and was sort of impressed at first...</li>
            <li>Once you try them and want more, look into the auto delivery program through Amazon and cross one more thing off your list of things to worry about!  </li>
            <li>I am glad so many others have found these night guards useful, but for me, not so much.</li>
            <li>I love that my husband doesn&#x27;t have some gross discolored mouth guard sitting by the sink all the time any more!</li>
            <li>Worth the money, without a doubt!</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s slim, I do not experience any significant change in my bite pattern either, which can be a problem with over the counter mouth guards.</li>
            <li>Those guys are extremely familiar with any TMJ disorder.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can use it more than the three recommended times, which manufacturer says just to make you keep buying more, but it actually can be used more times, if you care to keep it antiseptically stored.</li>
            <li>When I originally found these at the dollar store I had to try.</li>
            <li>I was in love the first night.</li>
            <li>Those moldable mouth guards, sure, you can get them hot</li>
            <li>I can feel how they could alter your bite if you used them long term, but for me these are a great solution.</li>
            <li>I love waking up without headaches and they&#x27;re pretty inexpensive for walking up</li>
            <li>Grind no more is the best ones I have ever found.</li>
            <li>After using Plackers Mouth Guard for several months, I have to say it&#x27;s the best in the market as far as I know!</li>
            <li>The guard fits pretty well and doesn&#x27;t slip, over all I&#x27;d say that I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li>These are much more comfortable than the large over the counter ones that are dropped&lt;br /&gt;in boiling water</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that you can have a new pair when needed.</li>
            <li>Very cheap in large quantities.</li>
            <li>I like these because I don&#x27;t have to continuously clean the mouthguard.</li>
            <li>These are much easier and more comfortable to wear at night.  </li>
            <li>Plackers are super sleek and light.</li>
            <li>Compared to the self molded athletic style guards, there are no irregular bite marks to clean.</li>
            <li>The Plackers guard is also easier to clean than the SleepRight guard.</li>
            <li>Ironically, the Plackers \\&quot;disposable\\&quot; guards are the easiest to clean and keep using!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I change out just to be clean.</li>
            <li>I clean it every morning</li>
            <li>Kind of magical actually.  </li>
            <li>Clean when you wake up</li>
            <li>a dentist &amp; PLACKERS is even better than several custom guards I own.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good product, much smaller and more confortable than the boil and mold type of mouth guard.</li>
            <li>These are OK for the first night, but they quickly wear out.</li>
            <li>We have 3 dogs, who love to find them, so he goes through them pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>They are comfortable, Not bulky like professional dentist, I can get a new clean one every couple of days, great for travel...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed they are very particular about not using it for more than 3 days as I assume it starts disintegrating at a non-visible level.</li>
            <li>(My Dad got one specially made, and he can&#x27;t close his mouth all the way when he wears it.</li>
            <li>works as expected great price.</li>
            <li>They really work as well, maybe better than, my $600 mouthguard from the dentist (which broke).</li>
            <li>Product is good but definitely consult doctor before use.</li>
            <li>This seems like a good idea because it creates a gap between all of your teeth without needing to actually cover them all, but that isn&#x27;t the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought these looked like a good option because they didn&#x27;t have to be molded to your mouth, but the only thing holding them in place is me gritting my teeth.  </li>
            <li>This is good for people who grind occasionally when stressed (like me).</li>
            <li>For me these would be a good back up</li>
            <li>These things last me a good month for each Mouth Peice.</li>
            <li>- I realized that this is from this thing and trying to find the sweet spot that it would sit well</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who appreciates top quality at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>While it isn&#x27;t totally comfortable, it is far more comfortable than others I have tried.</li>
            <li>I thought these were full mouth piece.</li>
            <li>and they fit fun.  </li>
            <li>I have tried the full mouth ones and could not keep them in my mouth.</li>
            <li>We haven&#x27;t been able to find these reasonably priced mouth guards.  </li>
            <li>You would be better off getting a real mouth guard.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing against the seller...</li>
            <li>Those work very well for a month or 2 and cost a LOT more.</li>
            <li>You can wear them above your top (I prefer) or bottom teeth as is more comfortable.</li>
            <li>My dentist thought they were so cool.</li>
            <li>I think this length is more ideal than reaching all the way to the back, just personal preference and how my teeth are lined up.</li>
            <li>I love that they don&#x27;t take up your whole mouth.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit right.  </li>
            <li>I have used a variety of mouth guards to fight my bruxism, I like this one the best because it fits only on the back teeth, rinses clean, and this supply lasts me forever.</li>
            <li>may not fit perfectly, but I did find that I developed this habit of kind of \\&quot;sucking\\&quot; it into place, and now the size doesn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
            <li>After buying large, bulky mouth guards for a few years, these are a welcome change!  </li>
            <li>After reading so many positive reviews on here about these night protectors, I was pretty excited to try them out.  </li>
            <li>I have not used any other brand of night guards, but I haven&#x27;t had to because these are great.  </li>
            <li>The idea of the Plackers Mouth Guard Is a good one, a small, unobtrusive, disposable guard that can universally fit anyone with none of the boiling, cleaning and fitting.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use them for my everynight guard, but they&#x27;re great to have on hand for the times I forget to pack my other.</li>
            <li>These on the other hand are great</li>
            <li>This product was great for me while I decided what other semi-permanent solution I should use.</li>
            <li>These are perfect - very small &amp; non-intrusive.  </li>
            <li>The material is nice and squishy, which provides a good cushion instead of the really hard dentist made night protector.</li>
            <li>so it covers most all the top of my teeth, so they are lasting longer</li>
            <li>Jaw clicking and mild pain.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to have to get something more solid with more coverage.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re far more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Plus the insides of my cheeks got quickly torn up.</li>
            <li>I was quick to buy these thinking</li>
            <li>but I think it is the best value for those of us who may forget or lose more expensive products.</li>
            <li>Every morning I brush it well and give it a quick splash of my mouthwash.</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>They are super flimsy.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this, I won&#x27;t be trying any others out. :)</li>
            <li>I have been using these for several years and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>I started grinding my teeth at night and tried a cheap solution first.  </li>
            <li>Bottom is a bit more comfortable but they still do not stay in my mouth at night or feel like they fit properly.  </li>
            <li>I used the other highly-rated dental guards on Amazon (sleepright etc.) but switched to this because of good ratings and cheap cost.</li>
            <li>I rinse them in very hot water each morning.  </li>
            <li>and I had no fear of accidentally swallowing one; they fit securely and definitely provide a sufficient cushioning pad between top &amp; bottom molars.  </li>
            <li>Based on other reviews, I decided to give this one a try, and it is by far is the BEST I have come across.</li>
            <li>Just like a Pro unit, you will salivate more than normal, however that will subside.  </li>
            <li>It was my first time that I used guard , I feel comfortable at all.</li>
            <li>Being that they&#x27;re pretty cheap and disposable</li>
            <li>Am very glad I read others reviews and ultimately purchased these for myself.</li>
            <li>As others have noted, these are comfortable, affordable, sanitary, and absolutely do the job!  </li>
            <li>I only use these when I am stressed and can feel that I will have a grind my teeth kind of night and that is why I choose disposable because then I don&#x27;t have to store and clean anything.  </li>
            <li>I have found that if you clean and dry them each morning they are good for far more than 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can see why though since the new guards are much more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m OK with these until I can afford a new molded night&lt;br /&gt;guard.</li>
            <li>These were great, first off my teeth are not straight</li>
            <li>Put it on my bottom teeth first, but that hurt my gum in front too much, so I switched to the top.  </li>
            <li>These mouth guards are very descrete and easy to wear.</li>
            <li>These are very convenient and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>(I just replaced my first one after a month!</li>
            <li>I love how small they are and if it gets flung across the room and lost it is ok since there are so many in a pkg.</li>
            <li>A special thanks to mans best friend for finally eating my regular mouth guard.  </li>
            <li>It took a little while to get used to, but they work great for me.</li>
            <li>These guards are comfortable and protect all my teeth very well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to toss one out and have a fresh way every few weeks.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product and they&#x27;re very affordable.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re comfortable, inexpensive, very unobtrusive and lightweight.  </li>
            <li>Further, the place where the plastic rests between the teeth is halfway to the rear of the mouth which has proven, for me anyway, to be much more comfortable than the Sleepright.</li>
            <li>They are more comfortable than some mouth guards -- and smaller -- but they still bugged me.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a professional mouth guard and have been using these for a while now and love them.</li>
            <li>and these are by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>obviously because crowns yield a tidy profit).  </li>
            <li>Use them 3-4 nights then get a fresh one.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that I can get a fresh mouth guard every week.</li>
            <li>they are ok, they didn&#x27;t fit my mouth well enough to survive the night without falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li>When they do last though they might last for four days and are wonderful and bring much needed relief and help me avoid morning headaches that comes from teeth grinding.</li>
            <li>If you do suffer from clinching or grinding they are worth a try.</li>
            <li>It can be placed on either upper or lower teeth, whichever is more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s 1.20 or per piece, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>wait to do this - it is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>but this is rare.</li>
            <li>A custom fitted mouth piece is worth the peace of mind.</li>
            <li>Because it is made of soft rubber I have found myself tending to chew it more than what I do with the rigid protector I got from my dentist.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a heavy grinder, so I&#x27;m sure that aids in the extend use.</li>
            <li>He like them even better than his professional one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had top soft plastic pieces.  </li>
            <li>Then, when I blew about a $100 on South Park DVD&#x27;s (well worth every penny)</li>
            <li>The design is very simple but also effective.</li>
            <li>However, they recommend you use these only once and then discard, which is kind of overkill.  </li>
            <li>Since these are MUCH MUCH more comfortable I actually use them.</li>
            <li>These are an economical way to keep a &#x27;fresh&#x27; mouthguard on hand all the time.</li>
            <li>It spreads your upper and lower jaw by a minute amount, effectively preventing contact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tried a couple others purchased through drug store, the type you soaked in warm water and molded to your upper teeth.  </li>
            <li>Open the individual packs, tested it under my top teeth, flipped it over onto my bottom teeth because it was more comfortable and voila!</li>
            <li>For the price you pay, I guess plackers are worth it.</li>
            <li>You get your money&#x27;s worth with the plackers mouth guard.</li>
            <li>No such issues here - they&#x27;re inexpensive and quite effective.</li>
            <li>You can talk and smile and it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;Great for travel.</li>
            <li>Better priced as other mouth guards, with better protection, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>these made me grind more, not less.  </li>
            <li>As long as I leave it loose, it works great!</li>
            <li>Definitely can use each for many nights; just a matter of keeping it clean and not losing it.</li>
            <li>I was a little apprehensive at first, but I&#x27;ve been using these for a couple months now and they are great.  </li>
            <li>No longer available at the dollar store, so I went to Amazon, and glad to find a bigger box of the exact product.</li>
            <li>I bit right thru these.</li>
            <li>Sleep Right</li>
            <li>The mouth guard does not stay in the right spot.</li>
            <li>I could tell right away that it wouldn&#x27;t stay in my mouth at night.</li>
            <li>right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and right.  </li>
            <li>right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and right.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I used it for the right reasons, but</li>
            <li>You stop clenching your teeth together) the darn thing falls out into your throat or right out of your mouth.</li>
            <li>For me, they work just right.</li>
            <li>did right chioce.</li>
            <li>Granted, with my breath right strip and the teeth protector</li>
            <li>Easy to take on travel or vacation, just throw them out, use a new one.</li>
            <li>My husband (normal-sized mouth kind of guy) tried it and had exactly the same issues.</li>
            <li>These are thin, flexible, and can be worn on top or bottom - which is so nice!  </li>
            <li>Plus I&#x27;m still not entirely sure what kind of bacteria will accumulate with using it more than 3 nights in a row.</li>
            <li>It would explain tired/aching jaws and headaches in the morning, but insurance wouldn&#x27;t cover it and I wasn&#x27;t willing to spend the full amount without trying some over the counter solutions first.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re ok, but I seem to chomp down more often when I use them during the day.  </li>
            <li>Also, the coverage isn&#x27;t great -- these won&#x27;t help so much if you primarily grind your front teeth, since they only cover your back molars.</li>
            <li>It really does help with grinding, though each one isn&#x27;t good for very long.</li>
            <li>These mouth guards do okay, but the Dental Guard I previously bought was better.</li>
            <li>I seriously never expected to find so many benefits in a mouthguard, these are a lifesaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is great because it is small.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d say these are not only more comfortable they are much cheaper.</li>
            <li>but they are small and great for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think that will depend on what kind of grinding issue you have, whether you&#x27;re biting or basically eating the thing all night long.</li>
            <li>no bad cheaper than the real deal ..</li>
            <li>The thing I really love about these mouthguards is that they are disposable and therefore I am able to have a new mouthguard much more often then the more expensive longer-lasting mouthguards.</li>
            <li>Granted, he&#x27;s the only man-study in my lab right now, but I am so happy I get to sleep through the night uninterrupted again!!  </li>
            <li>I feel if it was a little more form fitting it would work.  </li>
            <li>So far so good, I&#x27;m like them, no more grinding easy to clean</li>
            <li>I got these because my dentist made night guard doesn&#x27;t fit anymore because of a new crown.</li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t use them after the first night and returned them right away.</li>
            <li>These are lightweight and so much more comfortable and easy to clean than the heavy old plastic guards made by dentists</li>
            <li>No More guards are sturdy, but not uncomfortable and provide great support for grinders like me.</li>
            <li>These are super helpful and very convenient.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few different types, but these work the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since found others with a similarly flexible fit that are BPA free</li>
            <li>I tried a few different grind guards and this was the best.</li>
            <li>They are so small and still very effective.</li>
            <li>Most of the reviews were great, especially for people with a small mouths, except 1 person.</li>
            <li>They fit more comfortably and I can usually use one for 3 days.</li>
            <li>The guard works for mild teeth grinding an does not irritate the soft tissues of the mouth the way a full mouth guard can.</li>
            <li>But the plastic distorts very fast..</li>
            <li>I found these years ago at CVS for a very reasonable price</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are super soft, clean up with a simple rinse and are usable for a week or more</li>
            <li>Very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>If you wonder whether a bite guard will help you, this is a very reasonable priced item and makes either a low-cost experiment or for permanent use.</li>
            <li>This one is very comfortable and not too big for my mouth.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive, VERY comfortable, actually works, AND</li>
            <li>Tldr; This brand does not provide very much protection for us chronic grinders</li>
            <li>These grind no more dental night protectors work better, are more convenient to use, and are more economical than the custom protectors that my dentist fabricated.</li>
            <li>They are much more comfortable than other mouth guards I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I use them far longer than the package says, and they hold up fine.  </li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t the most comfortable things in the world but they don&#x27;t cut my mouth from being too sharp and it&#x27;s bearable enough for me to be able to sleep.</li>
            <li>after one night of use, i woke up without a headache for the first time in months.  </li>
            <li>and I think that is what causes most of the problems with regular mouth guards.</li>
            <li>These hold up pretty well on night gnashing.</li>
            <li>These are great and very inexpensive compared to similar guards you can buy in bigger stores.</li>
            <li>[...] It definitely seems like a hit-or-miss sort of thing, like with many \\&quot;one size fits all\\&quot; products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the mouthpiece-like night guard, and the more expensive lasts-for-months version of this night guard (the one with the adjustable size), and have come back to these Plackers as being the best of the lot.  </li>
            <li>but my first night i slept so well!&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are soft from the package and you don&#x27;t need to boil them to fit in your mouth.</li>
            <li>Too much STRESS!  </li>
            <li>I use them with the top on the upper row of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>A night guard that covers all of the upper or lower teeth is a much better investment than this product.  </li>
            <li>Most likely won&#x27;t buy again, unless my son decides he likes them.</li>
            <li>I tried both top and bottom teeth and the same thing happened: the guard moved and slid all over the place.</li>
            <li>We both tried to wear it on the top and bottom teeth with the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Multiple attempts to get a better placement were fruitless.  </li>
            <li>This is my first teeth guard</li>
            <li>I think, which was why I got them in the first place.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that they are I individually packaged.</li>
            <li>They are also pretty darn sturdy.</li>
            <li>The price is pretty close to what I have seen elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it&#x27;s not one size fits all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, it is the most simple.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the first guard for two weeks now</li>
            <li>A much needed, well-designed product!</li>
            <li>years ago a program on Netflix was a documentary of travel in places where most of the population has never seen a person from civilization.</li>
            <li>This item is exactly what my  husband needed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m most pleased at how small this guard fits in my mouth.</li>
            <li>These work very well!</li>
            <li>No More guards are awesome because they are sort of like daily contacts.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed is that I stopped having headaches.</li>
            <li>to durability I am still using the first one I tried.</li>
            <li>I first used them I would have dreams I was eating things which when I&#x27;d wake up I&#x27;d realize was me chewing on the guard.  </li>
            <li>I would say that my jaw pain has been so reduced  that I am rarely aware of the discomfort that I had before I began using this product.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t wearing it at first.</li>
            <li>I felt like my bite was off when I would first wake up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been rinsing it every morning, airing it out on my nightstand, and make sure my teeth are brushed before I go to bed.</li>
            <li>I love how you can switch it from the upper to the lower teeth, too.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite guards and when I could no longer find them at my local drug store, I searched here.</li>
            <li>Ok, having suffered from bruxism (teeth grinding) nightly, for several years, was told to get something to wear at night by my dentist.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not bulky either, so you&#x27;re more likely to wear it at night.</li>
            <li>Will definitely continue to use them and they are more affordable than the almost $700 for a custom fitted one from the dentist.</li>
            <li>but I use &#x27;em for a month to 6 weeks with no ill effects.  </li>
            <li>You get a sore throat from breathing with your mouth open all nite long...found better mouthguard than these on line</li>
            <li>I quickly go back to not clenching and this process seems to irritate my jaw more by the time I wake up.  </li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li>and they work pretty well.</li>
            <li>14 was more than enough.  </li>
            <li>I decided to be a big girl and try it again, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>And it definitely covers a lot more tooth than the super-expensive \\&quot;professional\\&quot; ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it definitely covers a lot more tooth than the super-expensive \\&quot;professional\\&quot; ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only that but setting up a subscription with them, I don&#x27;t have to worry about not being able to find them when I run out.</li>
            <li>These are a TERRIFIC, more hygienic alternative to custom-molded mouthpieces for overnight use for defeating bruxism.  </li>
            <li>I ,do it consistently.</li>
            <li>My first pack lasted me a year.</li>
            <li>These seem like the best deal to me, as I only use a guard occasionally and they can be used multiple times each.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely order more.</li>
            <li>I tried a bulkier mouth guard first</li>
            <li>After I tried them out for the first time, I knew I would buy them again.  </li>
            <li>To me, this is much more hygienic than using the same mouth guard for months at a time.  </li>
            <li>The material is comfortable and soft.  </li>
            <li>This is my first mouth guard</li>
            <li>Does seem to put more pressure in a smaller area though.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I did try the full mouth guard type and just couldn&#x27;t get it to fit properly.</li>
            <li>This product helped me so much!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using my first one and it has been a month.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!  </li>
            <li>Personally, I would look into a more durable product.</li>
            <li>Wearing this actually made me clinch more which inflamed my jaw muscles.</li>
            <li>I have used mouth guards for years but recently lost two to my favorite dog.  </li>
            <li>and I did not think these very slim mouth guards would work, but they did!</li>
            <li>first glance, these look like you would choke on them and die.  </li>
            <li>I then put it on the upper teeth and it felt okay.  </li>
            <li>My first mouth guard is going on 2 months with no signs of wear or discoloration.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It works, but,.....not a natural fit on the front teeth and gums....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried more expensive ones and different types and decided on these as the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid big money for custom mouth guards and none of them proved to be better than these.</li>
            <li>First of all, a mouth guard isn&#x27;t going to get you to stop grinding.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t give the same protection level, but some is better than none</li>
            <li>I actually like these bite guards better.</li>
            <li>This is the first night guard I&#x27;ve used that worked for me.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;d more likely fall out if it became that dislodged.  </li>
            <li>so if it does happen you most likely will wake up and put it</li>
            <li>I also have a small mouth, so those &amp;#34;boil to fit perfectly&amp;#34; kind don&#x27;t work...</li>
            <li>Went back to see the dentist with more pain</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t last more than an hour before I took them out.</li>
            <li>well it will only get better as I continue to get used to the feeling.</li>
            <li>The guard was so big that the front connector didn&#x27;t even come close to touching my gums.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>I can usually get about a good weeks worth of use from one pair, but still, I like how they perform.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty</li>
            <li>I have used one guard for several weeks or more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I discovered these at CVS a few years ago &amp; immediately LOVED them &amp; sleep with them nightly.  </li>
            <li>These were never remotely comfortable, and I gave them a good chance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few mouth guards before without problem, but thought I&#x27;d give these a try since they&#x27;re compact and would be good for travel.</li>
            <li>If you have any teeth missing at all, this would not be a good one for you.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They&#x27;re small but adequate for most people, I would think, unless you have a huge jaw.</li>
            <li>I found that these work better than the alternatives because they are thinner and a slimmer, less intrusive fit.</li>
            <li>It stays in my mouth all night and is very comfortable...plus the price is right.</li>
            <li>This, in rare occasions, may cause sensitivity of those individual teeth because the load is not spread over more teeth (like a normal bite).</li>
            <li>All the other mouth guard products I&#x27;ve tried haven&#x27;t even come close to doing the kind of thorough job that this product does 24/7.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried pretty much every night guard on the market and this one ranks roughly in 3rd of my top 3</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that all night guards will eventually need replacing, and if you try it and like it, it may turn out to be a cost effective solution for your nighttime grinding compared to other night guards.</li>
            <li>They are super comfortable &amp; last MUCH longer than the recommended 3 days for me.  </li>
            <li>I am devastated to have lost it and will most likely replace it before wasting too much money on these poorly-made stop-gap solutions.</li>
            <li>And I am able to make one last a whole week.  </li>
            <li>Good alternative to the more expensive options.</li>
            <li>think my custom guard actually encouraged me to grind even more b/c it provided so much</li>
            <li>If you have a large mouth it may not work for you because I bought my first box for my husband and I to both try as we are both nighttime teeth</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;d recommend these if you are POSITIVE</li>
            <li>this worked really well when i first started using it now</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t seem to stop them, and just because my 2 and 3 year old don&#x27;t realize that its gross, I like to get a fresh one after they&#x27;ve had it:)</li>
            <li>but i question how long we can use it safely in the mouth without any repercussions.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s better than having messed up teeth over the long run.</li>
            <li>Much more economical and hygienic than other brands.</li>
            <li>and so my teeth pretty much stay together through the night.</li>
            <li>Comfortable, barely there feel,</li>
            <li>Small, perfect fit even for small mouths.</li>
            <li>Good for small mouth.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft and pliable so they don&#x27;t hurt your gum line or jaw after a full night of grinding.</li>
            <li>I might have TMJ (which they said isn&#x27;t a good mix with these), so that might be the cause, but I&#x27;m not totally sure.  </li>
            <li>Picked it because it had some of the best reviews but stopped using it because it comes loose very easily and might be a choking hazard due to its small size.  </li>
            <li>You can use them for several nights in a row, but I recommend rinsing them every morning and before bed to keep them clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>These are better in one regard to some night guards as they only have pieces that contact your back teeth where most of the grinding action takes place.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how well these work and think they are more comfortable than the other types I have tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other night guards and these are by far the most comfortable and easiest to keep in all night.</li>
            <li>For the past 3-4 years I&#x27;ve been using the Sleepright Secure Comfort Dental Guard which worked OK</li>
            <li>Also, no more jaw pain, they are more comfortable than anything else I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Easy to wear, not bulky like a mouth guard; only covers what needs to be covered.</li>
            <li>I was clenching my teeth and causing fractures that made my teeth super temperature sensitive.  </li>
            <li>Easy to travel with and each one last me a week.</li>
            <li>Its nice because they are not super bulky and there is no boiling and risking burning your mouth.</li>
            <li>I also have an easy gag reflex, this one is the only one of those I tried that did not make me gag.</li>
            <li>It certainly doesn&#x27;t take the place of the non-disposable, moldable solution.</li>
            <li>Got smart and bought these.</li>
            <li>I certainly like the disposable, easy-use aspect.</li>
            <li>I certainly use them for about 7 days each, and don&#x27;t just toss them after 3 nights.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I had two large sores where the sides of the guard broke in the sides of my mouth.</li>
            <li>I have always suffered from bruxism but the nightguards are too large.  </li>
            <li>I really like these because they fit around my retainer, they&#x27;re small and flexible and you can wear them on the top or bottom.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really loose fitting piece of plastic.  </li>
            <li>It was heard to clean, and never really felt completely clean.</li>
            <li>I wear mine facing down, but it is possible to wear them on your top teeth as well if you find it more to your liking.&lt;br</li>
            <li>brand is fantastic and after using for a year I have only seen positive outcomes.  </li>
            <li>Really a top notch product, they are tiny but you will be surprised how well they work!</li>
            <li>This is also cheap enough that tossing the guards after 3 nights is realistic ensuring a clean fresh guard that hasn&#x27;t been chewed or ground to half its original height.</li>
            <li>Initially I had one from the dentist, but I lost it and started to use the Dentek custom comfort, which do work but are too large for me to wear comfortably.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to keep clean, and after the plastic starts feeling a little iffy, I just replace it.  </li>
            <li>Lightweight, fits good in my small mouth, let&#x27;s me breathe easily unlike the single mouthpiece</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, it is the least bulky and most comfortable.</li>
            <li>They really helped me overcome some very severe jaw pain--I don&#x27;t think I could have slept through the night without them; highly recommended!</li>
            <li>and I liked it except that it&#x27;s much more expensive.  </li>
            <li>really keeps my son and I from grinding our teeth at night</li>
            <li>also use them for much longer than the 3 days or whatever you&#x27;re supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I really like theses mouth guards because I don&#x27;t have to spend a fortune at the dentist.</li>
            <li>and it was very helpful.</li>
            <li>There is no way.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re also much cheaper than getting one form the dentist.</li>
            <li>Sometimes causes too much movement</li>
            <li>My jaw joint would hurt too much because it got hyper-extended.  </li>
            <li>These really save my teeth</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t grind my teeth, so I can&#x27;t really speak to that issue.</li>
            <li>I had no idea how much tension</li>
            <li>I grind my teeth at night and these really work.</li>
            <li>These night guards really do work.  </li>
            <li>My custom made night guard met an untimely death, thanks to my dog.</li>
            <li>but it will not be ready for two weeks</li>
            <li>This product not being adjustable also comes at a cost... if your mouth doesn&#x27;t fit it, move on to the next one.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like these.</li>
            <li>I am a bruxor and these really keep me from grinding my teeth.</li>
            <li>When I wake up for the first 10-15 minutes of the day my bite is no longer aligned like normal.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Much cheaper to purchase via amazon than at CVS-type store.</li>
            <li>I really like these.</li>
            <li>it gets more compressed and moves move, possibly slipping off while sleeping.</li>
            <li>(i&#x27;m wearing them on the top) and are showing minimal if any wear  after three days.</li>
            <li>, you get a bunch in the package and they don&#x27;t cost too much.</li>
            <li>This one comes already shaped and it fits comfortable on both upper or lower teeth.</li>
            <li>, that was the part that really bothered me.  </li>
            <li>gave this two stars instead of one just because the middle that holds your teeth apart was fairly comfortable.  </li>
            <li>In practice though, it doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>Nobody wants to look odd.&lt;br /&gt;Ten</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>There seems to be a real concern of accidentally swallowing these.</li>
            <li>Found that it&#x27;s much cheaper to buy them here.</li>
            <li>Basically the whole family wears these now.</li>
            <li>Never realized how much I grind my teeth.</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>my jaw muscles felt very sore</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been quoted as much as $900 for a mouth guard which is basically a scam as is there is no cure for TMJ.</li>
            <li>only concern is if the materials are &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; (e.g. BPA free...)</li>
            <li>I have rheumatoid arthritis and my TMJ is very severe.</li>
            <li>I really like these night guards.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>mouth guard from dentist cracked  last winter it was never as comfortable as these are  /</li>
            <li>I have tried the big, boil and fit mouth guards and the never are in my mouth when I wake up.  </li>
            <li>And over time it turns out this was really happening</li>
            <li>I have found that isn&#x27;t really an issue.  </li>
            <li>They are slim but really do the job.</li>
            <li>Very well constructed and aesthetically pleasing.</li>
            <li>but my grinding is so intense it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I found that I still had teeth contact because this product does not cover the majority of the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now using the \\&quot;Doctor&#x27;s\\&quot; guard and it works much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really grind, I clench, and I also have invisalign, so</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Each one lasts about 3 weeks for me, and they&#x27;re very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much nicer</li>
            <li>Said it would fit upper or lower and I need for lower and it won&#x27;t stay in place.</li>
            <li>and then I&#x27;m ready to throw them away.</li>
            <li>These are really helpful.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even realize I was clenching my teeth until I had a root canal and was experiencing so much pain after from clenching my teeth at night after the procedure.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s looking very promiseing.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work very well for me.</li>
            <li>These really work well.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m really worried about one thing with these.</li>
            <li>So my bite feels really off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I dont really have a problem except</li>
            <li>They are very flimsy and have nothing to hold them to your teeth.</li>
            <li>They fit well either on my upper or lower teeth</li>
            <li>I love that they are soft enough to be comfortable but durable enough to withstand my grinding.</li>
            <li>They are slim and flexible so you can still close your mouth, and they are really unnoticeable once you have them in.  </li>
            <li>They really do the trick for grinding teeth.  </li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t say.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t fit despite trimming and instantly made me gag,</li>
            <li>guards are extremely comfortable,  enabling me to wear them on the upper or lower teeth.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper on line than in the store.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Wound up just going to the dentist and getting a real night guard.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>I sleep well because you don&#x27;t feel these in your mouth as much as others.</li>
            <li>Before I used them, my mouth would hurt so much, that at times I would scream until some a killers started to work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable enough....</li>
            <li>I am really grateful for these.</li>
            <li>and it has absolutely cured my TMJ is a front teeth appliance from chairsidesplint.com.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to pay $500 for the whole mouth guard.  </li>
            <li>Convenient and much cheaper than ones from the dentist.</li>
            <li>but they really help with tooth grinding.</li>
            <li>They really help my wife sleep beter and wake up without jaw pain.</li>
            <li>These disposable mouth guards work very well and stay in place without being obtrusive</li>
            <li>(drove 21 hours straight from Fort Myers to Milwaukee</li>
            <li>so have a glass of water ready.</li>
            <li>Not only do they change the way your teeth fit together</li>
            <li>Cheap enough to throw out after  week&#x27;s use.  </li>
            <li>I really like these mouth guards</li>
            <li>These are simple, comfortable, and disposable.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I will chew them to the point of bleeding, so needed to figure out something to do about it and fast.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really found anything I do not like about them.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s \\&quot;disposable\\&quot;, the plastic is not thin</li>
            <li>The Grind-No-More night protector works very well for me.</li>
            <li>I tried it and really think it helped.  </li>
            <li>These really help with daytime and nighttime grinding.</li>
            <li>After my insurance company declined me for a real mouth guard, I decided to give these a shot.</li>
            <li>Very affordable and very affective.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>This really works and does not bother me a bit while I&#x27;m sleeping.</li>
            <li>and they whole nine yards.</li>
            <li>They should really state in the advertising that this product is NOT ADVISED if you have TMJ.</li>
            <li>but I really like them now.  </li>
            <li>I purchased these because I absolutely did not want to spend $600 on a night guard/bite splint that was offered to me at the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t bother me too much while I sleep.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li>plus it&#x27;s flexible enough to fit my wider jaw.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone with this intense problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pros: no boiling, reasonable price, works/</li>
            <li>:  Before I go to sleep, I lower my jaw as much as possible, and then kind of wiggle it left</li>
            <li>:  Before I go to sleep, I lower my jaw as much as possible, and then kind of wiggle it left</li>
            <li>They have an extremely minimal form that makes wearing them not awkward at all, and they are a hardy plastic that feels comfortable in the mouth.</li>
            <li>use this product at night and take Buddha&#x27;s Herbs Optimum Glucosamine / Chondroitin / MSM Complex.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen some people complain that these are too small for their mouth, but if you read the instructions, that&#x27;s fine, and from experience I can tell you that the size is fine.</li>
            <li>Grind no more are comfortable, allow you to breath and speak easily.  </li>
            <li>The way these are made to fit in your mouth makes them so much better than all of the other standard dental guards that you boil or just pop in.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other products that you boil and mold but they tend to be very bulky and pricey.</li>
            <li>It is small enough to fit in my mouth and is easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>I think the product is okay, but it&#x27;s not really going to solve the particular problem I&#x27;m having.  </li>
            <li>The profile is ridiculously slim and much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>I thought when I ordered them that they would be like every other bite guard and cover all of either the top or the bottom teeth.</li>
            <li>It takes a little to get used to, but it&#x27;s a lot better than those ones you heat with hot water and then mold to your mouth.</li>
            <li>The fit is OK (average size female) and</li>
            <li>This product is much better than expected!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for anyone who does not want a large guard sticking out between there lips.</li>
            <li>These are simple and small, and do a great job of preventing him from grinding.</li>
            <li>clean it daily with mouthwash and/or toothpaste.</li>
            <li>They clean up easily for reuse, but I am not sure if they are recommended for reuse or not.</li>
            <li>They can last way longer than what it says if you keep them clean.  </li>
            <li>much less cumbersome and more comfortable than a regular mouth guard.  </li>
            <li>They are small and fit comfortably.</li>
            <li>At first I was very hesitant to purchase this item; but I&#x27;ve used up a box of 14 so far.</li>
            <li>For a female with a relatively small jaw, these work great.</li>
            <li>Also, for my teeth clenching problem, it seems like I could easily use a single guard for a month if not a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, it wakes me up and easy comes loose in my mouth.</li>
            <li>When you get the package you might be surprised because of the size of the box (the guards sit on your back set of teeth, this is not a full mouth guard), but these are very nice quality.</li>
            <li>I think that the biggest downfall with this grind guard is that it really isn&#x27;t a one-size fits all piece, my bottom row of teeth are not perfectly straight so this guard really didn&#x27;t stay where it should because it couldn&#x27;t be customised to fit.</li>
            <li>aren&#x27;t adjustable and aren&#x27;t quite as long as my SleepTek guard, but after sliding the guard around in my mouth for a bit I found a comfortable position.</li>
            <li>I just brush these when I brush my teeth in the morning and let it dry all day and at night it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>: headaches have completely vanished thanks to this product!</li>
            <li>it covers the back teeth and isnt a full mouth guard.  </li>
            <li>Only the full size guards give you protection without creating movement in your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my month is kind of small</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several other mouth guards, and these by far are the most comfortable.  </li>
            <li>, I had a semi flexible/semi rigid full upper custom mouth guard &amp; i would grind &amp; gnash the hell out of it.....</li>
            <li>This is definitely true as they do not reach my back molars.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re simple and small, and I&#x27;m usually able to forget I&#x27;m wearing them and fall asleep easily.</li>
            <li>so you use them 2 or 3 days and just throw them away and get a new one!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure a single one will last me 50</li>
            <li>The product was fairly comfortable to put on but it didn&#x27;t seem very secure to me and in the middle of the night I was awoken from a dream in which I was trying to remove something stuck in my mouth and obviously it was a reflection of reality because the dental guard was just loose in my mouth, not attached to any</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to see less packaging, lower price or more appliances.</li>
            <li>Sold as more or less disposable, they are reusable.</li>
            <li>I was previously using SleepRight Dental Guard because of its slim profile, but this is even better.</li>
            <li>directions say they are only good for a few days</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s mainly because a)</li>
            <li>Since my kids seem to steal these, super gross, I know,</li>
            <li>When I woke up, I had tremendous pain in the back of my jaw, which Grind No More&lt;br /&gt;did</li>
            <li>I would have actually been better off sleeping without it because it concentrated the pressure on my back molars instead of spreading it out evenly.</li>
            <li>Keep that in mind if you are running low and need to get these in quickly.</li>
            <li>Mine only had mild wear after one night.</li>
            <li>With me, these guards reach to my back bicuspids, and that is more than enough to keep my jaws from clenching.</li>
            <li>I love these mouthguards because they&#x27;re so light and thin.</li>
            <li>These are the only things that have actually worked for my nighttime teeth grinding and actually fit in/stayed in my mouth!</li>
            <li>I have a small mouth and grind pretty severely on most nights.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also just soft enough to be comfortable yet remain effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>particularly for travel.  </li>
            <li>They prevent grinding OK overnight, but breakdown a lot faster than the more expensive ones.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure to wash them the same as you would a regular night guard or a retainer.</li>
            <li>The guards fit really poorly due to their extra soft form and moved around so easily that unless my jaw was super clenched it wouldn&#x27;t stay in properly.</li>
            <li>It interrupts my sleep, and it is a choking hazard - steer very clear of this product!</li>
            <li>bottom line is that these Plackers Mouth Guard Grind No More Dental Night Protectors have worked the best because they take up minimal space in the mouth while still providing sufficient spacing between the upper and lower teeth to protect from grinding.</li>
            <li>I rinse daily in very hot water to get the gunk off.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly, makes my teeth feel a little weird in the morning, but goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>As a longtime, nighttime, teeth grinder, I highly recommend these Plackers mouth guards.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these to anyone needing a bite guard to keep themselves from grinding their teeth at night.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to ease grinding at night.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I bought these with high hopes of helping me with my clinching issue.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Would like the bite part to be a harder material but for three days it should work out fine.</li>
            <li>These are far too large for my mouth.</li>
            <li>Regardless of the size of your mouth, it should be a pretty tight fit between the outer wall of your mouth and your gums</li>
            <li>I love these little guards and replace them monthly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I ordered this, it came no problem, The second time, the status said &amp;#34;delivered&amp;#34; but there was no package, though I suspect certain neighbors found they had mouth guards with no idea what to do with them.</li>
            <li>The cost of doing that with the other brands was adding up very quickly.</li>
            <li>I had hoped that it would be good because I have a small jaw (normal nigh guards are much too large), but it just is not what I expected.</li>
            <li>This was a great alternative to a rather expensive night guard from the dentist.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t understand why the change to this version instead of the old ones.</li>
            <li>These are a great alternative to expensive permanent use custom guards.</li>
            <li>Unlike other night guards, they are not a full mouth guard, they fit like a retainer on the top OR bottom teeth, whichever you prefer.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a weird feeling in my mouth but the work great during the day...</li>
            <li>...figured they&#x27;d fall out easily or be uncomfortable, but they&#x27;re great.  </li>
            <li>nights I have a harder time getting comfortable with it</li>
            <li>For the extra $.19 each, it is worth buying through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>You can barely notice it after the first couple of nights.</li>
            <li>These are better than a full mouth guard because the plastic in front is so thin.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the try and definitely cheaper than getting  a device from your dentist.</li>
            <li>My bite has now returned to a normal feeling.</li>
            <li>The instructions say not to use if you are missing 2 or more teeth, but I don&#x27;t know why.  </li>
            <li>After a few nights, I got used to it, and now I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>but for now I am on auto delivery as you can no longer find them in the store and the cost is pretty much the same.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After just a couple days, I feel almost completely normal again.  </li>
            <li>I have some missing molars on both the top and bottom of my mouth and</li>
            <li>They help without hurting your teeth or being bulky like the normal mouth guards.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also read reviews saying they aren&#x27;t good for clenching as they stay in one place and hurt your gums or direct the pressure to only a few teeth - HERE</li>
            <li>It seemed to work fine for other people.  </li>
            <li>I like that they are flexible and not a hard rigid guard on your teeth.  </li>
            <li>These last me a week or so, and then I get to throw it out and have a brand new fresh one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smaller and less bulky than the one I&#x27;d used that I&#x27;d liked from Target.</li>
            <li>These last 2-3 weeks easily and even then only seem to lose some of their springiness rather than wearing through.</li>
            <li>: If you have a strong jaw/bite like me and they aren&#x27;t too small that you&#x27;d swallow them, - you&#x27;ll end up flattening it out after the first night or two</li>
            <li>They slip right between your back teeth and are unobtrusive.</li>
            <li>These fit a little too large for my mouth.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if placker is the only device that is contributing to this new problem, but it can on top of the others I&#x27;ve mentioned: chewing on side and a lot of jaw action in trying to keep my teeth/gum clean.  </li>
            <li>I have struggled with several other brands out there (dentek custom comfort dental guard, sleep right slim comfort and sleep right secure comfort) - but sleeping with giant mouthpieces in your mouth is not comforable.</li>
            <li>The only issue is they don&#x27;t put material between all your teeth, just the main group of grinders - not a problem for me as my tooth squeezing is pretty even.</li>
            <li>- other night guards I&#x27;ve tried were so huge, I couldn&#x27;t sleep at all.</li>
            <li>These fit extremely well and don&#x27;t move around.</li>
            <li>I have tried other mouth guards, but none have been comfortable.</li>
            <li>have never had it fall out at night and when you wake up it is true that at first you feel like your jaw is a little misaligned, but trust me that resolves in like 10 minutes and it&#x27;s not severe....</li>
            <li>These seem good, though they are a little rough.  </li>
            <li>The good thing about these is that one is able to close ones mouth whereas other mouth guards are bulk and hard to keep mouth closed.  </li>
            <li>My dentist is making me a new one tomorrow</li>
            <li>You can use a new one every night if you want to, but each guard is usable for 3 days a piece.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t afford a new one, so</li>
            <li>Then just throw it away and get a brand new one.  </li>
            <li>I use mine for 5-7 days then throw it out and use a new one.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t live without them.</li>
            <li>I had a mouth guard made which cost $$$$ but with new crowns etc</li>
            <li>After three days, you throw it out and switch to a new one, which you would want to anyway because they do start to flatten out around day three anyway.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Snug, custom fit, never falls off, tiny, easy to wear, and was slowly teaching my body to stop grinding my teeth.</li>
            <li>The mouth guard is kind of flimsy, but its only meant to be used for a few days.</li>
            <li>They are flexible, light weight, and simple to use on your upper or lower teeth.  </li>
            <li>I suggest buying a smaller quantity to see how these fit before buying the larger value pack here.</li>
            <li>Now, i&#x27;m waking up in the middle of the night because my bottom jaw is constantly trying to find a comfortable resting place while using this.</li>
            <li>And mostly just because I misplaced the old one and figured it was time to change it</li>
            <li>Have tried more expensive mouth guards and could never find any that were as comfortable as these.</li>
            <li>The plastic is very soft (think day-old gummy bear candy-ish), and they don&#x27;t rub your gums.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll</li>
            <li>The Plackers are very soft, but I don&#x27;t think I might buy again since they adjust my teeth while I use them.</li>
            <li>The part in the middle that keeps your teeth apart was actually OK, and I was surprised to find that I could fall asleep with it in with not too much trouble on the first night of wearing it.  </li>
            <li>I currently do not need to use them, but I also cannot attribute the remedy to just these mouth guards; I also successfully reduced my stress (which was the main culprit behind my teeth</li>
            <li>They seem to be based on a small set of perfect teeth and a very weak bite… in which case, you wouldn&#x27;t need a mouth guard for in the first place.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of mouth guards, including the custom ones from the dentist, and I&#x27;ve pretty much given up on every single one.</li>
            <li>Definitely works as a tooth that had been sore before due to the grinding is much better now.</li>
            <li>No More guards serve their purpose better than $700, custom made dental appliances</li>
            <li>I was worried as to how exactly it would stay in my mouth, but the fact that when I put it in no one could tell that it was in left me hopeful still.</li>
            <li>I remedied this by placing the protector in a pot of hot (not boiling) water for about 10 seconds, just like you do with the regular boil n&#x27; bite protectors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my 2nd week with the first one</li>
            <li>Even with the hot water stretching treatment, the guards still do not reach all the way to the back teeth.</li>
            <li>They are not terribly uncomfortable but definitely took me an hour to fall asleep with it</li>
            <li>I believe this has more to do with the variations in my grinding than variations in the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given that this product is designed to be disposable, I definitely recommend the Plackers as a first-line product before moving to more expensive ones.</li>
            <li>I just tried these for the first time last night</li>
            <li>They are soft enough to be comfortable yet sturdy enough to stay in place &amp; protect your teeth.</li>
            <li>These do not over all your teeth, but do provide a biting/clinching/grinding area made of soft plastic that takes the damage your teeth normally would.  </li>
            <li>I thought I might accidentally choke on them at first, but they totally stay in place.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t keep them in for a significant amount of time due to this.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it seems to work better than the larger guards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I sleep like a baby now, and no more headaches :)</li>
            <li>The sixty dollar drugstore model was ok too but the dog got that one also.(dogs name is SLICK</li>
            <li>The positioning keeps my jaw slightly open and any of my teeth from touching each other, so I for one do not have to worry about my teeth clenching problem any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>not sure I wasn&#x27;t clenching my teeth even more to compensate.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find my back teeth touching like one of the other reviews said.</li>
            <li>If the company re-designs the product, I might try it out again as I like having these simple disposable ones vs putting the same one in for 6 months - a year (call me OCD, as much as I clean em</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a few of the boilable/adjustable ones, but no matter how much I kept them clean, my teeth and gums felt \\&quot;trapped\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>then the user can just cut down to fit the length of their bite.</li>
            <li>then the user can just cut down to fit the length of their bite.</li>
            <li>I know that some mornings I wake up and feel the tops of my teeth where these are being clenched down on seems smooth.  </li>
            <li>major CHOKING HAZARD!!!</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to receiving this because of its high reviews and because it looked like a similar sample product my orthodontist gave me for my tmj.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so the typical mouth guards don&#x27;t fit or stay in place during the night.  </li>
            <li>I realized this doesn&#x27;t exactly fit my mouth about a week in a half in.</li>
            <li>500 dollar bite guards from the dentist are way less comfortable than these.</li>
            <li>The first night I used it, only minutes after dozing off, miraculously I woke myself up nearly choking on the mouth piece.</li>
            <li>Even though they are advertised as disposable, I&#x27;ve been able to use a single guard for a few weeks (just disinfect it the same way you would a full size guard).</li>
            <li>Had a miss aliened crown with a bad bite causing unwanted wear on my crown as I slept and this guard stopped the sleep grinding damage on the crown ,also fits nicely on upper or lower and stayed in my mouth the hole night without falling out and caused no breathing problems, I highly recommend this product for its excellent design and  fare price!</li>
            <li>But this is based on my own clinching habits - if you clinch harder they may not last as long.  </li>
            <li>These barely fit my 9 year old daughter&#x27;s mouth, much less mine.</li>
            <li>I keep them next to my bed, and next to the couch in case I get a chance to take a quick nap.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There are a ton of more expensive, less effective solutions out there.  </li>
            <li>I have a large mouth and it left two teeth uncovered on all four side.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased this product from a store that had marked it down, lower than the price sold here.  </li>
            <li>These little fellers are fantastic.</li>
            <li>was a little concerned because they don&#x27;t fit like the dental night guard I had.</li>
            <li>They last as long as the Dentek guards, are easier to clean (one rubber piece, not an assembled piece with crevices), and I don&#x27;t grind the rubber off like I do with the Dentek guards.</li>
            <li>It even left little marks on my front teeth that are now more prone to staining.  </li>
            <li>They felt a little funny at first, but after one night of wearing them, I got used to it.</li>
            <li>Partial and full mouth &#x27;boil to fit&#x27; small retainer types including the little adjustable comfort fit ones.</li>
            <li>Within a couple nights wear, the affected fractured tooth calmed down, and am very pleased with this little soft appliance.</li>
            <li>in my experience the hard plastic ones from the dentist work a lot better (although they&#x27;re obviously a lot more expensive) for getting you to grind less-the chewy soft disposable ones just make you more likely to chew on them.</li>
            <li>still have the occasional dream about chewing a really bad hamburger, or some gum, but am so happy to wake up chomping on this mouthguard rather than degrading my teeth!</li>
            <li>still have the occasional dream about chewing a really bad hamburger, or some gum, but am so happy to wake up chomping on this mouthguard rather than degrading my teeth!</li>
            <li>So clearly there will be NO protection for my teeth.</li>
            <li>which isn&#x27;t clear to me...</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t have TMJ, but if you&#x27;re unsure, I&#x27;d steer clear.</li>
            <li>far, 5 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Can a 4 year old wear these.</li>
            <li>However this isn&#x27;t a con for us since he prefers to switches them out frequently.</li>
            <li>While you could use these just once and dispose of them, I have been able to use them over and over again (I rinse them well after using and store them during the day in a container with some mouth wash) for at least two weeks.</li>
            <li>After 1 night of using this product I noticed it completely adjusted my bite.  </li>
            <li>He recommended a &amp;#34;boil &amp; bite&amp;#34; if you can&#x27;t afford the professional one he would make in the lab.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re so soft.</li>
            <li>I can see just one lasting me for weeks, maybe a whole month.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m a 24 yr old girl...</li>
            <li>At this rate, I won&#x27;t be surprised if the box of fourteen lasts for years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, I decided to give these a shot since they are so much cheaper and the shape was similar.</li>
            <li>They are too big, but the most important is that they slip on the sides, which mades them useless.</li>
            <li>I am on a fixed income and cannot afford crowns.  </li>
            <li>I guess if you find yourself unexpectedly spending the night out.  </li>
            <li>She is 7 years old and as she has starte to get all of her adult teeth</li>
            <li>The Plackers product are clearly marked as disposable and are recommended for only 1-3 uses before disposing; however, they are far and away the cheapest of the reasonably highly-rated products on Amazon, so I thought I&#x27;d start there.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how well they work...</li>
            <li>I felt the difference after one night and now my 9yr old son uses them.  </li>
            <li>Pleasantly Surprised.</li>
            <li>My old guards would leave&lt;br /&gt;ridges and sore marks on my side gums.</li>
            <li>Plus Amazon offers an auto ship program that just sends them monthly.</li>
            <li>(however, if the company developed one with a shorter \\&quot;bridge,\\</li>
            <li>(I try to avoid too much plastic exposure when possible)</li>
            <li>(I try to avoid too much plastic exposure when possible)</li>
            <li>I tend to chew more with something in my mouth but at least its not teeth against teeth</li>
            <li>My husband uses these, he really does not like the bigger ones.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a concern enough not to try these if you really know you&#x27;re grinding at night.</li>
            <li>I have had the professionally made grind guards before and they never stayed in my mouth, they just ended up lost in the sheets.</li>
            <li>These guys went directly in the trash afterwards.</li>
            <li>I also use Young Living oil Valor, rubbed on the jaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I believe this caused some motion of the teeth themselves that resulted in considerable pain on one molar and that side of my face.  </li>
            <li>so soft.  </li>
            <li>I can never throw away my old plates.  </li>
            <li>They are soft, so I still grind which doesn&#x27;t alleviate jaw and head aches</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if they work as well as the professionally made ones</li>
            <li>thing that surprised me about this was the size and how its made.  </li>
            <li>These are not going to work for anyone as far as I can tell..</li>
            <li>just get a professional one done...</li>
            <li>After wearing it, I had somewhat of a naturally tendency to not clench my teeth,</li>
            <li>the bite guards are further back, and if it islarger they are closer to the front, but the function and tight/secure fit would seem to be the same for anybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I grind my teeth so much that I&#x27;ve had to get multiple drillings on the molars to fix &#x27;em.</li>
            <li>She likes them and is surprised that they have lasted as long as they have since at first glance</li>
            <li>They were ok but did not fit my mouth and constantly fell out.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re effective, thus far, and my only complaint is the brand-name raise-printed on it, which abrades the skin it touches.</li>
            <li>One size most definitely does not fit all.</li>
            <li>I spent thousands of dollars worth of custom made anti-grind contraptions &amp; chewed thru them all.</li>
            <li>The guards are too thick and bulky, plus they don&#x27;t fit well in my month!</li>
            <li>Dental work, even with good dental benefits, are expensive.  </li>
            <li>At least Plackers acknowledges it and give you a box full at a reasonable price so you can discard one and start new.  </li>
            <li>(The sleep right were smaller, but they were too deep and hurt my gums).</li>
            <li>For day to day I use the Sleep Right Dental Guard, which is larger, and the bite wings pivot, so it is actually a three-part guard.</li>
            <li>Unless you are constantly biting down on it, it slides out of place easily.  </li>
            <li>I first put on my lower teeth and it seemed a little large.  </li>
            <li>They are small and easy to use.</li>
            <li>review is after only using it one night, but to counter some other reviews I saw I would like to suggest that one size should fit all.  </li>
            <li>Having used full mouth guards for my teeth grinding for years, these seemed like a novel solution and less of a mouthful, as it were.  </li>
            <li>After a few days of using another device that is bigger between the top and bottom jaw, everything went back to normal.</li>
            <li>I was fairly skeptical at first, especially after opening the package to see what they actually looked like, but it does seem fairly well</li>
            <li>the bite part was a bit thicker as I do wear them down quite quickly.</li>
            <li>The pads that protect your teeth are only about a 3/4 of an inch long and fit on your back molars.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that some nights they rub up against my gums as they fit a little too snuggly which is surprising considering I have a pretty small mouth.</li>
            <li>they are only one small piece, I thought it would fit my whole mouth.</li>
            <li>No more headaches and more important, no more dizzy spells!</li>
            <li>They only go back to the first molar.  </li>
            <li>They were actually too small in my opinion, more like child size.</li>
            <li>first night pit it in only 30 mins, 2nd night 2hrs</li>
            <li>I got the small package the first time just to try them out, so I would recommend that for a first time trial.</li>
            <li>I was experiencing major tooth aches and jaw pain from the grinding, but that completely went away after I started using these guards.</li>
            <li>main reason I like them so much is they are not  bulky like the other mouth guards on the market</li>
            <li>happening.&lt;br /&gt;The price is right, and cheaper than other products that claim to be dental-quality.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t rate that this high enough!!!!</li>
            <li>I agree with other reviews that as long as you clean them each morning, these should last much longer than 3 days each.</li>
            <li>had previously used fitted mouth guards (boil in water to form fit), but they always felt too big and cumbersome.  </li>
            <li>I notice my grinding was getting bad again more recently, I tried looking for better alternatives.</li>
            <li>Not good then :-)</li>
            <li>and it really solved the problem I have with grinding and clenching teeth for a long time.</li>
            <li>They do fit a small mouth.</li>
            <li>Small and comfortable...</li>
            <li>Comfortable, prevents me from grinding (which I&#x27;ve cracked teeth in the past doing).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The first two nights were rough.  </li>
            <li>it took me all day exercising my jaw to get it back to it&#x27;s normal alignment.</li>
            <li>But, for me after each night of use, my teeth don&#x27;t bite together as they normally should and thus will grind on edges after these are taken out for hours the next day.  </li>
            <li>These Plackers protected exactly where I clench and grind, with minimal invasion to my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I feel that these encourage me to clench my teeth more due to the guard not staying in place and having biting down to hold it.</li>
            <li>They are so small and low key, it&#x27;s easy to forget you&#x27;re even wearing one!</li>
            <li>They are large enough to not get accidently swallowed but small enough that it is comfortable in her mouth.  </li>
            <li>These little pads fit in your mouth with no extra boiling, shaping, or discomfort.</li>
            <li>These little mouthguards are comfortable enough to wear at night and even during exercise or just when you&#x27;re stressed and tend to clench or grind your teeth.  </li>
            <li>REALLY hard to get used to as they don&#x27;t fit well into an adult sized mouth.  </li>
            <li>Can easily wear them on the upper or lower teeth (kind of prefer the lower myself), and after one night of feeling a little weird with something in my mouth at bedtime, I had no problems.  </li>
            <li>I lost my custom mouth guard recently and i was trying to avoid paying another $450 to get a new one.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t see myself paying  $30+ for guards that either had to be constantly replaced by warranty or replaced by a new one.</li>
            <li>I went to my dentist last October for a new bite guard, and it cost $550.</li>
            <li>the when done throw awAy and open new one thank you</li>
            <li>They also don&#x27;t dry out my teeth by covering too much side surface.</li>
            <li>They are very flexible and low profile and can be used either on the upper or lower teeth.  </li>
            <li>They absolutely prevent grinding and chomping, and I personally wash them and use them for a couple of weeks (even though the package recommends only 3 days of use per guard).  </li>
            <li>One piece of advice though: wear it on your bottom teeth because I&#x27;ve come to realize that when you wear it on the top, it falls out while you&#x27;re sleeping (at least for me since I tend to sleep with my mouth open at times).</li>
            <li>I recommend finding a single package (they come in a box of 30 for $20+ dollars) before buying a whole pack.</li>
            <li>I wore it for years, but I would still wake up with major headaches.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t fit right and was uncomfortable</li>
            <li>Also, if you&#x27;re not familiar with this product, know that in most cases it means you&#x27;ll sleep with your mouth open and wake up dry...</li>
            <li>easy to use, doesn&#x27;t hurt the teeth or gums, not too big, not too small for the mouth.</li>
            <li>For a few weeks I have been chewing food mostly on one side to avoid food stuck in the other side where I had the infection.</li>
            <li>My jaw feels a little funny after I take the guard out in the morning, but I imagine that&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not perfect, and they certainly don&#x27;t fit like a custom guard, but for the price they are a very reasonable solution.</li>
            <li>These have been a lifesaver to me over the last several years highly recommend</li>
            <li>After several sleepless nights I stumbled across these mouth guards on Amazon; we both didn&#x27;t have high hopes, since they seem kinda tiny, and flimsy.</li>
            <li>I have a small jaw and reading the reviews I had pretty high hopes.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine as you are supposed to replace it every few days!!  </li>
            <li>They are small and light, but if you put them in properly, you shouldn&#x27;t have an issue.</li>
            <li>However given enough time will soft plastic pushing on the mouth change appearance?</li>
            <li>I wore these for a month straight and had absolutely NO relief in my jaw pain from clenching.</li>
            <li>This is the only mouth guard that works for my teeth so far.</li>
            <li>The plastic is soft but sturdy at the same time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using them about 2 weeks now and was hoping it would stop hurting, but it just scrapes the sensitive gums enough to hurt</li>
            <li>Neither can stop your clenching or the grinding action you make with your mouth, they only protect your teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this fall after dental work and my habit of clenching left my teeth extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li>Initially,the upper teeth were sensitive to the thing.  </li>
            <li>With this mouthpiece, I barely know its in</li>
            <li>and you can barely notice you are using them while sleeping.</li>
            <li>They are way too soft and actually lead to a lot of jaw soreness</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried at least a dozen different brands, and all seem to be too big and bulky to be able to sleep well with.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wear the bigger mouth guards at night because I never fall asleep - they don&#x27;t feel natural.</li>
            <li>Basically your tongue never touches them and they&#x27;re far enough forward to avoid feeling like you&#x27;re swallowing a piece of plastic.  </li>
            <li>I was clenching my jaw at night apparently without realizing it.</li>
            <li>They might be useful for traveling, or to address a temporary situation, but they&#x27;re too flimsy for everyday use.</li>
            <li>I wear the mouth guard every other night, and it is so durable that I can actually reuse it (as long as keeping it clean).</li>
            <li>First night down</li>
            <li>Well if you have that big of mouth or don&#x27;t constantly clench your teeth throughout the night so they stay put, I would recommend buying a single pair from Walgreens first before investing in a multipack.</li>
            <li>I replaced the first one after month and a half.</li>
            <li>These unique mouth guards are very different from the usual ones.  </li>
            <li>And they aren&#x27;t bulky, they are very light weight and thin, but substantial enough that someone who has ground holes in sports mouth guards over time, like me, can still use it for 3 nights</li>
            <li>It does protect your teeth from grinding each other but i always wake up with jaw muscles feeling very tensed up and sore instead.</li>
            <li>In fact I think I was clenching harder because it feels like it destabilizes my bite and my teeth don&#x27;t really know where to settle...kind of like chewing two pieces of old gum all night long.</li>
            <li>I always bought the no-boil dental guards, but they are so hard to keep clean.  </li>
            <li>that &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; on each other now thanks to years of TMJ and a crappy dental procedure 20 yrs ago.  </li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t go far enough back to stop the Jaw from closing.</li>
            <li>They have a soft chewy pad on each side in the back and when you close your back teeth into the pad</li>
            <li>Both the professional guard at $500, and the Plackers Mouth Guard adds a buffer between your upper and lower teeth that prevents that physical grinding  damage.  </li>
            <li>The insides poke my tongue and the band doesn&#x27;t go far enough into the back of your mouth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried most of them and they&#x27;re uncomfortable, even the professionally fitted ones from the dentist.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They are inconspicuous--no more feeling like you have a giant wad of plastic in your mouth--and they don&#x27;t make you look like you&#x27;re about to hit the ice hockey rink for a playoff game.</li>
            <li>Not so fast , right i realized i had to bite down a little harder then normal to keep it in my mouth</li>
            <li>By having such a small area of product to absorb and distribute the sometimes very strong forces of nighttime tooth grinding, it seems that the teeth above and below where you bite down on the product take the brunt of that pressure.  </li>
            <li>These little dudes are absolutely a God-send!  </li>
            <li>Took a little while to get used to them, as I want to chew on them when I first put one in my mouth.</li>
            <li>A little plastic for 6-8 hours a night would take years to move it a little and its more likely that what change you did make at night would revert during the day.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t generally have a problem with the Sleep Right falling out, but the Sleep Right is extremely expensive</li>
            <li>These Plackers are totally the way to go - cheap and small!</li>
            <li>They have a small piece that runs along the front of your top or bottom teeth and are connected to small but useful pieces of plastic to bite down on.  </li>
            <li>I woke up in the morning with the little, tiny guard still in place, teeth that didn&#x27;t feel like cotton on them from having a mouth guard encasing them in so much plastic wrap, and you could clearly see my teeth marks on the plastic.  </li>
            <li>These are small and fold easily in your mouth if you are note careful.</li>
            <li>Very soft and thin, better than any other guards I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The only downside I can see is that if you have a very large mouth, they may not fit well.</li>
            <li>try to sell you, or to the ones that say they last 3-6 months but are hard to keep clean.</li>
            <li>Maybe this works for protecting against grinding, but I&#x27;m not sure the cost of an adjusted bite is worth it.</li>
            <li>I can usually get a weeks worth of wearing out of them.  </li>
            <li>Since I have teeth missing on the top, I used it on the bottom as there is only one missing.  </li>
            <li>It is a good concept, but it is a very poor product!  </li>
            <li>My son said it&#x27;s thicker than his previous ones, so a bit less comfortable in the mouth.</li>
            <li>I can use it for a week or two no problem before it gets ground down too much.</li>
            <li>Does the job, and is a lot more comfortable and less expensive than other over the counter products I have used.</li>
            <li>The current size could be for small mouths and then make a slightly thicker (1/16&amp;#34;) one for bigger mouths, because I am thinking that very large mouths could just move the guard around at night.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s much cheaper than the SleepRight—for about half the price of one night guard, you get 14.</li>
            <li>Small, comfortable and allows you to keep your mouth closed.</li>
            <li>just unbelievably nice.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update the post later if it starts to perform less than stellar, but if the first night went this</li>
            <li>I have only had one minor headache so far since I began using these things six weeks ago.</li>
            <li>After you open them there is no case so he just pops it in a small baggie, add a couple drops of mouthwash to keep it fresh.</li>
            <li>They are small and it&#x27;s nice that they are disposable, so when they get icky, I just throw them out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thickness of pads -&lt;br /&gt;They aren&#x27;t super thick, but I don&#x27;t grind, so it&#x27;s not an issue for me.</li>
            <li>But I got tired of tasting and swallowing the strong Plastic Chemical taste these have.  </li>
            <li>My very back teeth were still able to connect because I bite down so hard, and I think I was grinding the protector INTO my mouth-flesh with my sideways grind, which caused the sores.</li>
            <li>My first attempt to use it was a complete failure.  </li>
            <li>These really help me sleep at night without disturbing my better half.</li>
            <li>By too big, I mean the bridge was too long and wouldn&#x27;t fit over my teeth properly and stay put.</li>
            <li>So at night I was grinding down hard enough, that my back teeth were still touching and were producing a jaw-not-aligned properly feeling for the next several days after wearing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really stay in place and since I move my tongue when I rest or sleep, it dislodges the little pad that rests on the teeth on either side.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They don&#x27;t look like much, but you feel like you are treating yourself when you see all the neatly stacked little packages.  </li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s not going to really be prevented by these little guys.  </li>
            <li>No such luck, because they are not long enough to cover your back teeth.</li>
            <li>As other folks have mentioned, this is a nighuard you can live with.</li>
            <li>other concern was that when I bite down on the thing when I&#x27;m awake, it actually tends to slip out of place and my teeth go right back together.  </li>

            <li> great product</li>
            <li> Its a great concept, but I think they need to either make some child size or not advertise the &amp;#34;one size...</li>

            <li> Great product at a great price..</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s great about them is that you can pack one (or two) for a trip, and still have some at home.  </li>
            <li> great alternative to having one made ($$$)</li>
            <li> These work great</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> In my mouth, these work great.</li>
            <li> These are probably great if all you do is grind</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand for awhile - work well for me - great price and value - saved lots of $</li>
            <li> I normally am happy with all items purchased through Amazon</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> They have worked really great for me and have helped a lot.</li>
            <li> So happy I ordered them.</li>
            <li> Amazon was great about sending out a replacement order and THAT one showed up on time.</li>
            <li> Great for traveling, if you lose it..you have extras.</li>
            <li> When I wake up in the morning my teeth feel great</li>
            <li> This is really great product for dental guard.</li>
            <li> The guards also didn&#x27;t feel especially secure--</li>
            <li> Great Product.</li>
            <li> This may work great for others, however.  </li>
            <li> Works great, didn&#x27;t think they would even looking at them in my hand</li>
            <li> Product is Great.</li>
            <li> is a great solution.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THEM!!</li>
            <li> These are amazing!  </li>
            <li> What I am impressed with most is the fact that I can use them over and over.  </li>
            <li> I love this product because it fits my bite perfectly!</li>
            <li> two was better , day three was perfect</li>
            <li> I find it best to switch up from top to bottom from  time to time because it seems that I figure out ways in my sleep to clench or grind when I get used to it.  </li>
            <li> Good thing they were cheap!!!</li>
            <li> Just the fact that it was still in place in the morning was amazing, and I felt happy I&#x27;d done something to protect my teeth-</li>
            <li> Okay i liked the 600 dollar mouth guard best</li>
            <li> Not so good because if I sleep with this in my mouth, I&#x27;ll choke to death.  </li>
            <li> Maybe good for daytime if you have an injured lip or something like that.</li>
            <li> Does the job at a good price.  </li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> These work good.  </li>
            <li> (That&#x27;s what I do already, but it was good to know</li>
            <li> (That&#x27;s what I do already, but it was good to know it&#x27;s not harmful.)</li>
            <li> This is a good solution if you suspect you are grinding.</li>
            <li> It is a good product and I buy it often</li>
            <li> I thought these would be a good solution</li>
            <li> Works good...</li>
            <li> Fits good, not obtrusive like a sports mouth guard.</li>
            <li> but these work best and are cheap.  </li>
            <li> This is a good schedule for economy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a good product for the money.</li>
            <li> This is good</li>
            <li> As good as it gets for over the counter</li>
            <li> A good idea would be for Plackers to extend the plastic tabs (make them longer)</li>
            <li> A good idea would be for Plackers to extend the plastic tabs (make them longer)</li>
            <li> Reusable 3 times which is also good.</li>
            <li> Just a good as the night guards you have to mold.</li>
            <li> surprisingly they stay put.  </li>
            <li> Good Value.</li>
            <li> Definitely a good value.</li>
            <li> good quality</li>
            <li> If you looking for guard, it&#x27;s a good one to try.</li>
            <li> good guard and affortable</li>
            <li> This is a good buy, no uncomfortableness when I am sleeping.</li>
            <li> For the price it is good.</li>
            <li> Good luck.</li>
            <li> This is a good price too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to report that they have liked them as well.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t let this review ruin all the good reviews this product has received.</li>
            <li> I used to have guards many years ago but always bit through them.&lt;br /&gt;After using these they aggravated my jaw so incredibly</li>
            <li> but if I find a good solution, I&#x27;ll update this review.</li>
            <li> This guard keeps my teeth apart, fits perfectly in my mouth,is comfortable, and the dog seems not to like it.</li>
            <li> These were good, but i had one made at the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Good to use while driving.</li>
            <li> Best product available</li>
            <li> These seem to work just as good and they are disposable.</li>
            <li> These work surprisingly well, with no discomfort.</li>
            <li> I thought these were awesome because I slept better and felt like they allowed me to feel more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; while wearing them.</li>
            <li> I tried using it on the top and the bottom teeth, and top works best for me.  </li>
            <li> It was more cost effective and even better, it works great!!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> It was all that said and much more , I am happy with my perchance and can sleep and get up with out pain</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> PS does not interfer with talking or drinking and most people do not know I am wearing the guard, which is great.</li>
            <li> These fit perfectly on either top or bottom.  </li>
            <li> I found for me the best fit is to put on top</li>
            <li> Best and most comfortable grind guards I can find.</li>
            <li> Plackers helping me not ruin any more fillings or chip teeth from grind/clenching when i sleep!</li>
            <li> I love these!  </li>
            <li> Fabulous for traveling!!</li>
            <li> And they&#x27;re sure cheaper than what the dentist recommends!</li>
            <li> I LOVE these!</li>
            <li> I LOVE these guards!</li>
            <li> I love these things!  </li>
            <li> You will be so pleased, and your dentist will thank you!</li>
            <li> Love these!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love them!</li>
            <li> Dunno how safe or recommended that can be, but I do it anyways :P</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how I would feel about this, but they work so well!  </li>
            <li> I was unsure if these would work, but after one night of using this I felt much better!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe they don&#x27;t advertise this product more!  </li>
            <li> first night, it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> but this is much better than $600!</li>
            <li> After just one night of using these I love them!  </li>
            <li> Great for those of us who lose things easily.  </li>
            <li> Amazing how these work.  </li>
            <li> Now if these mouthguards would work on my mouthy cat, that would be amazing.</li>
            <li> These work and fit well and are a great deal.</li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d be happy to sleep with a hunk of plastic in my mouth, but it&#x27;s a huge comfort to know I&#x27;m not wrecking my teeth, brushing doesn&#x27;t hurt now, and I don&#x27;t have a headache when I wake up.</li>
            <li> : The flexible fit of these is still great.</li>
            <li> Noticeably effective within one week.</li>
            <li> You can use them with the band around your bottom teeth or top teeth which is good to have that option (illustration on the package).</li>
            <li> Getting them through Amazon is the best bet as they are much cheaper here than in a drug store.  </li>
            <li> It was nice while it lasted.</li>
            <li> my son cant stand the guards that you have to warm &amp; then mold to your mouth....</li>
            <li> Kind of defeats the purpose I thought.</li>
            <li> The fact I can throw them away is good, more sanitary.</li>
            <li> According to the company&#x27;s own literature, they can be used for \\&quot;up to three nights\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this kind of mouth guard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that it is disposable also.</li>
            <li> They did seem to stay in but seemed to add their own discomfort</li>
            <li> Wonderful - highly recommended!</li>
            <li> and they are still effective.</li>
            <li> I would not buy these again, instead I have purchased the Doctors night guard which you boil and in conforms to your own teeth.</li>
            <li> and then place it in my mouth and kind of suck it into place it stays in place longer.  </li>
            <li> Its a good guard that goes along with my retainer for my top and bottom.</li>
            <li> And to be honest, I think it is helping my bite.  </li>
            <li> Each mouthpiece is packaged in its own sealed container.  </li>
            <li> I grind my teeth a lot, so I always keep one handy in case</li>
            <li> I own a dental mouth guard.</li>
            <li> It fits in nice and it&#x27;s not invasive in my mouth.</li>
            <li> What is nice is you do not have to soak these or keep them in water.  </li>
            <li> How effective they are</li>
            <li> These nightime guards are superior to any form fitting teeth guard.</li>
            <li> Well made, excellent price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> So I really kind of bought this as an impulse buy.  </li>
            <li> To be totally honest, I had put it in my cart, lost interest and went on Facebook.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that they will realty help me, but I bought they because of many good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They say these are 3-day guards, but honestly, I use them for longer than that.</li>
            <li> The Grind-No-More is a good fit for me and does the job!</li>
            <li> It is also reasonably priced, so perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> They are kind of pricey for as often as you have to replace them.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> Your best off buying a higher end mouth guard or better yet a mouth piece made for you by your dentist.</li>
            <li> Clean and great for travel.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and i really really love it -- it is so easy to use in an effort to protect your teeth.</li>
            <li> great alternative to a full night guard.  </li>
            <li> These are great night guards for those of us that grind our teeth, but can&#x27;t stand a full size mouth guard.</li>
            <li> If they attached a bit more securely, they&#x27;d be great.  </li>
            <li> good price and easy to use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying two more to make sure I have a good supply.</li>
            <li> Still kind of surprised, but these work great!!!</li>
            <li> Very easy to choke on if you are a mouth breather while sleeping.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it should be ok for most!</li>
            <li> These are perfect because they fit just right</li>
            <li> Bought these for my dear husband, so I can&#x27;t speak for him (although when I asked, he said they fit okay), but I am super happy with them because they stop him from grinding his teeth!</li>
            <li> Good fit for an over the counter mouth guard.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for grinding/clenching at night.</li>
            <li> So far, this is the best solution I have found.</li>
            <li> These are the best I&#x27;ve purchased thus far.</li>
            <li> I am happy to say that I will be able to wear these comfortably at night and will finally be able to save my teeth and</li>
            <li> It sure is nice not to have a pesky headache at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and the size is perfect for my mouth.</li>
            <li> I liked that it gave my mouth more space, but this made me worried that I would choke on it in the night.</li>
            <li> All in all a great, comfortable, easy to use (ie.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Suffice it to say that these work GREAT for preventing pain from bruxism (tooth grinding) &amp; I like these disposable ones a LOT better than the custom-moldable ones that, in my opinion, could never be adequately sterilized after weeks of continuous use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wear them on my lower set of teeth - very comfortable and unobtrusive, very easy to sleep in.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job of protecting teeth and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I have very strong gag reflexes so can&#x27;t wear most of the heavier thicker guards.</li>
            <li> I have been happily using them for years now at a much higher price.  </li>
            <li> When I first used this product, it worked great.</li>
            <li> The pain in my jaw was greatly reduced from the first night.</li>
            <li> price is great, much much cheaper than purchasing these at Walgreen!</li>
            <li> I might investigate other products along the way, but delighted to know this one works for me with great comfort and effectiveness!  </li>
            <li> and I expect that I will be pretty happy with these.  </li>
            <li> /grind my teeth a lot, and these are very comfortable.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great and more comfortable than most night guards, but the cheap rubber tends to cut along the roof of my mouth.</li>
            <li> very comfortable one.</li>
            <li> These guards work so well, and are very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable  to wear</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and does what it needs to do.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comfortable.</li>
            <li> , these are very comfortable.</li>
            <li> My sleep is very important.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and in good condition.</li>
            <li> They work exactly as advertised and are saving my teeth very nicely.</li>
            <li> They are very comfortable, made from a very soft and pliable material and fit my mouth perfectly.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a light grinder or clencher you might get more out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!  </li>
            <li> I like that you can wear it on your top or bottom teeth and have found it to be very comfortable.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like it, not stable, and I believe this causes me to grind more.</li>
            <li> These are so affordable and comfortable!</li>
            <li> I love these night guards.</li>
            <li> They mostly work for me.  </li>
            <li> and I dont grind my front teeth any more.  </li>
            <li> I have worn on both the top and bottom teeth.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I have dug through the trash looking for my $300 dentist guard.</li>
            <li> so it rests on top of most all of your teeth.</li>
            <li> I use them a lot longer than 3 days each more like 3 weeks each</li>
            <li> He has tried multiple mouth guards but he likes this one the best.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t love them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am able to wear them for 6-10 days before I feel that they need to be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They are more for a child&#x27;s mouth.</li>
            <li> I am hoping that with these in my mouth at night I will sleep more relaxed and stop the grinding.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They are much more comfy because of their size and you can just throw them away....</li>
            <li> This is a FANTASTIC product!  </li>
            <li> and it is more bearable.</li>
            <li> My jaw seems more aligned now with this method I&#x27;m using, plus it is inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Sooo much better than paying $400+ for a dentist&#x27;s version that lasts a year.  </li>
            <li> Also like that I can use it either on top teeth or bottom teeth.</li>
            <li> All she could say was, &amp;#34;I&#x27;m glad you&#x27;re taking care of your teeth.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sleeping more restfully because I&#x27;m not grinding anymore.</li>
            <li> (Dentek and Sleeprights being the top 2).</li>
            <li> In my usage, I&#x27;ve been able to get close to a month use out of each one, so you can use that to factor cost.</li>
            <li> Much better than the one I bought for 300 dollars from he dentist.</li>
            <li> But it feels better than my $600 retainer fro the dentist that my dog chewed</li>
            <li> I care about my teeth, but I don&#x27;t want to spend more money than I need to.  </li>
            <li> I wear them on the top teeth.</li>
            <li> Top or bottom teeth</li>
            <li> (that&#x27;s why they get chewed through and you have to replace them), so if it slips out of place when that happens I&#x27;ll just end up grinding my teeth more.  </li>
            <li> He isn&#x27;t grinding his teeth any more and also has controlled the snoring issue.</li>
            <li> I am glad I tried them, even though I did end up ruling them out for myself.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic!</li>
            <li> It has holes on top for air circulation to finish drying out the device during the day.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TBHYBHG/ref&#x3D;ox_sc_act_title_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&amp;smid&#x3D;</li>
            <li> Turns out these things work better.</li>
            <li> Perhaps you will like them better.</li>
            <li> This one size fits most product doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> one guard lasts about three or four days probably more</li>
            <li> My dentist was pleased when I told her this was the product I was using.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love these.  </li>
            <li> I am so pleased that I did.  </li>
            <li> but as most things the wear out after a year or two.  </li>
            <li> Can wear on the top or bottom teeth.  </li>
            <li> Better off w/ the dentist taylored night guard.  </li>
            <li> Chewing on it caused more jaw pain.</li>
            <li> FYI, you can use these for more that 3 nights.  </li>
            <li> This is perfect and glad I got a big pack of these</li>
            <li> I am SO glad I found these!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love these mouthguards and have use them for years.</li>
            <li> What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> amazing, and cheap.</li>
            <li> The guards do protect my teeth, but also they entice me to gnaw and clench more than I do without them.</li>
            <li> There was no way I was going to be able to wear this all night long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that they&#x27;re disposable.  </li>
            <li> love them.  </li>
            <li> I get a lot more than the instructed 3 days of usage.</li>
            <li> These have been my favorite mouth guards for years.  </li>
            <li> Am SO glad I did.</li>
            <li> I find they&#x27;re better placed on the lower teeth helping them to stay put</li>
            <li> Most I could tolerate but didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t love the idea of sleeping with plastic in my mouth,</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know of any better options</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t love the idea of sleeping with plastic in my mouth,</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know of any better options</li>
            <li> They do what they&#x27;re supposed to for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Bottom or top</li>
            <li> also advised the staff to let others know they can get a better price through Amazon</li>
            <li> My dentist probably feels better now too.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a more cost-effective alternative to a mouthguard than the bulky one I have had to get about once</li>
            <li> Love the ease of just popping it in, without having to boil to mold it.</li>
            <li> Glad to have found this product.</li>
            <li> can irritate my top lip on the inside).</li>
            <li> I would swallow it for sure.</li>
            <li> I ordered these and wore them at night and now my mouth has had a chance to heal and I&#x27;m not feeling any more pain from my root canal.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I tried for many, many nights to use this product, placing it on the bottom, on the top to no avail.</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> Most wound up smelling bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like these so much more than the guard</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the mouths guards differ in that the sample was longer and had two plastic bubbles that would keep my top and bottom teeth from touching/grinding.</li>
            <li> This made me clinch more.</li>
            <li> When I used it on my top teeth it did prevent teeth grinding on eachother but not the tension in my jaw.</li>
            <li> I wear them for more days than it stated on the instructions with no problem.</li>
            <li> I love that they are portable and I keep one in my travel bag</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure to always have one with me.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li> Love them..would order from them again</li>
            <li> So glad I tried them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kinda glad its a use and dispose model</li>
            <li> The surface area the teeth grind over is one tooth on the top, and one tooth on the bottom (both sides, of course).</li>
            <li> For sure, you should also be followed by a dentist.</li>
            <li> No need to boil and try to shape them into fitting, no looking and sounding like a</li>
            <li> and I feel much better about putting them in my mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> basically ok, but</li>
            <li> Love these things.  </li>
            <li> I get a week or more on each one.  </li>
            <li> Tried them on the top &amp; bottom, couldn&#x27;t get them to stay in place.</li>
            <li> I love the minimalist design.</li>
            <li> Great quality, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel safe sleeping with them in for fear I&#x27;d be that one in a million that chokes on it when it undoubtedly fell out of place.</li>
            <li> BTW, a pack of 14 lasted me over a year as I reuse them until they feel worn-out.:)</li>
            <li> Only used these for 2 nights, but both me and my partner agree they&#x27;re the best over the counter guards</li>
            <li> Bonus, when I wake up my jaw is more relaxed.</li>
            <li> On the bottom and top teeth of course?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found them again.</li>
            <li> You can wear it on the bottom or top teeth,</li>
            <li> Love the product and will be a lifetime user.</li>
            <li> You can use them more than once, despite what packaging says.</li>
            <li> they lose their shape the more they are used, but I use each one about five times before tossing it.</li>
            <li> They are cheap but work!</li>
            <li> They want to make a custom fitting mouth guard</li>
            <li> I also use the grinders way more than 3 nights, I just basically use them until they&#x27;re so chewed up that they don&#x27;t give any protection anymore.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many mouth guards, I lost track.  </li>
            <li> and I love them.</li>
            <li> Better than a $500 custom guard from the dentist.</li>
            <li> I have now set up regular delivery with these - they work perfectly!</li>
            <li> A wonderful product, I will definitely reorder when my 14 pack runs out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably move to a more permanent solution eventually.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I am a &amp;#34;grinder&amp;#34;; more specifically I have a front top and front bottom tooth</li>
            <li> after used it he said i&#x27;m getting MUCH better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure of it.  </li>
            <li> these magically showed up in the box.  </li>
            <li> No rhyme or reason as to why they would choose to stay put on EITHER the top or bottom.  </li>
            <li> but it is a much more affordable option for teeth grinding.</li>
            <li> Otherwise okay.</li>
            <li> It is not bulky like most of the night dental guards.</li>
            <li> -- I suspect that this product may work for folks who have more &amp;#34;average&amp;#34; mouths/teeth.</li>
            <li> Over the years I used so many of the moldable night guards that cover your front teeth that it pushed my front teeth out so that they the top teeth don&#x27;t touch my bottom teeth when I clench my teeth together.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found a substitute for my husband, so he won&#x27;t grind his teeth anymore at night.</li>
            <li> Not bulky at all, you can put it on the top or bottom teeth, I prefer the top.</li>
            <li> The clinching comes and goes for me mostly depending on my stress level</li>
            <li> Love them</li>
            <li> You can use them on top or bottom.</li>
            <li> You have to get used to them as the insert says which is ok.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> but if you clench you may want more cushion as I still wake up with a sore jaw.</li>
            <li> -- they&#x27;re more like a plastic pad over your front molars.  </li>
            <li> My teeth and mouth feel MUCH better.</li>
            <li> MY BOYFRIEND HAS BEEN ABLE TO SLEEP BETTER WITHOUT THE EFFECT OF THE GRINDING.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> You can wear them on top or the bottom</li>
            <li> but they felt better to me on the top.  </li>
            <li> Love love love these mouth</li>
            <li> love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> They do fit rather nicely.  </li>
            <li> I still wake up many times during the night and catch myself trying to grind.  </li>
            <li> I have already broke 2 teeth because of grinding and will admit it does keep my teeth from actually touching others.  </li>
            <li> feels OK to me.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s an excellent product for grinders, but definitely is not made for clenchers and ended up making my problem worse--not better.</li>
            <li> Product is OK but just does not work for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll order or buy more.</li>
            <li> Love they help with jaw fatigue.</li>
            <li> I sleep so much better now.</li>
            <li> no scraping, pinching, spit buildup-no anything just a nice piece that fit over my molars to protect against the nightly grind.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You can even wear them during the day (you can even talk while wearing it!)&lt;br /&gt;4-Can be worn on top or bottom teeth</li>
            <li> This gives more protectors, which has softer material for you to chew on.  </li>
            <li> So I guess only non-grinders with perfect teeth should use these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to give it a couple more nights and hope that it gets better.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is discrete and does not cover the front of your teeth.</li>
            <li> but I would expect better support.</li>
            <li> I do not use it every night; mostly when I am feeling a bit stressed or some times if I wake up and find that I have been clenching.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> Can be worn on top or bottom teeth.</li>
            <li> was ok</li>
            <li> and I find myself with More TMJ</li>
            <li> I place it on the top, move it to the right spot and it is good to go.  </li>
            <li> Great product and decent price.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very comfortable and easy to get used to.</li>
            <li> Very light and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> They are pretty good, it does what its supposed to.</li>
            <li> I bought these because of the reviews - they seemed pretty good.</li>
            <li> Stays pretty good in place, but after the fifth use, it tends to deform.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t inspire much confidence to look at out-of-the-box, however, remarkably they do work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not hard on my teeth because the placker was still in great shape every morning.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I found them on Amazon for the price that I used to always pay!</li>
            <li> These are great for 2-4 uses to use while I save up for a new mouth guard.  </li>
            <li> I wear them on the top and bottom depending on what I feel is most comfortable on the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but it is a good fit for us right now</li>
            <li> I order these monthly they are very comfortable for me, light and portable  stays in my mouth  until I remove</li>
            <li> I have used one more than 3 days out of necessity and it worked fine.</li>
            <li> We get about a weeks worth out of one guard and the best part is they fit our young daughter</li>
            <li> From the get-go, I already discovered it wasn&#x27;t going to fit my top teeth, so I went with the bottom.</li>
            <li> I ended up getting a custom made night guard at the dentist and have been happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> These, however, fit pretty good.</li>
            <li> SO much more comfortable than my $500 dentist-made guard.</li>
            <li> Also box claims to fit any mouth, top teeth or bottom, but it feels flimsy and impractical to keep in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Most comfortable mouth guard I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> They fit comfortably (top or bottom teeth, your choice)</li>
            <li> The fit of these mouth guards does take some getting use to, but they have helped a lot and my neck feels better every morning.</li>
            <li> Much more comfortable than a mouthguard.  </li>
            <li> These guards are comfortable and I&#x27;m able to use them 4 or 5 nights before disposing.&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li> Well because at first it felt good and comfortable in my mouth.</li>
            <li> As a retired dental hygienist, I can say these are a great alternative to a professional mouth guard if you just don&#x27;t have the funds to get one made through your dentist.  </li>
            <li> whichever you feel most comfortable.</li>
            <li> Seem to fit better if you put it on the bottom teeth.</li>
            <li> These are great for my husband, who is a LOUD grinder.</li>
            <li> Best money spent on a night guard.</li>
            <li> Way more comfortable than the one the dentist had made for 400.00.  </li>
            <li> They get the job done well but aren&#x27;t the most comfortable thing.</li>
            <li> Thanks for good product.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer observed, it&#x27;s easy to clean and seems just a durable as any comparable solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bravo!</li>
            <li> they work great except for one major flaw: you gotta remember to put it in!  </li>
            <li> guards arrived VERY quickly (2-3 days).  </li>
            <li> These are easy and convenient.</li>
            <li> They are even easy to wear and also have a conversation.  </li>
            <li> I can easily wear these all night without any problems.  </li>
            <li> If this fits your mouth, I think you&#x27;re in luck and would easily make this a 4.5 star item - otherwise keep on looking.</li>
            <li> That makes it easy to pack in my suitcase.</li>
            <li> Easy to wash, too --</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re easy to bring when</li>
            <li> I have found it most useful when I place it on my bottom teeth instead of the top.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Needless to say, I have moved on and am now using DenTek Comfort Fit NightGuard (which are \\&quot;squishy\\&quot; and adjustable along with being comfortable worn either on the top teeth or bottom)</li>
            <li> and you can easily to choke with them when you can&#x27;t control yourself.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> I thought this could be easily inserted at night as a &amp;#34;buffer&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For me, it became dislodged too easily and I felt like I could choke on it.</li>
            <li> They say disposable after 1 night, but if you rinse it with water and/or mouthwash and store it in a clean place it lasts up to 3 days, or more if you don&#x27;t use every night.</li>
            <li> easy to sleep with it in.</li>
            <li> I can use one for a couple of weeks easily, I just rinse them off in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Easily accommodates changes in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> Easy to wear no discomfort</li>
            <li> They are so easy to wear.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They&#x27;re easy to pop in</li>
            <li> This is cheaper than Target, easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The concept is good, similar to the Dentek ones except no adjustable strap to worry about not holding into place - nice slim profile.</li>
            <li> taste any strong plastic odor/taste like I read</li>
            <li> I have a strong gag reflex and they have not made me gag.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very comfortable and super easy to use.</li>
            <li> Perfect for me, easy to fit, not bulky like the other&#x27;s</li>
            <li> These fit a whole lot better than the boil kind.</li>
            <li> I find that if I warm it under a hot tap  </li>
            <li> I love these mouth guards, they are perfect for someon like me, with a small mouth.  </li>
            <li> These are fine disposable mouth guards.</li>
            <li> The device is comfortable, easy to insert and remove.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d say if you need something in a pinch they&#x27;re fine</li>
            <li> but I did fine.</li>
            <li> and I was fine.</li>
            <li> It works fine.</li>
            <li> and I find these totally fine.</li>
            <li> What lawyer doesn&#x27;t spend his/her nights clenching their jaw and grinding their teeth into a fine powder?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works fine but does fall out at night.</li>
            <li> Really easy to wear, and a fantastic value.</li>
            <li> just pop in and no boiling for fit so easy  and just brush appliance</li>
            <li> Easy to use, comfortable.  </li>
            <li> and I slept fine without it getting in the way or falling out.</li>
            <li> Comfortable, easy fit</li>
            <li> (about a month, with my usage)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to keep clean, and can easily be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They work fine, and are relatively comfortable.</li>
            <li> but they last more then 3 days each, good buy and easy to take on the road with you</li>
            <li> and it has made a huge difference in how my teeth and jaw feels in he morning.</li>
            <li> but I have because my doctor recommended them and it Made a huge difference</li>
            <li> They are light and comfortable and assuredly BPA free.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to shell out another huge amount, so I thought I would give these a try.  </li>
            <li> There was no need to go to the dentist/orthodontist to get fitted for a huge mouth guard.</li>
            <li> I had a huge headache for almost 2 days</li>
            <li> If you are thinking of trying these, my recommendation is to order their free sample here before buying:</li>
            <li> They fit me well</li>
            <li> i think they&#x27;d fit anyone.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to &amp;#34;try out the idea&amp;#34; of sleeping in a mouth guard to see if it was comfortable-</li>
            <li> They fit into your mouth with no problem and they can be worn in one of two ways.  </li>
            <li> These are comfortable and they work.</li>
            <li> They are also comfortable.</li>
            <li> I am a light sleeper, the slightest discomfort would wake me.</li>
            <li> These are comfortable and stay in all night, no problem.</li>
            <li> feels great, but stops 3/4 of the way to the back on my mouth</li>
            <li> that you either have to mold to fit your teeth or just have to deal with a mouthful of rubber and plastic parts.</li>
            <li> These plackers are  comfortable and cost is an issue.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get that part to be comfortable at all.  </li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t fit well over the front curve of your teeth.  </li>
            <li> comfortable fit and does what it is supposed to do</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find them terribly comfortable.</li>
            <li> but I found they didn&#x27;t really fit correctly.  </li>
            <li> They have saved me a lot of money, they are comfortable, and I bless the day I found  them here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re comfortable to wear, and they do not fall out.</li>
            <li> This does not feel secure in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I paid $300 for a dentist-provided custom night guard, but when I had to get a crown, it no longer fit.  </li>
            <li> I thought this product would fit comfortably.</li>
            <li> I have used and the price is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I stretch them to fit comfortably in my mouth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Plackers give protection, no soreness, doesn&#x27;t move around alot (it does move some but is not disruptive) and is unbelievably comfortable.  </li>
            <li> If anyone is in the downtown Houston area and wanting to try before buy, I have about 8 left LOL.</li>
            <li> If anyone is in the downtown Houston area and wanting to try before buy, I have about 8 left LOL.</li>
            <li> This guard is convenient because it&#x27;s disposable and it is comfortable.</li>
            <li> These stay in place just as well as the custom fit ones without all the bulk.  </li>
            <li> As others have stated these don&#x27;t fit well.</li>
            <li> Not grinding, per se, but rather a CHOMP CHOMP CHOMP sound.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable and protective.</li>
            <li> Then I tried the ones you fit yourself in boiling water, those lasted a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> They are comfortable and well packaged.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit, doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are not as comfortable as the night guard I had</li>
            <li> DoctorS Nightguard Advanced Comfort Box]]</li>
            <li> I find that this kind of \\&quot;stretch\\&quot; relaxes my jaw, and makes me not clench as much.</li>
            <li> I find that this kind of \\&quot;stretch\\&quot; relaxes my jaw, and makes me not clench as much.</li>
            <li> I suspect, too, but it&#x27;s never been confirmed.</li>
            <li> They are comfortable.</li>
            <li> These fit snugly in my mouth and prevent me from grinding my teeth together at night.  </li>
            <li> As a person who has a great deal of dental work, the regular \\&quot;boil and mold\\&quot; night guards are out of the question.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the fit, and they are cheap enough I do not get upset when the dog gets ahold of one and chews it up.</li>
            <li> They work, keeping my teeth from grinding together, but they&#x27;re not as comfortable as fitted guards because they tend to move around within my mouth a lot.</li>
            <li> guard takes a couple of nights to get used to and is secure and relatively comfortable.  </li>
            <li> visited plackers.com and noticed an offer for a \\&quot;free sample\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I have only used the guards for two nights and I am happy to report NO headaches and No tooth aches.  </li>
            <li> They fit well and don&#x27;t hinder my sleep.</li>
            <li> They are comfortable, and I haven&#x27;t choked on them or died, so that&#x27;s a plus.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know who would feel comfortable wearing this all night.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll continue with the Plackers Grind-no-MOre for the foreseeable and grateful to have found something that&#x27;s comfortable and works.</li>
            <li> The price is cheap also.</li>
            <li> This has been great, keeps my back teeth apart, I believe.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and they are custom fit.</li>
            <li> Versatile fit and not bulky in the mouth.</li>
            <li> It is so comfortable to wear and does not hurt my mouth.</li>
            <li> They are comfortable but I perfer the lower jaw fit.</li>
            <li> And even with that, the design of these don&#x27;t make for them to fit conveniently.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really fit my mouth</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my mouth and fell out during sleep.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t fit</li>
            <li> In the mouth, it didn&#x27;t fit quite well and it was floating around</li>
            <li> They are comfortable and don&#x27;t affect your speech.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re comfortable and disposable.</li>
            <li> Great guards for daily use</li>
            <li> Great product and only one</li>
            <li> This device is comfortable and seems to have solved my clenching problem.</li>
            <li> Hubby says they are as comfortable to him as the others...</li>
            <li> Weren&#x27;t comfortable.  </li>
            <li> The Doctor&#x27;s NightGuard Advanced Comfort Dental Protector for Teeth Grinding, 1 pack]].</li>
            <li> Some of them are not even &amp;#34;squared&amp;#34; to fit in your mouth… unless my jaw has become &amp;#34;un-squared&amp;#34; which I guess is a possibility.  </li>
            <li> Fit comfortably in the mouth.  </li>
            <li> My dentist told me there was evidence I was grinding my teeth and offered to sell me a custom fit guard.</li>
            <li> boiling (unlike the $30 mouthpieces that you wind up throwing away because they don&#x27;t fit</li>
            <li> Light and comfortable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this item feels comfortable</li>
            <li> They are easy to clean (rinse in water or soak in mouth wash).  </li>
            <li> I can sleep comfortably with one in.</li>
            <li> they are comfortable and don&#x27;t interfere with my oxygen at all.</li>
            <li> Light weight and who cares if you lose it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t really a cheap option if used as directed - 1 mouth guard every 3 days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To enjoy it even more, I spread tasty Fun Dip powder on the mouth guard before bed each night.  </li>
            <li> I bought these for my 13 yr old son and they work good to prevent his grinding.  </li>
            <li> I was self conscious with this thing in my mouth and didn&#x27;t get a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li> They last for more than 3 days which makes them a good deal.  </li>
            <li> the Good thing about these is that you can wear them during the day (say while driving) and speak  clearly and even sip coffee</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised at how good they work.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fit right and the material makes me want to chew more.</li>
            <li> but it will cost many hundreds of dollars which we just don&#x27;t have right now and is not covered by insurance.</li>
            <li> i was all happy and excited to finally have found a solution to my grinding.</li>
            <li> Certainly much cheaper than having the dentist composing an appliance for your teeth!!!</li>
            <li> Very useful considering the cost and what would have cost if one is to go through the hassle of claiming one through insurance.</li>
            <li> These are comfortable and do the job adequately and if the dog gets it, it&#x27;s easily replaced with another without hurting your pocketbook.  </li>
            <li> I wear them under my top teeth for a more comfortable fit, but they are just the most amazing little things.</li>
            <li> I have an average/ small mouth and it fit me perfect.</li>
            <li> My mouth is quite small and these fit the best and</li>
            <li> In fairness to the SleepRight guard, which is my second favorite, the SleepRight does feel more \\&quot;secure\\&quot; and more cushioned, if that is important to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quick and easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t sure this would work since i typically wear the acrylic one from my dentist, but it&#x27;s great for weekend trips.</li>
            <li> I found them at our local drug store and tried them and they are amazing!</li>
            <li> Best part is because they are so small, they won&#x27;t ruin your sex life.</li>
            <li> I wore one for the first time last night and was sort of impressed at first...</li>
            <li> Once you try them and want more, look into the auto delivery program through Amazon and cross one more thing off your list of things to worry about!  </li>
            <li> I am glad so many others have found these night guards useful, but for me, not so much.</li>
            <li> I love that my husband doesn&#x27;t have some gross discolored mouth guard sitting by the sink all the time any more!</li>
            <li> Worth the money, without a doubt!</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s slim, I do not experience any significant change in my bite pattern either, which can be a problem with over the counter mouth guards.</li>
            <li> Those guys are extremely familiar with any TMJ disorder.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can use it more than the three recommended times, which manufacturer says just to make you keep buying more, but it actually can be used more times, if you care to keep it antiseptically stored.</li>
            <li> When I originally found these at the dollar store I had to try.</li>
            <li> I was in love the first night.</li>
            <li> Those moldable mouth guards, sure, you can get them hot</li>
            <li> I can feel how they could alter your bite if you used them long term, but for me these are a great solution.</li>
            <li> I love waking up without headaches and they&#x27;re pretty inexpensive for walking up</li>
            <li> Grind no more is the best ones I have ever found.</li>
            <li> After using Plackers Mouth Guard for several months, I have to say it&#x27;s the best in the market as far as I know!</li>
            <li> The guard fits pretty well and doesn&#x27;t slip, over all I&#x27;d say that I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> These are much more comfortable than the large over the counter ones that are dropped&lt;br /&gt;in boiling water</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that you can have a new pair when needed.</li>
            <li> Very cheap in large quantities.</li>
            <li> I like these because I don&#x27;t have to continuously clean the mouthguard.</li>
            <li> These are much easier and more comfortable to wear at night.  </li>
            <li> Plackers are super sleek and light.</li>
            <li> Compared to the self molded athletic style guards, there are no irregular bite marks to clean.</li>
            <li> The Plackers guard is also easier to clean than the SleepRight guard.</li>
            <li> Ironically, the Plackers \\&quot;disposable\\&quot; guards are the easiest to clean and keep using!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I change out just to be clean.</li>
            <li> I clean it every morning</li>
            <li> Kind of magical actually.  </li>
            <li> Clean when you wake up</li>
            <li> a dentist &amp; PLACKERS is even better than several custom guards I own.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good product, much smaller and more confortable than the boil and mold type of mouth guard.</li>
            <li> These are OK for the first night, but they quickly wear out.</li>
            <li> We have 3 dogs, who love to find them, so he goes through them pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> They are comfortable, Not bulky like professional dentist, I can get a new clean one every couple of days, great for travel...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed they are very particular about not using it for more than 3 days as I assume it starts disintegrating at a non-visible level.</li>
            <li> (My Dad got one specially made, and he can&#x27;t close his mouth all the way when he wears it.</li>
            <li> works as expected great price.</li>
            <li> They really work as well, maybe better than, my $600 mouthguard from the dentist (which broke).</li>
            <li> Product is good but definitely consult doctor before use.</li>
            <li> This seems like a good idea because it creates a gap between all of your teeth without needing to actually cover them all, but that isn&#x27;t the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought these looked like a good option because they didn&#x27;t have to be molded to your mouth, but the only thing holding them in place is me gritting my teeth.  </li>
            <li> This is good for people who grind occasionally when stressed (like me).</li>
            <li> For me these would be a good back up</li>
            <li> These things last me a good month for each Mouth Peice.</li>
            <li> - I realized that this is from this thing and trying to find the sweet spot that it would sit well</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who appreciates top quality at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> While it isn&#x27;t totally comfortable, it is far more comfortable than others I have tried.</li>
            <li> I thought these were full mouth piece.</li>
            <li> and they fit fun.  </li>
            <li> I have tried the full mouth ones and could not keep them in my mouth.</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t been able to find these reasonably priced mouth guards.  </li>
            <li> You would be better off getting a real mouth guard.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing against the seller...</li>
            <li> Those work very well for a month or 2 and cost a LOT more.</li>
            <li> You can wear them above your top (I prefer) or bottom teeth as is more comfortable.</li>
            <li> My dentist thought they were so cool.</li>
            <li> I think this length is more ideal than reaching all the way to the back, just personal preference and how my teeth are lined up.</li>
            <li> I love that they don&#x27;t take up your whole mouth.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit right.  </li>
            <li> I have used a variety of mouth guards to fight my bruxism, I like this one the best because it fits only on the back teeth, rinses clean, and this supply lasts me forever.</li>
            <li> may not fit perfectly, but I did find that I developed this habit of kind of \\&quot;sucking\\&quot; it into place, and now the size doesn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
            <li> After buying large, bulky mouth guards for a few years, these are a welcome change!  </li>
            <li> After reading so many positive reviews on here about these night protectors, I was pretty excited to try them out.  </li>
            <li> I have not used any other brand of night guards, but I haven&#x27;t had to because these are great.  </li>
            <li> The idea of the Plackers Mouth Guard Is a good one, a small, unobtrusive, disposable guard that can universally fit anyone with none of the boiling, cleaning and fitting.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use them for my everynight guard, but they&#x27;re great to have on hand for the times I forget to pack my other.</li>
            <li> These on the other hand are great</li>
            <li> This product was great for me while I decided what other semi-permanent solution I should use.</li>
            <li> These are perfect - very small &amp; non-intrusive.  </li>
            <li> The material is nice and squishy, which provides a good cushion instead of the really hard dentist made night protector.</li>
            <li> so it covers most all the top of my teeth, so they are lasting longer</li>
            <li> Jaw clicking and mild pain.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have to get something more solid with more coverage.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re far more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Plus the insides of my cheeks got quickly torn up.</li>
            <li> I was quick to buy these thinking</li>
            <li> but I think it is the best value for those of us who may forget or lose more expensive products.</li>
            <li> Every morning I brush it well and give it a quick splash of my mouthwash.</li>
            <li> They arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.  </li>
            <li> They are super flimsy.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this, I won&#x27;t be trying any others out. :)</li>
            <li> I have been using these for several years and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I started grinding my teeth at night and tried a cheap solution first.  </li>
            <li> Bottom is a bit more comfortable but they still do not stay in my mouth at night or feel like they fit properly.  </li>
            <li> I used the other highly-rated dental guards on Amazon (sleepright etc.) but switched to this because of good ratings and cheap cost.</li>
            <li> I rinse them in very hot water each morning.  </li>
            <li> and I had no fear of accidentally swallowing one; they fit securely and definitely provide a sufficient cushioning pad between top &amp; bottom molars.  </li>
            <li> Based on other reviews, I decided to give this one a try, and it is by far is the BEST I have come across.</li>
            <li> Just like a Pro unit, you will salivate more than normal, however that will subside.  </li>
            <li> It was my first time that I used guard , I feel comfortable at all.</li>
            <li> Being that they&#x27;re pretty cheap and disposable</li>
            <li> Am very glad I read others reviews and ultimately purchased these for myself.</li>
            <li> As others have noted, these are comfortable, affordable, sanitary, and absolutely do the job!  </li>
            <li> I only use these when I am stressed and can feel that I will have a grind my teeth kind of night and that is why I choose disposable because then I don&#x27;t have to store and clean anything.  </li>
            <li> I have found that if you clean and dry them each morning they are good for far more than 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can see why though since the new guards are much more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m OK with these until I can afford a new molded night&lt;br /&gt;guard.</li>
            <li> These were great, first off my teeth are not straight</li>
            <li> Put it on my bottom teeth first, but that hurt my gum in front too much, so I switched to the top.  </li>
            <li> These mouth guards are very descrete and easy to wear.</li>
            <li> These are very convenient and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> (I just replaced my first one after a month!</li>
            <li> I love how small they are and if it gets flung across the room and lost it is ok since there are so many in a pkg.</li>
            <li> A special thanks to mans best friend for finally eating my regular mouth guard.  </li>
            <li> It took a little while to get used to, but they work great for me.</li>
            <li> These guards are comfortable and protect all my teeth very well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to be able to toss one out and have a fresh way every few weeks.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product and they&#x27;re very affordable.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re comfortable, inexpensive, very unobtrusive and lightweight.  </li>
            <li> Further, the place where the plastic rests between the teeth is halfway to the rear of the mouth which has proven, for me anyway, to be much more comfortable than the Sleepright.</li>
            <li> They are more comfortable than some mouth guards -- and smaller -- but they still bugged me.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a professional mouth guard and have been using these for a while now and love them.</li>
            <li> and these are by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> obviously because crowns yield a tidy profit).  </li>
            <li> Use them 3-4 nights then get a fresh one.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that I can get a fresh mouth guard every week.</li>
            <li> they are ok, they didn&#x27;t fit my mouth well enough to survive the night without falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li> When they do last though they might last for four days and are wonderful and bring much needed relief and help me avoid morning headaches that comes from teeth grinding.</li>
            <li> If you do suffer from clinching or grinding they are worth a try.</li>
            <li> It can be placed on either upper or lower teeth, whichever is more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s 1.20 or per piece, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> wait to do this - it is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> but this is rare.</li>
            <li> A custom fitted mouth piece is worth the peace of mind.</li>
            <li> Because it is made of soft rubber I have found myself tending to chew it more than what I do with the rigid protector I got from my dentist.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a heavy grinder, so I&#x27;m sure that aids in the extend use.</li>
            <li> He like them even better than his professional one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had top soft plastic pieces.  </li>
            <li> Then, when I blew about a $100 on South Park DVD&#x27;s (well worth every penny)</li>
            <li> The design is very simple but also effective.</li>
            <li> However, they recommend you use these only once and then discard, which is kind of overkill.  </li>
            <li> Since these are MUCH MUCH more comfortable I actually use them.</li>
            <li> These are an economical way to keep a &#x27;fresh&#x27; mouthguard on hand all the time.</li>
            <li> It spreads your upper and lower jaw by a minute amount, effectively preventing contact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tried a couple others purchased through drug store, the type you soaked in warm water and molded to your upper teeth.  </li>
            <li> Open the individual packs, tested it under my top teeth, flipped it over onto my bottom teeth because it was more comfortable and voila!</li>
            <li> For the price you pay, I guess plackers are worth it.</li>
            <li> You get your money&#x27;s worth with the plackers mouth guard.</li>
            <li> No such issues here - they&#x27;re inexpensive and quite effective.</li>
            <li> You can talk and smile and it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;Great for travel.</li>
            <li> Better priced as other mouth guards, with better protection, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> these made me grind more, not less.  </li>
            <li> As long as I leave it loose, it works great!</li>
            <li> Definitely can use each for many nights; just a matter of keeping it clean and not losing it.</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive at first, but I&#x27;ve been using these for a couple months now and they are great.  </li>
            <li> No longer available at the dollar store, so I went to Amazon, and glad to find a bigger box of the exact product.</li>
            <li> I bit right thru these.</li>
            <li> Sleep Right</li>
            <li> The mouth guard does not stay in the right spot.</li>
            <li> I could tell right away that it wouldn&#x27;t stay in my mouth at night.</li>
            <li> right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and right.  </li>
            <li> right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and right.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I used it for the right reasons, but</li>
            <li> You stop clenching your teeth together) the darn thing falls out into your throat or right out of your mouth.</li>
            <li> For me, they work just right.</li>
            <li> did right chioce.</li>
            <li> Granted, with my breath right strip and the teeth protector</li>
            <li> Easy to take on travel or vacation, just throw them out, use a new one.</li>
            <li> My husband (normal-sized mouth kind of guy) tried it and had exactly the same issues.</li>
            <li> These are thin, flexible, and can be worn on top or bottom - which is so nice!  </li>
            <li> Plus I&#x27;m still not entirely sure what kind of bacteria will accumulate with using it more than 3 nights in a row.</li>
            <li> It would explain tired/aching jaws and headaches in the morning, but insurance wouldn&#x27;t cover it and I wasn&#x27;t willing to spend the full amount without trying some over the counter solutions first.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re ok, but I seem to chomp down more often when I use them during the day.  </li>
            <li> Also, the coverage isn&#x27;t great -- these won&#x27;t help so much if you primarily grind your front teeth, since they only cover your back molars.</li>
            <li> It really does help with grinding, though each one isn&#x27;t good for very long.</li>
            <li> These mouth guards do okay, but the Dental Guard I previously bought was better.</li>
            <li> I seriously never expected to find so many benefits in a mouthguard, these are a lifesaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is great because it is small.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d say these are not only more comfortable they are much cheaper.</li>
            <li> but they are small and great for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think that will depend on what kind of grinding issue you have, whether you&#x27;re biting or basically eating the thing all night long.</li>
            <li> no bad cheaper than the real deal ..</li>
            <li> The thing I really love about these mouthguards is that they are disposable and therefore I am able to have a new mouthguard much more often then the more expensive longer-lasting mouthguards.</li>
            <li> Granted, he&#x27;s the only man-study in my lab right now, but I am so happy I get to sleep through the night uninterrupted again!!  </li>
            <li> I feel if it was a little more form fitting it would work.  </li>
            <li> So far so good, I&#x27;m like them, no more grinding easy to clean</li>
            <li> I got these because my dentist made night guard doesn&#x27;t fit anymore because of a new crown.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t use them after the first night and returned them right away.</li>
            <li> These are lightweight and so much more comfortable and easy to clean than the heavy old plastic guards made by dentists</li>
            <li> No More guards are sturdy, but not uncomfortable and provide great support for grinders like me.</li>
            <li> These are super helpful and very convenient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different types, but these work the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since found others with a similarly flexible fit that are BPA free</li>
            <li> I tried a few different grind guards and this was the best.</li>
            <li> They are so small and still very effective.</li>
            <li> Most of the reviews were great, especially for people with a small mouths, except 1 person.</li>
            <li> They fit more comfortably and I can usually use one for 3 days.</li>
            <li> The guard works for mild teeth grinding an does not irritate the soft tissues of the mouth the way a full mouth guard can.</li>
            <li> But the plastic distorts very fast..</li>
            <li> I found these years ago at CVS for a very reasonable price</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are super soft, clean up with a simple rinse and are usable for a week or more</li>
            <li> Very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> If you wonder whether a bite guard will help you, this is a very reasonable priced item and makes either a low-cost experiment or for permanent use.</li>
            <li> This one is very comfortable and not too big for my mouth.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, VERY comfortable, actually works, AND</li>
            <li> Tldr; This brand does not provide very much protection for us chronic grinders</li>
            <li> These grind no more dental night protectors work better, are more convenient to use, and are more economical than the custom protectors that my dentist fabricated.</li>
            <li> They are much more comfortable than other mouth guards I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I use them far longer than the package says, and they hold up fine.  </li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t the most comfortable things in the world but they don&#x27;t cut my mouth from being too sharp and it&#x27;s bearable enough for me to be able to sleep.</li>
            <li> after one night of use, i woke up without a headache for the first time in months.  </li>
            <li> and I think that is what causes most of the problems with regular mouth guards.</li>
            <li> These hold up pretty well on night gnashing.</li>
            <li> These are great and very inexpensive compared to similar guards you can buy in bigger stores.</li>
            <li> [...] It definitely seems like a hit-or-miss sort of thing, like with many \\&quot;one size fits all\\&quot; products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the mouthpiece-like night guard, and the more expensive lasts-for-months version of this night guard (the one with the adjustable size), and have come back to these Plackers as being the best of the lot.  </li>
            <li> but my first night i slept so well!&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are soft from the package and you don&#x27;t need to boil them to fit in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Too much STRESS!  </li>
            <li> I use them with the top on the upper row of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> A night guard that covers all of the upper or lower teeth is a much better investment than this product.  </li>
            <li> Most likely won&#x27;t buy again, unless my son decides he likes them.</li>
            <li> I tried both top and bottom teeth and the same thing happened: the guard moved and slid all over the place.</li>
            <li> We both tried to wear it on the top and bottom teeth with the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Multiple attempts to get a better placement were fruitless.  </li>
            <li> This is my first teeth guard</li>
            <li> I think, which was why I got them in the first place.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that they are I individually packaged.</li>
            <li> They are also pretty darn sturdy.</li>
            <li> The price is pretty close to what I have seen elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it&#x27;s not one size fits all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, it is the most simple.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the first guard for two weeks now</li>
            <li> A much needed, well-designed product!</li>
            <li> years ago a program on Netflix was a documentary of travel in places where most of the population has never seen a person from civilization.</li>
            <li> This item is exactly what my  husband needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m most pleased at how small this guard fits in my mouth.</li>
            <li> These work very well!</li>
            <li> No More guards are awesome because they are sort of like daily contacts.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed is that I stopped having headaches.</li>
            <li> to durability I am still using the first one I tried.</li>
            <li> I first used them I would have dreams I was eating things which when I&#x27;d wake up I&#x27;d realize was me chewing on the guard.  </li>
            <li> I would say that my jaw pain has been so reduced  that I am rarely aware of the discomfort that I had before I began using this product.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t wearing it at first.</li>
            <li> I felt like my bite was off when I would first wake up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been rinsing it every morning, airing it out on my nightstand, and make sure my teeth are brushed before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> I love how you can switch it from the upper to the lower teeth, too.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite guards and when I could no longer find them at my local drug store, I searched here.</li>
            <li> Ok, having suffered from bruxism (teeth grinding) nightly, for several years, was told to get something to wear at night by my dentist.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not bulky either, so you&#x27;re more likely to wear it at night.</li>
            <li> Will definitely continue to use them and they are more affordable than the almost $700 for a custom fitted one from the dentist.</li>
            <li> but I use &#x27;em for a month to 6 weeks with no ill effects.  </li>
            <li> You get a sore throat from breathing with your mouth open all nite long...found better mouthguard than these on line</li>
            <li> I quickly go back to not clenching and this process seems to irritate my jaw more by the time I wake up.  </li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li> and they work pretty well.</li>
            <li> 14 was more than enough.  </li>
            <li> I decided to be a big girl and try it again, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> And it definitely covers a lot more tooth than the super-expensive \\&quot;professional\\&quot; ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it definitely covers a lot more tooth than the super-expensive \\&quot;professional\\&quot; ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only that but setting up a subscription with them, I don&#x27;t have to worry about not being able to find them when I run out.</li>
            <li> These are a TERRIFIC, more hygienic alternative to custom-molded mouthpieces for overnight use for defeating bruxism.  </li>
            <li> I ,do it consistently.</li>
            <li> My first pack lasted me a year.</li>
            <li> These seem like the best deal to me, as I only use a guard occasionally and they can be used multiple times each.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely order more.</li>
            <li> I tried a bulkier mouth guard first</li>
            <li> After I tried them out for the first time, I knew I would buy them again.  </li>
            <li> To me, this is much more hygienic than using the same mouth guard for months at a time.  </li>
            <li> The material is comfortable and soft.  </li>
            <li> This is my first mouth guard</li>
            <li> Does seem to put more pressure in a smaller area though.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I did try the full mouth guard type and just couldn&#x27;t get it to fit properly.</li>
            <li> This product helped me so much!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using my first one and it has been a month.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!  </li>
            <li> Personally, I would look into a more durable product.</li>
            <li> Wearing this actually made me clinch more which inflamed my jaw muscles.</li>
            <li> I have used mouth guards for years but recently lost two to my favorite dog.  </li>
            <li> and I did not think these very slim mouth guards would work, but they did!</li>
            <li> first glance, these look like you would choke on them and die.  </li>
            <li> I then put it on the upper teeth and it felt okay.  </li>
            <li> My first mouth guard is going on 2 months with no signs of wear or discoloration.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> It works, but,.....not a natural fit on the front teeth and gums....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried more expensive ones and different types and decided on these as the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid big money for custom mouth guards and none of them proved to be better than these.</li>
            <li> First of all, a mouth guard isn&#x27;t going to get you to stop grinding.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t give the same protection level, but some is better than none</li>
            <li> I actually like these bite guards better.</li>
            <li> This is the first night guard I&#x27;ve used that worked for me.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;d more likely fall out if it became that dislodged.  </li>
            <li> so if it does happen you most likely will wake up and put it</li>
            <li> I also have a small mouth, so those &amp;#34;boil to fit perfectly&amp;#34; kind don&#x27;t work...</li>
            <li> Went back to see the dentist with more pain</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t last more than an hour before I took them out.</li>
            <li> well it will only get better as I continue to get used to the feeling.</li>
            <li> The guard was so big that the front connector didn&#x27;t even come close to touching my gums.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> I can usually get about a good weeks worth of use from one pair, but still, I like how they perform.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty</li>
            <li> I have used one guard for several weeks or more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I discovered these at CVS a few years ago &amp; immediately LOVED them &amp; sleep with them nightly.  </li>
            <li> These were never remotely comfortable, and I gave them a good chance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few mouth guards before without problem, but thought I&#x27;d give these a try since they&#x27;re compact and would be good for travel.</li>
            <li> If you have any teeth missing at all, this would not be a good one for you.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They&#x27;re small but adequate for most people, I would think, unless you have a huge jaw.</li>
            <li> I found that these work better than the alternatives because they are thinner and a slimmer, less intrusive fit.</li>
            <li> It stays in my mouth all night and is very comfortable...plus the price is right.</li>
            <li> This, in rare occasions, may cause sensitivity of those individual teeth because the load is not spread over more teeth (like a normal bite).</li>
            <li> All the other mouth guard products I&#x27;ve tried haven&#x27;t even come close to doing the kind of thorough job that this product does 24/7.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried pretty much every night guard on the market and this one ranks roughly in 3rd of my top 3</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that all night guards will eventually need replacing, and if you try it and like it, it may turn out to be a cost effective solution for your nighttime grinding compared to other night guards.</li>
            <li> They are super comfortable &amp; last MUCH longer than the recommended 3 days for me.  </li>
            <li> I am devastated to have lost it and will most likely replace it before wasting too much money on these poorly-made stop-gap solutions.</li>
            <li> And I am able to make one last a whole week.  </li>
            <li> Good alternative to the more expensive options.</li>
            <li> think my custom guard actually encouraged me to grind even more b/c it provided so much</li>
            <li> If you have a large mouth it may not work for you because I bought my first box for my husband and I to both try as we are both nighttime teeth</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;d recommend these if you are POSITIVE</li>
            <li> this worked really well when i first started using it now</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t seem to stop them, and just because my 2 and 3 year old don&#x27;t realize that its gross, I like to get a fresh one after they&#x27;ve had it:)</li>
            <li> but i question how long we can use it safely in the mouth without any repercussions.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s better than having messed up teeth over the long run.</li>
            <li> Much more economical and hygienic than other brands.</li>
            <li> and so my teeth pretty much stay together through the night.</li>
            <li> Comfortable, barely there feel,</li>
            <li> Small, perfect fit even for small mouths.</li>
            <li> Good for small mouth.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft and pliable so they don&#x27;t hurt your gum line or jaw after a full night of grinding.</li>
            <li> I might have TMJ (which they said isn&#x27;t a good mix with these), so that might be the cause, but I&#x27;m not totally sure.  </li>
            <li> Picked it because it had some of the best reviews but stopped using it because it comes loose very easily and might be a choking hazard due to its small size.  </li>
            <li> You can use them for several nights in a row, but I recommend rinsing them every morning and before bed to keep them clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> These are better in one regard to some night guards as they only have pieces that contact your back teeth where most of the grinding action takes place.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well these work and think they are more comfortable than the other types I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other night guards and these are by far the most comfortable and easiest to keep in all night.</li>
            <li> For the past 3-4 years I&#x27;ve been using the Sleepright Secure Comfort Dental Guard which worked OK</li>
            <li> Also, no more jaw pain, they are more comfortable than anything else I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Easy to wear, not bulky like a mouth guard; only covers what needs to be covered.</li>
            <li> I was clenching my teeth and causing fractures that made my teeth super temperature sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Easy to travel with and each one last me a week.</li>
            <li> Its nice because they are not super bulky and there is no boiling and risking burning your mouth.</li>
            <li> I also have an easy gag reflex, this one is the only one of those I tried that did not make me gag.</li>
            <li> It certainly doesn&#x27;t take the place of the non-disposable, moldable solution.</li>
            <li> Got smart and bought these.</li>
            <li> I certainly like the disposable, easy-use aspect.</li>
            <li> I certainly use them for about 7 days each, and don&#x27;t just toss them after 3 nights.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I had two large sores where the sides of the guard broke in the sides of my mouth.</li>
            <li> I have always suffered from bruxism but the nightguards are too large.  </li>
            <li> I really like these because they fit around my retainer, they&#x27;re small and flexible and you can wear them on the top or bottom.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really loose fitting piece of plastic.  </li>
            <li> It was heard to clean, and never really felt completely clean.</li>
            <li> I wear mine facing down, but it is possible to wear them on your top teeth as well if you find it more to your liking.&lt;br</li>
            <li> brand is fantastic and after using for a year I have only seen positive outcomes.  </li>
            <li> Really a top notch product, they are tiny but you will be surprised how well they work!</li>
            <li> This is also cheap enough that tossing the guards after 3 nights is realistic ensuring a clean fresh guard that hasn&#x27;t been chewed or ground to half its original height.</li>
            <li> Initially I had one from the dentist, but I lost it and started to use the Dentek custom comfort, which do work but are too large for me to wear comfortably.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to keep clean, and after the plastic starts feeling a little iffy, I just replace it.  </li>
            <li> Lightweight, fits good in my small mouth, let&#x27;s me breathe easily unlike the single mouthpiece</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, it is the least bulky and most comfortable.</li>
            <li> They really helped me overcome some very severe jaw pain--I don&#x27;t think I could have slept through the night without them; highly recommended!</li>
            <li> and I liked it except that it&#x27;s much more expensive.  </li>
            <li> really keeps my son and I from grinding our teeth at night</li>
            <li> also use them for much longer than the 3 days or whatever you&#x27;re supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I really like theses mouth guards because I don&#x27;t have to spend a fortune at the dentist.</li>
            <li> and it was very helpful.</li>
            <li> There is no way.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re also much cheaper than getting one form the dentist.</li>
            <li> Sometimes causes too much movement</li>
            <li> My jaw joint would hurt too much because it got hyper-extended.  </li>
            <li> These really save my teeth</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t grind my teeth, so I can&#x27;t really speak to that issue.</li>
            <li> I had no idea how much tension</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth at night and these really work.</li>
            <li> These night guards really do work.  </li>
            <li> My custom made night guard met an untimely death, thanks to my dog.</li>
            <li> but it will not be ready for two weeks</li>
            <li> This product not being adjustable also comes at a cost... if your mouth doesn&#x27;t fit it, move on to the next one.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like these.</li>
            <li> I am a bruxor and these really keep me from grinding my teeth.</li>
            <li> When I wake up for the first 10-15 minutes of the day my bite is no longer aligned like normal.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Much cheaper to purchase via amazon than at CVS-type store.</li>
            <li> I really like these.</li>
            <li> it gets more compressed and moves move, possibly slipping off while sleeping.</li>
            <li> (i&#x27;m wearing them on the top) and are showing minimal if any wear  after three days.</li>
            <li> , you get a bunch in the package and they don&#x27;t cost too much.</li>
            <li> This one comes already shaped and it fits comfortable on both upper or lower teeth.</li>
            <li> , that was the part that really bothered me.  </li>
            <li> gave this two stars instead of one just because the middle that holds your teeth apart was fairly comfortable.  </li>
            <li> In practice though, it doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> Nobody wants to look odd.&lt;br /&gt;Ten</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> There seems to be a real concern of accidentally swallowing these.</li>
            <li> Found that it&#x27;s much cheaper to buy them here.</li>
            <li> Basically the whole family wears these now.</li>
            <li> Never realized how much I grind my teeth.</li>
            <li> It really works.  </li>
            <li> my jaw muscles felt very sore</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been quoted as much as $900 for a mouth guard which is basically a scam as is there is no cure for TMJ.</li>
            <li> only concern is if the materials are &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; (e.g. BPA free...)</li>
            <li> I have rheumatoid arthritis and my TMJ is very severe.</li>
            <li> I really like these night guards.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> mouth guard from dentist cracked  last winter it was never as comfortable as these are  /</li>
            <li> I have tried the big, boil and fit mouth guards and the never are in my mouth when I wake up.  </li>
            <li> And over time it turns out this was really happening</li>
            <li> I have found that isn&#x27;t really an issue.  </li>
            <li> They are slim but really do the job.</li>
            <li> Very well constructed and aesthetically pleasing.</li>
            <li> but my grinding is so intense it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I found that I still had teeth contact because this product does not cover the majority of the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now using the \\&quot;Doctor&#x27;s\\&quot; guard and it works much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really grind, I clench, and I also have invisalign, so</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Each one lasts about 3 weeks for me, and they&#x27;re very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much nicer</li>
            <li> Said it would fit upper or lower and I need for lower and it won&#x27;t stay in place.</li>
            <li> and then I&#x27;m ready to throw them away.</li>
            <li> These are really helpful.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even realize I was clenching my teeth until I had a root canal and was experiencing so much pain after from clenching my teeth at night after the procedure.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s looking very promiseing.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work very well for me.</li>
            <li> These really work well.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m really worried about one thing with these.</li>
            <li> So my bite feels really off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I dont really have a problem except</li>
            <li> They are very flimsy and have nothing to hold them to your teeth.</li>
            <li> They fit well either on my upper or lower teeth</li>
            <li> I love that they are soft enough to be comfortable but durable enough to withstand my grinding.</li>
            <li> They are slim and flexible so you can still close your mouth, and they are really unnoticeable once you have them in.  </li>
            <li> They really do the trick for grinding teeth.  </li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t say.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t fit despite trimming and instantly made me gag,</li>
            <li> guards are extremely comfortable,  enabling me to wear them on the upper or lower teeth.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper on line than in the store.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Wound up just going to the dentist and getting a real night guard.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> I sleep well because you don&#x27;t feel these in your mouth as much as others.</li>
            <li> Before I used them, my mouth would hurt so much, that at times I would scream until some a killers started to work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable enough....</li>
            <li> I am really grateful for these.</li>
            <li> and it has absolutely cured my TMJ is a front teeth appliance from chairsidesplint.com.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to pay $500 for the whole mouth guard.  </li>
            <li> Convenient and much cheaper than ones from the dentist.</li>
            <li> but they really help with tooth grinding.</li>
            <li> They really help my wife sleep beter and wake up without jaw pain.</li>
            <li> These disposable mouth guards work very well and stay in place without being obtrusive</li>
            <li> (drove 21 hours straight from Fort Myers to Milwaukee</li>
            <li> so have a glass of water ready.</li>
            <li> Not only do they change the way your teeth fit together</li>
            <li> Cheap enough to throw out after  week&#x27;s use.  </li>
            <li> I really like these mouth guards</li>
            <li> These are simple, comfortable, and disposable.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I will chew them to the point of bleeding, so needed to figure out something to do about it and fast.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really found anything I do not like about them.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s \\&quot;disposable\\&quot;, the plastic is not thin</li>
            <li> The Grind-No-More night protector works very well for me.</li>
            <li> I tried it and really think it helped.  </li>
            <li> These really help with daytime and nighttime grinding.</li>
            <li> After my insurance company declined me for a real mouth guard, I decided to give these a shot.</li>
            <li> Very affordable and very affective.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> This really works and does not bother me a bit while I&#x27;m sleeping.</li>
            <li> and they whole nine yards.</li>
            <li> They should really state in the advertising that this product is NOT ADVISED if you have TMJ.</li>
            <li> but I really like them now.  </li>
            <li> I purchased these because I absolutely did not want to spend $600 on a night guard/bite splint that was offered to me at the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t bother me too much while I sleep.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> plus it&#x27;s flexible enough to fit my wider jaw.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone with this intense problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pros: no boiling, reasonable price, works/</li>
            <li> :  Before I go to sleep, I lower my jaw as much as possible, and then kind of wiggle it left</li>
            <li> :  Before I go to sleep, I lower my jaw as much as possible, and then kind of wiggle it left</li>
            <li> They have an extremely minimal form that makes wearing them not awkward at all, and they are a hardy plastic that feels comfortable in the mouth.</li>
            <li> use this product at night and take Buddha&#x27;s Herbs Optimum Glucosamine / Chondroitin / MSM Complex.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen some people complain that these are too small for their mouth, but if you read the instructions, that&#x27;s fine, and from experience I can tell you that the size is fine.</li>
            <li> Grind no more are comfortable, allow you to breath and speak easily.  </li>
            <li> The way these are made to fit in your mouth makes them so much better than all of the other standard dental guards that you boil or just pop in.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other products that you boil and mold but they tend to be very bulky and pricey.</li>
            <li> It is small enough to fit in my mouth and is easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> I think the product is okay, but it&#x27;s not really going to solve the particular problem I&#x27;m having.  </li>
            <li> The profile is ridiculously slim and much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> I thought when I ordered them that they would be like every other bite guard and cover all of either the top or the bottom teeth.</li>
            <li> It takes a little to get used to, but it&#x27;s a lot better than those ones you heat with hot water and then mold to your mouth.</li>
            <li> The fit is OK (average size female) and</li>
            <li> This product is much better than expected!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for anyone who does not want a large guard sticking out between there lips.</li>
            <li> These are simple and small, and do a great job of preventing him from grinding.</li>
            <li> clean it daily with mouthwash and/or toothpaste.</li>
            <li> They clean up easily for reuse, but I am not sure if they are recommended for reuse or not.</li>
            <li> They can last way longer than what it says if you keep them clean.  </li>
            <li> much less cumbersome and more comfortable than a regular mouth guard.  </li>
            <li> They are small and fit comfortably.</li>
            <li> At first I was very hesitant to purchase this item; but I&#x27;ve used up a box of 14 so far.</li>
            <li> For a female with a relatively small jaw, these work great.</li>
            <li> Also, for my teeth clenching problem, it seems like I could easily use a single guard for a month if not a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, it wakes me up and easy comes loose in my mouth.</li>
            <li> When you get the package you might be surprised because of the size of the box (the guards sit on your back set of teeth, this is not a full mouth guard), but these are very nice quality.</li>
            <li> I think that the biggest downfall with this grind guard is that it really isn&#x27;t a one-size fits all piece, my bottom row of teeth are not perfectly straight so this guard really didn&#x27;t stay where it should because it couldn&#x27;t be customised to fit.</li>
            <li> aren&#x27;t adjustable and aren&#x27;t quite as long as my SleepTek guard, but after sliding the guard around in my mouth for a bit I found a comfortable position.</li>
            <li> I just brush these when I brush my teeth in the morning and let it dry all day and at night it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> : headaches have completely vanished thanks to this product!</li>
            <li> it covers the back teeth and isnt a full mouth guard.  </li>
            <li> Only the full size guards give you protection without creating movement in your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my month is kind of small</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other mouth guards, and these by far are the most comfortable.  </li>
            <li> , I had a semi flexible/semi rigid full upper custom mouth guard &amp; i would grind &amp; gnash the hell out of it.....</li>
            <li> This is definitely true as they do not reach my back molars.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re simple and small, and I&#x27;m usually able to forget I&#x27;m wearing them and fall asleep easily.</li>
            <li> so you use them 2 or 3 days and just throw them away and get a new one!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty sure a single one will last me 50</li>
            <li> The product was fairly comfortable to put on but it didn&#x27;t seem very secure to me and in the middle of the night I was awoken from a dream in which I was trying to remove something stuck in my mouth and obviously it was a reflection of reality because the dental guard was just loose in my mouth, not attached to any</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to see less packaging, lower price or more appliances.</li>
            <li> Sold as more or less disposable, they are reusable.</li>
            <li> I was previously using SleepRight Dental Guard because of its slim profile, but this is even better.</li>
            <li> directions say they are only good for a few days</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s mainly because a)</li>
            <li> Since my kids seem to steal these, super gross, I know,</li>
            <li> When I woke up, I had tremendous pain in the back of my jaw, which Grind No More&lt;br /&gt;did</li>
            <li> I would have actually been better off sleeping without it because it concentrated the pressure on my back molars instead of spreading it out evenly.</li>
            <li> Keep that in mind if you are running low and need to get these in quickly.</li>
            <li> Mine only had mild wear after one night.</li>
            <li> With me, these guards reach to my back bicuspids, and that is more than enough to keep my jaws from clenching.</li>
            <li> I love these mouthguards because they&#x27;re so light and thin.</li>
            <li> These are the only things that have actually worked for my nighttime teeth grinding and actually fit in/stayed in my mouth!</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and grind pretty severely on most nights.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also just soft enough to be comfortable yet remain effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> particularly for travel.  </li>
            <li> They prevent grinding OK overnight, but breakdown a lot faster than the more expensive ones.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure to wash them the same as you would a regular night guard or a retainer.</li>
            <li> The guards fit really poorly due to their extra soft form and moved around so easily that unless my jaw was super clenched it wouldn&#x27;t stay in properly.</li>
            <li> It interrupts my sleep, and it is a choking hazard - steer very clear of this product!</li>
            <li> bottom line is that these Plackers Mouth Guard Grind No More Dental Night Protectors have worked the best because they take up minimal space in the mouth while still providing sufficient spacing between the upper and lower teeth to protect from grinding.</li>
            <li> I rinse daily in very hot water to get the gunk off.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, makes my teeth feel a little weird in the morning, but goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> As a longtime, nighttime, teeth grinder, I highly recommend these Plackers mouth guards.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these to anyone needing a bite guard to keep themselves from grinding their teeth at night.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to ease grinding at night.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I bought these with high hopes of helping me with my clinching issue.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>

            <li> Would like the bite part to be a harder material but for three days it should work out fine.</li>
            <li> These are far too large for my mouth.</li>
            <li> Regardless of the size of your mouth, it should be a pretty tight fit between the outer wall of your mouth and your gums</li>
            <li> I love these little guards and replace them monthly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I ordered this, it came no problem, The second time, the status said &amp;#34;delivered&amp;#34; but there was no package, though I suspect certain neighbors found they had mouth guards with no idea what to do with them.</li>
            <li> The cost of doing that with the other brands was adding up very quickly.</li>
            <li> I had hoped that it would be good because I have a small jaw (normal nigh guards are much too large), but it just is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> This was a great alternative to a rather expensive night guard from the dentist.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand why the change to this version instead of the old ones.</li>
            <li> These are a great alternative to expensive permanent use custom guards.</li>
            <li> Unlike other night guards, they are not a full mouth guard, they fit like a retainer on the top OR bottom teeth, whichever you prefer.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a weird feeling in my mouth but the work great during the day...</li>
            <li> ...figured they&#x27;d fall out easily or be uncomfortable, but they&#x27;re great.  </li>
            <li> nights I have a harder time getting comfortable with it</li>
            <li> For the extra $.19 each, it is worth buying through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> You can barely notice it after the first couple of nights.</li>
            <li> These are better than a full mouth guard because the plastic in front is so thin.  </li>
            <li> It is worth the try and definitely cheaper than getting  a device from your dentist.</li>
            <li> My bite has now returned to a normal feeling.</li>
            <li> The instructions say not to use if you are missing 2 or more teeth, but I don&#x27;t know why.  </li>
            <li> After a few nights, I got used to it, and now I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> but for now I am on auto delivery as you can no longer find them in the store and the cost is pretty much the same.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After just a couple days, I feel almost completely normal again.  </li>
            <li> I have some missing molars on both the top and bottom of my mouth and</li>
            <li> They help without hurting your teeth or being bulky like the normal mouth guards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also read reviews saying they aren&#x27;t good for clenching as they stay in one place and hurt your gums or direct the pressure to only a few teeth - HERE</li>
            <li> It seemed to work fine for other people.  </li>
            <li> I like that they are flexible and not a hard rigid guard on your teeth.  </li>
            <li> These last me a week or so, and then I get to throw it out and have a brand new fresh one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller and less bulky than the one I&#x27;d used that I&#x27;d liked from Target.</li>
            <li> These last 2-3 weeks easily and even then only seem to lose some of their springiness rather than wearing through.</li>
            <li> : If you have a strong jaw/bite like me and they aren&#x27;t too small that you&#x27;d swallow them, - you&#x27;ll end up flattening it out after the first night or two</li>
            <li> They slip right between your back teeth and are unobtrusive.</li>
            <li> These fit a little too large for my mouth.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if placker is the only device that is contributing to this new problem, but it can on top of the others I&#x27;ve mentioned: chewing on side and a lot of jaw action in trying to keep my teeth/gum clean.  </li>
            <li> I have struggled with several other brands out there (dentek custom comfort dental guard, sleep right slim comfort and sleep right secure comfort) - but sleeping with giant mouthpieces in your mouth is not comforable.</li>
            <li> The only issue is they don&#x27;t put material between all your teeth, just the main group of grinders - not a problem for me as my tooth squeezing is pretty even.</li>
            <li> - other night guards I&#x27;ve tried were so huge, I couldn&#x27;t sleep at all.</li>
            <li> These fit extremely well and don&#x27;t move around.</li>
            <li> I have tried other mouth guards, but none have been comfortable.</li>
            <li> have never had it fall out at night and when you wake up it is true that at first you feel like your jaw is a little misaligned, but trust me that resolves in like 10 minutes and it&#x27;s not severe....</li>
            <li> These seem good, though they are a little rough.  </li>
            <li> The good thing about these is that one is able to close ones mouth whereas other mouth guards are bulk and hard to keep mouth closed.  </li>
            <li> My dentist is making me a new one tomorrow</li>
            <li> You can use a new one every night if you want to, but each guard is usable for 3 days a piece.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t afford a new one, so</li>
            <li> Then just throw it away and get a brand new one.  </li>
            <li> I use mine for 5-7 days then throw it out and use a new one.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live without them.</li>
            <li> I had a mouth guard made which cost $$$$ but with new crowns etc</li>
            <li> After three days, you throw it out and switch to a new one, which you would want to anyway because they do start to flatten out around day three anyway.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Snug, custom fit, never falls off, tiny, easy to wear, and was slowly teaching my body to stop grinding my teeth.</li>
            <li> The mouth guard is kind of flimsy, but its only meant to be used for a few days.</li>
            <li> They are flexible, light weight, and simple to use on your upper or lower teeth.  </li>
            <li> I suggest buying a smaller quantity to see how these fit before buying the larger value pack here.</li>
            <li> Now, i&#x27;m waking up in the middle of the night because my bottom jaw is constantly trying to find a comfortable resting place while using this.</li>
            <li> And mostly just because I misplaced the old one and figured it was time to change it</li>
            <li> Have tried more expensive mouth guards and could never find any that were as comfortable as these.</li>
            <li> The plastic is very soft (think day-old gummy bear candy-ish), and they don&#x27;t rub your gums.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll</li>
            <li> The Plackers are very soft, but I don&#x27;t think I might buy again since they adjust my teeth while I use them.</li>
            <li> The part in the middle that keeps your teeth apart was actually OK, and I was surprised to find that I could fall asleep with it in with not too much trouble on the first night of wearing it.  </li>
            <li> I currently do not need to use them, but I also cannot attribute the remedy to just these mouth guards; I also successfully reduced my stress (which was the main culprit behind my teeth</li>
            <li> They seem to be based on a small set of perfect teeth and a very weak bite… in which case, you wouldn&#x27;t need a mouth guard for in the first place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of mouth guards, including the custom ones from the dentist, and I&#x27;ve pretty much given up on every single one.</li>
            <li> Definitely works as a tooth that had been sore before due to the grinding is much better now.</li>
            <li> No More guards serve their purpose better than $700, custom made dental appliances</li>
            <li> I was worried as to how exactly it would stay in my mouth, but the fact that when I put it in no one could tell that it was in left me hopeful still.</li>
            <li> I remedied this by placing the protector in a pot of hot (not boiling) water for about 10 seconds, just like you do with the regular boil n&#x27; bite protectors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 2nd week with the first one</li>
            <li> Even with the hot water stretching treatment, the guards still do not reach all the way to the back teeth.</li>
            <li> They are not terribly uncomfortable but definitely took me an hour to fall asleep with it</li>
            <li> I believe this has more to do with the variations in my grinding than variations in the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given that this product is designed to be disposable, I definitely recommend the Plackers as a first-line product before moving to more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> I just tried these for the first time last night</li>
            <li> They are soft enough to be comfortable yet sturdy enough to stay in place &amp; protect your teeth.</li>
            <li> These do not over all your teeth, but do provide a biting/clinching/grinding area made of soft plastic that takes the damage your teeth normally would.  </li>
            <li> I thought I might accidentally choke on them at first, but they totally stay in place.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t keep them in for a significant amount of time due to this.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it seems to work better than the larger guards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I sleep like a baby now, and no more headaches :)</li>
            <li> The sixty dollar drugstore model was ok too but the dog got that one also.(dogs name is SLICK</li>
            <li> The positioning keeps my jaw slightly open and any of my teeth from touching each other, so I for one do not have to worry about my teeth clenching problem any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not sure I wasn&#x27;t clenching my teeth even more to compensate.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find my back teeth touching like one of the other reviews said.</li>
            <li> If the company re-designs the product, I might try it out again as I like having these simple disposable ones vs putting the same one in for 6 months - a year (call me OCD, as much as I clean em</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few of the boilable/adjustable ones, but no matter how much I kept them clean, my teeth and gums felt \\&quot;trapped\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> then the user can just cut down to fit the length of their bite.</li>
            <li> then the user can just cut down to fit the length of their bite.</li>
            <li> I know that some mornings I wake up and feel the tops of my teeth where these are being clenched down on seems smooth.  </li>
            <li> major CHOKING HAZARD!!!</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to receiving this because of its high reviews and because it looked like a similar sample product my orthodontist gave me for my tmj.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so the typical mouth guards don&#x27;t fit or stay in place during the night.  </li>
            <li> I realized this doesn&#x27;t exactly fit my mouth about a week in a half in.</li>
            <li> 500 dollar bite guards from the dentist are way less comfortable than these.</li>
            <li> The first night I used it, only minutes after dozing off, miraculously I woke myself up nearly choking on the mouth piece.</li>
            <li> Even though they are advertised as disposable, I&#x27;ve been able to use a single guard for a few weeks (just disinfect it the same way you would a full size guard).</li>
            <li> Had a miss aliened crown with a bad bite causing unwanted wear on my crown as I slept and this guard stopped the sleep grinding damage on the crown ,also fits nicely on upper or lower and stayed in my mouth the hole night without falling out and caused no breathing problems, I highly recommend this product for its excellent design and  fare price!</li>
            <li> But this is based on my own clinching habits - if you clinch harder they may not last as long.  </li>
            <li> These barely fit my 9 year old daughter&#x27;s mouth, much less mine.</li>
            <li> I keep them next to my bed, and next to the couch in case I get a chance to take a quick nap.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a ton of more expensive, less effective solutions out there.  </li>
            <li> I have a large mouth and it left two teeth uncovered on all four side.  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product from a store that had marked it down, lower than the price sold here.  </li>
            <li> These little fellers are fantastic.</li>
            <li> was a little concerned because they don&#x27;t fit like the dental night guard I had.</li>
            <li> They last as long as the Dentek guards, are easier to clean (one rubber piece, not an assembled piece with crevices), and I don&#x27;t grind the rubber off like I do with the Dentek guards.</li>
            <li> It even left little marks on my front teeth that are now more prone to staining.  </li>
            <li> They felt a little funny at first, but after one night of wearing them, I got used to it.</li>
            <li> Partial and full mouth &#x27;boil to fit&#x27; small retainer types including the little adjustable comfort fit ones.</li>
            <li> Within a couple nights wear, the affected fractured tooth calmed down, and am very pleased with this little soft appliance.</li>
            <li> in my experience the hard plastic ones from the dentist work a lot better (although they&#x27;re obviously a lot more expensive) for getting you to grind less-the chewy soft disposable ones just make you more likely to chew on them.</li>
            <li> still have the occasional dream about chewing a really bad hamburger, or some gum, but am so happy to wake up chomping on this mouthguard rather than degrading my teeth!</li>
            <li> still have the occasional dream about chewing a really bad hamburger, or some gum, but am so happy to wake up chomping on this mouthguard rather than degrading my teeth!</li>
            <li> So clearly there will be NO protection for my teeth.</li>
            <li> which isn&#x27;t clear to me...</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have TMJ, but if you&#x27;re unsure, I&#x27;d steer clear.</li>
            <li> far, 5 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can a 4 year old wear these.</li>
            <li> However this isn&#x27;t a con for us since he prefers to switches them out frequently.</li>
            <li> While you could use these just once and dispose of them, I have been able to use them over and over again (I rinse them well after using and store them during the day in a container with some mouth wash) for at least two weeks.</li>
            <li> After 1 night of using this product I noticed it completely adjusted my bite.  </li>
            <li> He recommended a &amp;#34;boil &amp; bite&amp;#34; if you can&#x27;t afford the professional one he would make in the lab.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re so soft.</li>
            <li> I can see just one lasting me for weeks, maybe a whole month.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m a 24 yr old girl...</li>
            <li> At this rate, I won&#x27;t be surprised if the box of fourteen lasts for years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, I decided to give these a shot since they are so much cheaper and the shape was similar.</li>
            <li> They are too big, but the most important is that they slip on the sides, which mades them useless.</li>
            <li> I am on a fixed income and cannot afford crowns.  </li>
            <li> I guess if you find yourself unexpectedly spending the night out.  </li>
            <li> She is 7 years old and as she has starte to get all of her adult teeth</li>
            <li> The Plackers product are clearly marked as disposable and are recommended for only 1-3 uses before disposing; however, they are far and away the cheapest of the reasonably highly-rated products on Amazon, so I thought I&#x27;d start there.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well they work...</li>
            <li> I felt the difference after one night and now my 9yr old son uses them.  </li>
            <li> Pleasantly Surprised.</li>
            <li> My old guards would leave&lt;br /&gt;ridges and sore marks on my side gums.</li>
            <li> Plus Amazon offers an auto ship program that just sends them monthly.</li>
            <li> (however, if the company developed one with a shorter \\&quot;bridge,\\</li>
            <li> (I try to avoid too much plastic exposure when possible)</li>
            <li> (I try to avoid too much plastic exposure when possible)</li>
            <li> I tend to chew more with something in my mouth but at least its not teeth against teeth</li>
            <li> My husband uses these, he really does not like the bigger ones.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a concern enough not to try these if you really know you&#x27;re grinding at night.</li>
            <li> I have had the professionally made grind guards before and they never stayed in my mouth, they just ended up lost in the sheets.</li>
            <li> These guys went directly in the trash afterwards.</li>
            <li> I also use Young Living oil Valor, rubbed on the jaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I believe this caused some motion of the teeth themselves that resulted in considerable pain on one molar and that side of my face.  </li>
            <li> so soft.  </li>
            <li> I can never throw away my old plates.  </li>
            <li> They are soft, so I still grind which doesn&#x27;t alleviate jaw and head aches</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they work as well as the professionally made ones</li>
            <li> thing that surprised me about this was the size and how its made.  </li>
            <li> These are not going to work for anyone as far as I can tell..</li>
            <li> just get a professional one done...</li>
            <li> After wearing it, I had somewhat of a naturally tendency to not clench my teeth,</li>
            <li> the bite guards are further back, and if it islarger they are closer to the front, but the function and tight/secure fit would seem to be the same for anybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth so much that I&#x27;ve had to get multiple drillings on the molars to fix &#x27;em.</li>
            <li> She likes them and is surprised that they have lasted as long as they have since at first glance</li>
            <li> They were ok but did not fit my mouth and constantly fell out.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re effective, thus far, and my only complaint is the brand-name raise-printed on it, which abrades the skin it touches.</li>
            <li> One size most definitely does not fit all.</li>
            <li> I spent thousands of dollars worth of custom made anti-grind contraptions &amp; chewed thru them all.</li>
            <li> The guards are too thick and bulky, plus they don&#x27;t fit well in my month!</li>
            <li> Dental work, even with good dental benefits, are expensive.  </li>
            <li> At least Plackers acknowledges it and give you a box full at a reasonable price so you can discard one and start new.  </li>
            <li> (The sleep right were smaller, but they were too deep and hurt my gums).</li>
            <li> For day to day I use the Sleep Right Dental Guard, which is larger, and the bite wings pivot, so it is actually a three-part guard.</li>
            <li> Unless you are constantly biting down on it, it slides out of place easily.  </li>
            <li> I first put on my lower teeth and it seemed a little large.  </li>
            <li> They are small and easy to use.</li>
            <li> review is after only using it one night, but to counter some other reviews I saw I would like to suggest that one size should fit all.  </li>
            <li> Having used full mouth guards for my teeth grinding for years, these seemed like a novel solution and less of a mouthful, as it were.  </li>
            <li> After a few days of using another device that is bigger between the top and bottom jaw, everything went back to normal.</li>
            <li> I was fairly skeptical at first, especially after opening the package to see what they actually looked like, but it does seem fairly well</li>
            <li> the bite part was a bit thicker as I do wear them down quite quickly.</li>
            <li> The pads that protect your teeth are only about a 3/4 of an inch long and fit on your back molars.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that some nights they rub up against my gums as they fit a little too snuggly which is surprising considering I have a pretty small mouth.</li>
            <li> they are only one small piece, I thought it would fit my whole mouth.</li>
            <li> No more headaches and more important, no more dizzy spells!</li>
            <li> They only go back to the first molar.  </li>
            <li> They were actually too small in my opinion, more like child size.</li>
            <li> first night pit it in only 30 mins, 2nd night 2hrs</li>
            <li> I got the small package the first time just to try them out, so I would recommend that for a first time trial.</li>
            <li> I was experiencing major tooth aches and jaw pain from the grinding, but that completely went away after I started using these guards.</li>
            <li> main reason I like them so much is they are not  bulky like the other mouth guards on the market</li>
            <li> happening.&lt;br /&gt;The price is right, and cheaper than other products that claim to be dental-quality.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t rate that this high enough!!!!</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviews that as long as you clean them each morning, these should last much longer than 3 days each.</li>
            <li> had previously used fitted mouth guards (boil in water to form fit), but they always felt too big and cumbersome.  </li>
            <li> I notice my grinding was getting bad again more recently, I tried looking for better alternatives.</li>
            <li> Not good then :-)</li>
            <li> and it really solved the problem I have with grinding and clenching teeth for a long time.</li>
            <li> They do fit a small mouth.</li>
            <li> Small and comfortable...</li>
            <li> Comfortable, prevents me from grinding (which I&#x27;ve cracked teeth in the past doing).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The first two nights were rough.  </li>
            <li> it took me all day exercising my jaw to get it back to it&#x27;s normal alignment.</li>
            <li> But, for me after each night of use, my teeth don&#x27;t bite together as they normally should and thus will grind on edges after these are taken out for hours the next day.  </li>
            <li> These Plackers protected exactly where I clench and grind, with minimal invasion to my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I feel that these encourage me to clench my teeth more due to the guard not staying in place and having biting down to hold it.</li>
            <li> They are so small and low key, it&#x27;s easy to forget you&#x27;re even wearing one!</li>
            <li> They are large enough to not get accidently swallowed but small enough that it is comfortable in her mouth.  </li>
            <li> These little pads fit in your mouth with no extra boiling, shaping, or discomfort.</li>
            <li> These little mouthguards are comfortable enough to wear at night and even during exercise or just when you&#x27;re stressed and tend to clench or grind your teeth.  </li>
            <li> REALLY hard to get used to as they don&#x27;t fit well into an adult sized mouth.  </li>
            <li> Can easily wear them on the upper or lower teeth (kind of prefer the lower myself), and after one night of feeling a little weird with something in my mouth at bedtime, I had no problems.  </li>
            <li> I lost my custom mouth guard recently and i was trying to avoid paying another $450 to get a new one.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t see myself paying  $30+ for guards that either had to be constantly replaced by warranty or replaced by a new one.</li>
            <li> I went to my dentist last October for a new bite guard, and it cost $550.</li>
            <li> the when done throw awAy and open new one thank you</li>
            <li> They also don&#x27;t dry out my teeth by covering too much side surface.</li>
            <li> They are very flexible and low profile and can be used either on the upper or lower teeth.  </li>
            <li> They absolutely prevent grinding and chomping, and I personally wash them and use them for a couple of weeks (even though the package recommends only 3 days of use per guard).  </li>
            <li> One piece of advice though: wear it on your bottom teeth because I&#x27;ve come to realize that when you wear it on the top, it falls out while you&#x27;re sleeping (at least for me since I tend to sleep with my mouth open at times).</li>
            <li> I recommend finding a single package (they come in a box of 30 for $20+ dollars) before buying a whole pack.</li>
            <li> I wore it for years, but I would still wake up with major headaches.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t fit right and was uncomfortable</li>
            <li> Also, if you&#x27;re not familiar with this product, know that in most cases it means you&#x27;ll sleep with your mouth open and wake up dry...</li>
            <li> easy to use, doesn&#x27;t hurt the teeth or gums, not too big, not too small for the mouth.</li>
            <li> For a few weeks I have been chewing food mostly on one side to avoid food stuck in the other side where I had the infection.</li>
            <li> My jaw feels a little funny after I take the guard out in the morning, but I imagine that&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not perfect, and they certainly don&#x27;t fit like a custom guard, but for the price they are a very reasonable solution.</li>
            <li> These have been a lifesaver to me over the last several years highly recommend</li>
            <li> After several sleepless nights I stumbled across these mouth guards on Amazon; we both didn&#x27;t have high hopes, since they seem kinda tiny, and flimsy.</li>
            <li> I have a small jaw and reading the reviews I had pretty high hopes.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s fine as you are supposed to replace it every few days!!  </li>
            <li> They are small and light, but if you put them in properly, you shouldn&#x27;t have an issue.</li>
            <li> However given enough time will soft plastic pushing on the mouth change appearance?</li>
            <li> I wore these for a month straight and had absolutely NO relief in my jaw pain from clenching.</li>
            <li> This is the only mouth guard that works for my teeth so far.</li>
            <li> The plastic is soft but sturdy at the same time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them about 2 weeks now and was hoping it would stop hurting, but it just scrapes the sensitive gums enough to hurt</li>
            <li> Neither can stop your clenching or the grinding action you make with your mouth, they only protect your teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this fall after dental work and my habit of clenching left my teeth extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li> Initially,the upper teeth were sensitive to the thing.  </li>
            <li> With this mouthpiece, I barely know its in</li>
            <li> and you can barely notice you are using them while sleeping.</li>
            <li> They are way too soft and actually lead to a lot of jaw soreness</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least a dozen different brands, and all seem to be too big and bulky to be able to sleep well with.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wear the bigger mouth guards at night because I never fall asleep - they don&#x27;t feel natural.</li>
            <li> Basically your tongue never touches them and they&#x27;re far enough forward to avoid feeling like you&#x27;re swallowing a piece of plastic.  </li>
            <li> I was clenching my jaw at night apparently without realizing it.</li>
            <li> They might be useful for traveling, or to address a temporary situation, but they&#x27;re too flimsy for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I wear the mouth guard every other night, and it is so durable that I can actually reuse it (as long as keeping it clean).</li>
            <li> First night down</li>
            <li> Well if you have that big of mouth or don&#x27;t constantly clench your teeth throughout the night so they stay put, I would recommend buying a single pair from Walgreens first before investing in a multipack.</li>
            <li> I replaced the first one after month and a half.</li>
            <li> These unique mouth guards are very different from the usual ones.  </li>
            <li> And they aren&#x27;t bulky, they are very light weight and thin, but substantial enough that someone who has ground holes in sports mouth guards over time, like me, can still use it for 3 nights</li>
            <li> It does protect your teeth from grinding each other but i always wake up with jaw muscles feeling very tensed up and sore instead.</li>
            <li> In fact I think I was clenching harder because it feels like it destabilizes my bite and my teeth don&#x27;t really know where to settle...kind of like chewing two pieces of old gum all night long.</li>
            <li> I always bought the no-boil dental guards, but they are so hard to keep clean.  </li>
            <li> that &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; on each other now thanks to years of TMJ and a crappy dental procedure 20 yrs ago.  </li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t go far enough back to stop the Jaw from closing.</li>
            <li> They have a soft chewy pad on each side in the back and when you close your back teeth into the pad</li>
            <li> Both the professional guard at $500, and the Plackers Mouth Guard adds a buffer between your upper and lower teeth that prevents that physical grinding  damage.  </li>
            <li> The insides poke my tongue and the band doesn&#x27;t go far enough into the back of your mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried most of them and they&#x27;re uncomfortable, even the professionally fitted ones from the dentist.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They are inconspicuous--no more feeling like you have a giant wad of plastic in your mouth--and they don&#x27;t make you look like you&#x27;re about to hit the ice hockey rink for a playoff game.</li>
            <li> Not so fast , right i realized i had to bite down a little harder then normal to keep it in my mouth</li>
            <li> By having such a small area of product to absorb and distribute the sometimes very strong forces of nighttime tooth grinding, it seems that the teeth above and below where you bite down on the product take the brunt of that pressure.  </li>
            <li> These little dudes are absolutely a God-send!  </li>
            <li> Took a little while to get used to them, as I want to chew on them when I first put one in my mouth.</li>
            <li> A little plastic for 6-8 hours a night would take years to move it a little and its more likely that what change you did make at night would revert during the day.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t generally have a problem with the Sleep Right falling out, but the Sleep Right is extremely expensive</li>
            <li> These Plackers are totally the way to go - cheap and small!</li>
            <li> They have a small piece that runs along the front of your top or bottom teeth and are connected to small but useful pieces of plastic to bite down on.  </li>
            <li> I woke up in the morning with the little, tiny guard still in place, teeth that didn&#x27;t feel like cotton on them from having a mouth guard encasing them in so much plastic wrap, and you could clearly see my teeth marks on the plastic.  </li>
            <li> These are small and fold easily in your mouth if you are note careful.</li>
            <li> Very soft and thin, better than any other guards I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The only downside I can see is that if you have a very large mouth, they may not fit well.</li>
            <li> try to sell you, or to the ones that say they last 3-6 months but are hard to keep clean.</li>
            <li> Maybe this works for protecting against grinding, but I&#x27;m not sure the cost of an adjusted bite is worth it.</li>
            <li> I can usually get a weeks worth of wearing out of them.  </li>
            <li> Since I have teeth missing on the top, I used it on the bottom as there is only one missing.  </li>
            <li> It is a good concept, but it is a very poor product!  </li>
            <li> My son said it&#x27;s thicker than his previous ones, so a bit less comfortable in the mouth.</li>
            <li> I can use it for a week or two no problem before it gets ground down too much.</li>
            <li> Does the job, and is a lot more comfortable and less expensive than other over the counter products I have used.</li>
            <li> The current size could be for small mouths and then make a slightly thicker (1/16&amp;#34;) one for bigger mouths, because I am thinking that very large mouths could just move the guard around at night.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s much cheaper than the SleepRight—for about half the price of one night guard, you get 14.</li>
            <li> Small, comfortable and allows you to keep your mouth closed.</li>
            <li> just unbelievably nice.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update the post later if it starts to perform less than stellar, but if the first night went this</li>
            <li> I have only had one minor headache so far since I began using these things six weeks ago.</li>
            <li> After you open them there is no case so he just pops it in a small baggie, add a couple drops of mouthwash to keep it fresh.</li>
            <li> They are small and it&#x27;s nice that they are disposable, so when they get icky, I just throw them out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thickness of pads -&lt;br /&gt;They aren&#x27;t super thick, but I don&#x27;t grind, so it&#x27;s not an issue for me.</li>
            <li> But I got tired of tasting and swallowing the strong Plastic Chemical taste these have.  </li>
            <li> My very back teeth were still able to connect because I bite down so hard, and I think I was grinding the protector INTO my mouth-flesh with my sideways grind, which caused the sores.</li>
            <li> My first attempt to use it was a complete failure.  </li>
            <li> These really help me sleep at night without disturbing my better half.</li>
            <li> By too big, I mean the bridge was too long and wouldn&#x27;t fit over my teeth properly and stay put.</li>
            <li> So at night I was grinding down hard enough, that my back teeth were still touching and were producing a jaw-not-aligned properly feeling for the next several days after wearing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really stay in place and since I move my tongue when I rest or sleep, it dislodges the little pad that rests on the teeth on either side.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They don&#x27;t look like much, but you feel like you are treating yourself when you see all the neatly stacked little packages.  </li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s not going to really be prevented by these little guys.  </li>
            <li> No such luck, because they are not long enough to cover your back teeth.</li>
            <li> As other folks have mentioned, this is a nighuard you can live with.</li>
            <li> other concern was that when I bite down on the thing when I&#x27;m awake, it actually tends to slip out of place and my teeth go right back together.  </li>
            <li> They looked a little suspect at first, but I&#x27;ve been using these for months and haven&#x27;t choked to death on a single one.  </li>
            <li> Fits great in my small mouth, fits my dentist&#x27;s recommendation of a thin one so not to mess up your bite.</li>
            <li> Overall, a decent little product.</li>
            <li> then halk night, its really help my jaw but not easy to wear it at all</li>
            <li> These mouth guards are great because I don&#x27;t actually grind the back down so badly and can be worn for longer than the 3-day recommendation.  </li>
            <li> still have 10 of them in case I need to use them again; this pack is plentiful and discarding one after only 3 uses is unnecessary if you clean it after each use.</li>
            <li> Some other guards I&#x27;ve found end up causing your lips to be propped open at night, and you wake up with a very dry mouth - and in the desert, a decent amount of dehydration.</li>
            <li> Which I noted above is what I do, SO, UPDATE TO THAT - after a couple of nights, it no longer gets so malleable so that  it gets flimsy, so to speak, but it stays somewhat flat</li>
            <li> Tired of sore and unopenable jaws, I gave this a try and it reduced my pain significantly.</li>
            <li> He then told me it actually makes clenching worse and that only full mouth or anterior mouth splints should be used for clenchers.</li>
            <li> They really do not take much getting used to at all, and with less severe grinding they last a week to several days each.  </li>
            <li> Unless I have a really big mouth, these were much too small and wouldn&#x27;t stay in place.</li>
            <li> Not sure how many nights I have used this, but it is at least 20</li>
            <li> Yes, the plackers are smaller, and if you use an individual one too long</li>
            <li> The protector is now stretched enough so my back teeth are cushioned by the protectors.</li>
            <li> I can absolutely see this thing slipping down my throat as I sleep</li>
            <li> It gets loose in my mouth, and I actually came very close to swallowing it a few times.</li>
            <li> I previously wore dentist made hard plastic molded night guard, which no longer fit on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> yes i grind my teeth, sucks, but these are small and you can have them on top or bottom of your mouth, about the only ones i keep in my mouth all night long, took a bit to get use to</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit comfortably and it keeps my mouth open which is not good as my mouth will feel dry which in turns causes tooth decay due to decreased saliva.</li>
            <li> Instead of going back to the dentist for another expensive thing that is easily lost, I went this route.</li>
            <li> They do not stay in your mouth and is super thin, not even enough material to prevent you from grinding.</li>
            <li> These usually don&#x27;t make me gag too much</li>
            <li> but I really like the small size.</li>
            <li> however long they are supposed to last.</li>
            <li> and if I wear it too long it is malleable enough that in my sleep my tongue just curls it up and out of the way</li>
            <li> Unlike an athletic style dental guard, it is barely visible and has minimal impact on one&#x27;s speech.</li>
            <li> and they last a long time.</li>
            <li> They last for a long time if you use&#x27;m nightly.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes they will last only one night and other times they will last several.</li>
            <li> As noted by another reviewer, the protectors last remarkably long for a disposeable product.</li>
            <li> They last a long time and don&#x27;t need to be tossed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they last a long time; even though they are recommended for disposble use after three uses.  </li>
            <li> can see why these aren&#x27;t what some people want in a mouthguard, but they are seriously worth a shot if you&#x27;ve had problems with other brands in the past.</li>
            <li> They are soft, clear plastic, but thick enough you won&#x27;t chew through on one or two nights.</li>
            <li> I often  wake up with a mouth full of blood, and some instances broken teeth not to mention headache every morning</li>
            <li> Why not just bite down on any old piece of plastic?&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that they looked so little, and they don&#x27;t go all the way to your back teeth</li>
            <li> These grind guards seem to be working well, and they are lasting a long time!  </li>
            <li> I destroy the bite wings with a weeks&#x27; time, and with these I can just toss it and grab a new one out of the pack.  </li>
            <li> The product was not long enough to cover my back teeth and also not significantly \\&quot;squishy\\&quot; enough to protect.</li>
            <li> Small, slim fit for my small mouth.  </li>
            <li> Upon inspecting the bed I found it in the middle of the bed, bone dry.</li>
            <li> After a week both my husband and 11 year old son have no complaints and both report less grinding.  </li>
            <li> I think it is just the wrong shape for my mouth, in addition to being too flexible for my strong jaw clench and side-to-side grinding pattern.</li>
            <li> I was about to order these on Amazon when I found single packs at the Dollar Tree- for a dollar obviously.  </li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and the pads go back almost as far as the molars in front of the wisdom teeth, but doesn&#x27;t totally cover those molars.</li>
            <li> Never had a problem of almost swallowing it or inhaling it, although its possible it might come loose</li>
            <li> The first night I tried it, I was really annoyed for having spent all of that money, because it just felt way to big for my (pretty small) mouth, and it made me gag.  </li>
            <li> What finally clued my dentist in was receding gums, which he said was due to clenching, and finally breaking some teeth.</li>
            <li> As with other mouth guards I have used, the fit is poor and cuts into my gum line.</li>
            <li> Over time its more expensive than other options.</li>
            <li> but you need to look at it very carefully because it is also very slim on the material and one size does not fit all</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a small female and much like other reviewers</li>
            <li> Though the package says to dispose of each one after 2-3 days, I use a single grind guard from this package for weeks, which means this will last you for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Initially it was working out fine, but a week and a half later it started irritating my gums due to the sides digging into them.</li>
            <li> This little item, barely noticeable in one&#x27;s mouth, actually works.  </li>
            <li> and it is hard to understand why it costs so much.</li>
            <li> These little protectors work pretty much the same way the expensive ones do: keep the teeth separated and thus prevent grinding.</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth every single night, stress or no stress (and have entirely flat canine teeth as a result).</li>
            <li> When I do throw the guard away I usually see deep bite marks in it and laugh at how hard I must actually grind at night!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nearly as bad as the grinding on its own.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t fit me well.</li>
            <li> This product does not work for me - it does not stay in place on top teeth or bottom, I was afraid i&#x27;d swallow it during the night.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit, didn&#x27;t work and was uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> so a package lasts me a long time, maybe a month.</li>
            <li> Choking in the middle of the night is not what I expected when I bought this item.</li>
            <li> They seem to have recently been made of a harder plastic</li>
            <li> They did prevent the grinding for as long as I could stand to wear them.</li>
            <li> I use them every day, but you can use them as frequently or not depending on your symptoms.  </li>
            <li> I can only sleep if I have my mouth closed and</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is normal..</li>
            <li> According to the package, you should change them every three days, but I&#x27;m only seeing minimal damage to the guard after that time.  </li>
            <li> I even use them on long car rides when I nap.</li>
            <li> It took this long to figure out where they originate from.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been grinding my teeth at night for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> i was looking so long for something who can help to stop grind while sleeping</li>
            <li> It causes my mouth to rest in a semi wide open position, which over time the mouth guard moves out of place and ends up sitting inside my mouth on my tongue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a long story.</li>
            <li> What a complete waste.</li>
            <li> It is bit smaller than expected.  </li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and it for ok, not great though.</li>
            <li> These are pretty basic, I like that they are thin and no gagging</li>
            <li> If you do the math, that means you&#x27;ll have to buy a new pack at least every month-and-a-half, since there are only 14 per pack.</li>
            <li> The packaging says you can use a single one up to three times before tossing, but I&#x27;ve found that by the third night the thing is in pretty poor shape.</li>
            <li> These are the only mouth guards I&#x27;ve ever used, but I can&#x27;t imagine anything else being smaller, simpler and less bothersome.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, last night I broke my NTI device in half and had to resort back to these mouth guards.</li>
            <li> I had used a different mouth guard previously and it was too big even after adjusting it.</li>
            <li> so I ma a lot less likely to spit it out in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li> I mean, really, does each have to be encased in a plastic tub?</li>
            <li> I usually trade it for a new one.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I could possibly have is that it will occasionally slip out of its place which inevitably causes me to have a dream where I&#x27;m chewing gum while munching on the mouth guard.  </li>
            <li> I tried other varieties that are larger but they irritated the inside of my mouth and several times the other varieties led to canker sores.  </li>
            <li> I alternate to the other cheek to give one side a rest.  </li>
            <li> Other brands were way to big to sleep in.  </li>
            <li> I tried 3 or 4 other styles of mouth guard, and they were just too big and bulky...</li>
            <li> Finally a dentist told me my teeth cracked and broke due to night time jaw-clenching and grinding.  </li>
            <li> These just slip over your upper or bottom teeth, and the little plastic pads cover the back teeth.</li>
            <li> I would encourage anyone to buy a box and try them because they aren&#x27;t that expensive and are definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> Only the teeth that are sunk into the pad grind against the pad---not other teeth.  </li>
            <li> I alternate between two and keep the other one in a bowl of listerine.</li>
            <li> I occasionally grind my teeth at night (usually due to stress).</li>
            <li> Bought for TMJ pain due to clenching my jaw, since I saw several reviews saying that they could be used for this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every other night guard there is and the result is the same, they all get destroyed.  </li>
            <li> I wear them with my plastic (not wire) retainers, which is not possible with other devices.</li>
            <li> I will likely try another brand due to these concerns.</li>
            <li> and yeah it felt a little weird, but I could use it on the top teeth or the bottom teeth</li>
            <li> Used to use other brands with similar shape</li>
            <li> I like that these are smaller than other types, but the inside of my cheeks are getting torn up.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, after spending so much to fix my teeth I decided to get serious about this mouthguard business.</li>
            <li> I wash my guard in the morning and let it dry in the tray</li>
            <li> I would wake up with dry lips, drool, and a sore mouth.</li>
            <li> They said that the smell was just left over from the manufacturing process and if the smell bothered me I could open them up and leave them for a few hours to &amp;#34;air out&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> These are sturdy enough to use for several weeks and I am a heavy grinder.  </li>
            <li> They are thick compared to the older design, but they do the job well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They seem quite durable and I grind alot, yet can use a single one with washing for months.</li>
            <li> I dream every single night now.</li>
            <li> Small, unobtrusive, much nicer to use than typical molded night guards.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable and thin enough that you hardly even notice it.</li>
            <li> This morning, my teeth feel like they don&#x27;t sit together in the same way as usual, my jaw is even more tense and tight than it usually is when I&#x27;ve been clenching and grinding all night, and I have a BIG sore on each side of my mouth lined up with where the protector met it.</li>
            <li> It seems odd to have this in your mouth and your natural reaction is to bite down on it.  </li>
            <li> I am a petite woman with a smaller than average mouth.</li>
            <li> It might just be how I grind my teeth, but I find these sometimes go almost entirely flat on one side before they do the other.</li>
            <li> I do not normally review products, but I make an exception here.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m willing to spend the equivalent of $7 month on these until hopefully the grinding pattern is broken.</li>
            <li> Not perfect, but not bad.  </li>
            <li> tried on last night, not very fit it.</li>
            <li> For starters, they don&#x27;t stay put in one spot, they keep shifting around loosely.</li>
            <li> Also, the product was so loose that they just slipped out within seconds.  </li>
            <li> They are loose in your mouth</li>
            <li> I always felt like this thing would come loose</li>
            <li> Once it was loose in my mouth, it woke me up</li>
            <li> These are hanging and dangling loose in your mouth, but then there is no worry about changing the bite.</li>
            <li> Just pop in mouth every night, and dispose when they start to loose there strenght.  </li>
            <li> I have never choked or had them come loose during the night.</li>
            <li> with blow dryer for 5 seconds (it will only be not even half dry but will blow off some of the water).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have noticed that I can only wear one for 2 nights in a row because it gets flattened when I bite down on it during the night</li>
            <li> I had been grinding my teeth at night, and my dentist said that it was starting to wear down my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Well by the third night I stopped biting down on it and the dreams about it</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m not biting down my bite has changed enough that my jaw has stopped hurting too.  </li>
            <li> Felt unnatural and biting down on it only hit some of my teeth which made my jaw hurt when I woke</li>
            <li> They are &amp;#34;guardy&amp;#34; enough to prevent grinding but small enough that I don&#x27;t spit them out in the night.</li>
            <li> This makes it less likely to carry germs</li>
            <li> The device works by slightly separating the upper and lower teeth which prevents night grinding.  </li>
            <li> My only fear is that I will bite it in half and swallow it or choke on it.</li>
            <li> appearance change?&lt;br /&gt;Other larger devices will push your mouth out and makes you look odd while wearing.</li>
            <li> I woke up during the first two nights having weird dreams about puzzles and such</li>
            <li> Before I started them I&#x27;d just cracked a molar completely in half and had to have it extracted - total agony.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after the first night, my jaw actually felt a bit sore, and my bite seemed all off.  </li>
            <li> Super uncomfortable and couldn&#x27;t close my mouth with it in.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re mostly bulky and awkward, or they&#x27;re expensive and wear down to quickly for me.</li>
            <li> This product only has a thin plastic piece that goes around your upper or lower gums and hooks to two flat pieces that go between one or two of your back teeth.</li>
            <li> They are a refined and well made product, free of sharp edges or other uncomfortable features.</li>
            <li> For heavy teeth grinders, these don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> So if you have a BAD case of bruxism, and strong jaws, give these a try, can&#x27;t recommend them highly enough.</li>
            <li> I happen to have a sensitive tooth in the area which quickly became painful.</li>
            <li> These only make contact with a few teeth, so if you actually bite down on them overnight, you&#x27;ll wake up with</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth at night but have a lot of drainage down my throat so other night guards make me gag because they are to big and bulky.</li>
            <li> According to my dentist, I only grind a little bit at night, so I can&#x27;t speak from the perspective of someone who grinds heavily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just open the little package and pulled out another one.</li>
            <li> The front section fits under your upper (or lower) lip, and the little wing (pads) hug your molars.</li>
            <li> These little babies are totally simple to use, and protect one&#x27;s teeth from grinding pressure.</li>
            <li> Peace of mind that my teeth might last a little longer.</li>
            <li> There is only one, little concern I have to pass along.</li>
            <li> No More Dental Night Protectors over a year ago because the custom dental made mouth pieces are expensive and most of the other OTC ones are too bulky for my mouth.</li>
            <li> They are very small and for the price you can throw them out once they get worn and get a new set.</li>
            <li> I can hardly feel it in my mouth, and can even talk clearly with it in.  </li>
            <li> Smaller and less obtrusive than a lot of other guards.</li>
            <li> They hit right behind my eye teeth and have nothing to hold them in, so I felt the need to hold on to it tightly</li>
            <li> Works as expected and dirty cheap</li>
            <li> they work, and b) they are by far the least obtrusive.</li>
            <li> Only a few nights in,</li>
            <li> but I am currently in a location where it is not available, so I had to order it.  </li>
            <li> and  I don&#x27;t use up the package as fast.ll bothered me I could open them up and leave them for a few hours to \\&quot;air out\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> a few days ago I am finally seeing symptoms of TMJ.</li>
            <li> a lot!&lt;br /&gt;For me they last about six weeks rather than just a few days.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It took a few nights to get use to it, but I have been using them now for the last 6 weeks</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth, and for the last few visits to the dentist, I&#x27;ve been told to purchase a custom nighttime grind guard.  </li>
            <li> .Be careful.</li>
            <li> For me, a medium-sized male, the device fell out and went missing each of three consecutive nights.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected but usuable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is finally a small, barely there option that allowed me to sleep without feeling like I had 2 lbs of plastic in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bough 3 different brands and they all felt bulky and ended up being torn in a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After I woke up one morning thinking if I clinched my teeth together any harder</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a lifelong nighttime tooth grinder, and I needed a temporary mouthpiece to counter some severe pain from an abscessed molar and</li>
            <li> Not really what I expected.</li>
            <li> I am a lifelong grinder and bruxater and tend to wear through anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> You can reuse the tiny disposable cases a few times as well</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to wear a guard every night, but I needed something to get me through rough patches.</li>
            <li> and my problem is manageable - otherwise I was recommended an expensive surgery with no guaranty of success..</li>
            <li> and I had heard tell of folks grinding through the big heavy mouthpieces</li>
            <li> They take up minimal space in your mouth so you won&#x27;t spit them out in your sleep as your tongue attempts to fight them off.  </li>
            <li> I have literally spent thousands on night guards from dentists over 20 years.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from bruxism  try these they are minimally invasive.  </li>
            <li> I have not noticed them slipping off.</li>
            <li> Tried these one night and it was obvious within a few hours they weren&#x27;t going to work for me.</li>
            <li> I am a grown woman; however, apparently my mouth is too small for these.  </li>
            <li> It lasts about a week each and it only takes a few days to get used to the rubbery taste and feel.</li>
            <li> My other concern is choking on these things since they keep sliding all over my mouth and coming loose.</li>
            <li> problem is that when you bite down your front teeth want to keep moving down while your back teeth are stopped.</li>
            <li> My dentist explained that the bit wing should not have excessive squishyness, as that trains the sleeper to repetitively bite down;  rather the proper bite wing should be soft enough to not damage teeth but hard enough to train the sleeping brain to not bite.</li>
            <li> My mouth felt even more tense than usual and general uncomfortable feeling in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I have used the expensive bite guards through the dentist and either chewed right through them</li>
            <li> In one of these the local women wore appliances to push out their mouth for a permanent (very odd) appearance.</li>
            <li> - I think because my teeth were slightly apart for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> now a few months later - no more symptoms, especially the horrid TMJ headaches.</li>
            <li> Also, I get to throw them away after a few uses and being the germophobe that I am, I no longer have little images in my head of growing bacteria in little carrying cases that the old ones were once kept in.</li>
            <li> I clench my teeth really really hard - I&#x27;ve broken two and always get a tremendous headache.  </li>
            <li> very few items does what it is made for, but this one really does the job, at least for me.</li>
            <li> I have to throw them out after one use because of how hard I grind, but apparently some people can use them for up to three times.</li>
            <li> I have a bad nighttime grinding problem and I generally use the The Doctor&#x27;s Advanced Comfort Night Guard teeth grinding product sold on Amazon, but I do use these Plackers Mouth Guards for emergencies--usually, when I am traveling and forget to bring my usual night guard along.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re quite small, so potentially a choking hazard, but if you&#x27;re a teeth clincher like I am then</li>
            <li> My husband prefers these over the other mouth-guards he has tried.</li>
            <li> i would suggest this for travel due to the convenient size.</li>
            <li> Did a lot of swishing, rinsing, brushing, and flossing prior to using grind no more.</li>
            <li> Wayyyyyy too big for my small mouth.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t made of poky plastic, and they don&#x27;t have sharp edges.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use them anymore due to using a mouth guard that stops sleep apnea, otherwise I would continue to use these.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, my grown daughter uses them &amp; loves them.</li>
            <li> Based on other reviews, for three years now I have used for 10 days in a row before disposing.</li>
            <li> The item is small enough and doesn&#x27;t bother him at night, unlike the bulkier mouth guards that he will spit out.</li>
            <li> I was not able to find this (or similar) item at a dollar store, so I ordered it online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband picked up these minimalist guards for me about two weeks ago, because he knew from past experience I could not get through the night with a traditional guard.</li>
            <li> it was for small mouths, but it was still too big.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews and some people don&#x27;t mention the jaw pain</li>
            <li> These are alright, they protect your teeth from wearing at each other...</li>
            <li> I like them because they aren&#x27;t as bulky as the other ones.</li>
            <li> And it is inexpensive compared to other products.  </li>
            <li> Worked we&#x27;ll n helped me to not give me head aches in the mornings when I wake up due to grinding</li>
            <li> Feels weird at first</li>
            <li> and then I noticed it was happening with other teeth.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try this after reading reviews for it and other products.</li>
            <li> It definitely beats paying a small fortune for a mouth guard at the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> My Dentist recommended these as it seems I grind my teeth at night due to the pressure and stress I am under.</li>
            <li> so any other is hurtful...</li>
            <li> My teeth started hitting each other and I was in a lot of pain.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews, we chose this product for his TMJ.  </li>
            <li> I feel like if they were longer then they possibly would have worked but even then I am not sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased Grind no more several times.  </li>
            <li> I tend to choke on other brands, or find myself looking like Chewbacca.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and a low gag reflex</li>
            <li> I am not going to tell you not to buy it and all that other junk rambling that goes after , but i can tell you that it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Opened one up to use the first night I had them and found that it made my bottom teeth sit weirdly and made my jaw feel misaligned.</li>
            <li> Then I noticed that the warnings on the side of the box say to not use if you have tooth or jaw pain due to clenching or grinding.</li>
            <li> Based upon my reported comfort level and reduction in damage to my molars, my dentist asked me what brand I was using to recommend to other patients.</li>
            <li> I just want this small pad covering my back</li>
            <li> I was having headaches and jaw pain due to teeth grinding at night.</li>
            <li> Dentist it was due to grinding and clinching.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dentists make dozens of upper/lower big, small, etc.  </li>
            <li> I tried a couple other over the counter night guards and found them to be too bulky in my mouth.</li>
            <li> These are made well enough that they usually survive this nightly chewing nightmare.  </li>
            <li> They cost just over $1 each (rather than $30 for other kinds of mouthpieces)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I use each one for about 3 weeks before it becomes too worn down and starts slipping off my teeth at night.</li>
            <li> Be very careful when deciding to purchase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please be very careful if you have a history of clenching and grinding using these.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Big enough to remain in place all night, but small enough to protect my teeth without irritating my gums or altering my bite.</li>
            <li> I stretched a little from the center, and a little from each side.</li>
            <li> but they tend to get a little loose by that time.  </li>
            <li> I wash them off each day and use them longer than the instructions say, not knowing why they should be so dirty so quickly if they&#x27;re cleaned well after each use.</li>
            <li> but these are small (even with my small bite) and move around way too much in my mouth during the night, resulting in uneven pressure on teeth, odd bite, and soreness in the morning.  </li>
            <li> It feels dry and sticky after a few minutes and it always keeps me up at night.</li>
            <li> I could be wrong as I&#x27;m not a dentist, but I&#x27;m going back to using the Doctor&#x27;s Night Guard as that has worked very well for me in the past.</li>
            <li> And with no small amount of trepidation, I tired them one night.  </li>
            <li> Although it seems impossible that they would actually stay in position in your mouth all night, they do stay, are not uncomfortable, and do the job.</li>
            <li> I tried that I had to boil and sink my teeth into; that one hurt my jaw and held my mouth closed tight.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the guards are too large and will not stay put.  </li>
            <li> Feels a little weird when you first put it in, but you will get used to it.</li>
            <li> After going thought multiple hard plastic over the counter and dentist made $500.00 night guards</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already lost 3 custom hard guards over the last 10 years at $250/ea</li>
            <li> I grind really badly, so they don&#x27;t actually protect my teeth as well as something thicker would, but at least it muffles the sound and does provide some protection.</li>
            <li> (Plus I don&#x27;t have to buy another one for $30 and go through the whole weird boiling process again.)</li>
            <li> I have had two custom-made night guards in the past and they only lasted for a few years each.  </li>
            <li> The device is &amp;#34;one size fits all... as long as you have a fairly small mouth.&amp;#34; Be warned.</li>
            <li> The only negative for me is that they tend to slide out while I&#x27;m sleeping.</li>
            <li> Can get expensive but very convenient.</li>
            <li> So not worth the money.</li>
            <li> And the pain and whatnot that you also go through is not worth it either.  </li>
            <li> not in my mouth anymore so.. not useful for me</li>
            <li> see how things go a month from now, but i suspect each one will last at least 5-6 days</li>
            <li> Tried it a few times it didnt really fit my teeth and was very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I can usually go a week or two before I need to throw one out so one box can last a few months.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I worry my bite is shifting.</li>
            <li> Not worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> This was MOSTLY because I HATE wearing mouthguards.</li>
            <li> They are not big, thick &amp; bulky.  </li>
            <li> Nothing to keep it in place and, like other reviewers, I noticed after only a minute or two of wear that my jaw had become extremely tense.</li>
            <li> previous mouth guards I have tried forced my mouth to stay open.</li>
            <li> You can also wear them upside down if your mouth prefers it.</li>
            <li> This is a way to keep your teeth and not grind them down.  </li>
            <li> I have stopped biting down on it and stopped fidgeting around with it.  </li>
            <li> Eventually, it yellowed, and I saw that I had started to grind that down as well.</li>
            <li> I tried it out during the day and laid down like I would to sleep.</li>
            <li> Each one lasts about 3-4 days before wearing down, as the box says.</li>
            <li> and then you bite down to form them to your mouth.</li>
            <li> - I was biting down on these guards almost in reflex to having them in there, or perhaps to try to hold them in place.</li>
            <li> No need to mold them to your teeth with boiling water like other mouth guards, and you don&#x27;t end up looking like a wrestler when you go to bed!</li>
            <li> I put this guard in, pads facing down, and before clamping down on the pads, I slightly jut my lower jaw forward, then clamp down.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them several times &amp; always wake up to find them floating loose in my mouth -- or even worse, lost in my bedding.</li>
            <li> I may plan to wear it every other night or every few nights, depending on how things go.  </li>
            <li> I read reviews saying that these only last for a day or two, but I am a bad grinder and these last several days (5-7) at the least.</li>
            <li> I have to wonder why the unit cost of the 14-count is less than the 24-count.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re the type of grinder than could cut through steel-belted radials then you might experience less durability.  </li>
            <li> I wore mine while I was awake for about an hour and a half to try it out before wearing it all night.</li>
            <li> Update of my previous review.</li>
            <li> Only having the splitter at the back teeth was weird for a minute.</li>
            <li> They feel bulky, but I have never worn a mouth guard, so maybe it&#x27;s typical.</li>
            <li> that causes my back, shoulder and arm, depending on which side is tense to hurt as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the more expensive boil-for-a-custom-fit mouth guards, but I always end up spitting them out at some time in the night because they either collect spit or inhibit breathing, so they end up being useless.</li>
            <li> slightly swollen gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not a perfect size, but it works better than custom night guard, and I am protecting my expensive caps.  </li>
            <li> Each one lasted less than a month.  </li>
            <li> I seem to wake myself slightly up at night with the guard in, realizing I am clenching.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;About half the nights I either spit them out or take them out.</li>
            <li> These guards are&lt;br /&gt;feather-light, and I have never removed it in my sleep, as I had with previous night guards.</li>
            <li> Stops grinding and also cuts her snoring in half...</li>
            <li> Literally cracking them to pieces due to the repetitive and extreme pressure.</li>
            <li> I go through one every 2 weeks or less.</li>
            <li> My TMJ is so much less</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall: 4/5 stars, the front retaining strap should be slightly longer as it is too &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; and bothers my gums when I try to sleep.</li>
            <li> They are small enough for my small mouth.</li>
            <li> Holy cow!  </li>
            <li> It has a small footprint and is soft, I tried others including professional ones, all of which felt horrible, were spat out at night and in some cases caused worse receding gums due to pressure on the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;One question though: any idea if this is pthalate free?</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t wake up with headaches.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not too expensive relative to other options, and for how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> The package says &amp;#34;One size fits all&amp;#34; but that is not true.</li>
            <li> Because I have a small partial plate, I could not get these to work.</li>
            <li> The Plackers are small, and low profile, but being small do sometimes fall out of place during sleep, usually just on one side or the other.</li>
            <li> These things mess up my bite every night.  </li>
            <li> In the past, the guards were too large and rubbed him the wrong way.</li>
            <li> I click my teeth at night and sometimes would wake up from a dream with my jaw clenched tight.</li>
            <li> I will say; however, that they do run on the small side, so if you have a wide arch (I don&#x27;t want to say a &amp;#34;big mouth&amp;#34;, but that&#x27;s what it comes down to...LOL!)</li>
            <li> These bad boys quickly take on body temperature</li>
            <li> Either is much better than the very expensive custom bite guard from the dentist, which I am convince led to another broken tooth.</li>
            <li> This makes me feel that wearing will actually make my problem worse because wearing a grinder makes you bite down on it during the night because your teeth sense that something is there,</li>
            <li> but I need something different they always felt like I was choking or that I would choose them so bad they wouldn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> It is so small in comparison to the other one, I thought I would choke on it</li>
            <li> This little device works well.</li>
            <li> These little guards also  keep me from snoring.  </li>
            <li> I used to have one of those NTI super-expensive little guards for my front teeth that I had made through my dentist for $400.  </li>
            <li> They stop my teeth grinding with just a little flap of rubber.  </li>
            <li> The little flap get all chewed up after a while.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a little worried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not sure how other people get them to stay in place</li>
            <li> low cost option &amp; poor fit; woke up choking :-(</li>
            <li> Relaxing my jaw or moving my lip even a little would cause it to flop out of position.</li>
            <li> These little guards, however, do an alright job at protecting your teeth while you chomp and grind away at night.</li>
            <li> They might seem a little costly</li>
            <li> Also sometimes the little piece doesn&#x27;t stay on the molars</li>
            <li> , your dentist can make a little appliance you&#x27;d have to wear for an hour or two in the morning to correct it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I rinse it and put a little mouthwash on it before re-use.  </li>
            <li> plus they are not bulky like the other mouth guards I&#x27;ve had in the past</li>
            <li> No more grinding my teeth down, no headaches or tight jaw when waking up.</li>
            <li> Could be related, very common with anything orthodontia.</li>
            <li> I hate those huge mouthguards that you see in sports or in the health and beauty section</li>
            <li> I keep using them until I destroy them</li>
            <li> /&gt;you get scratches on your gums if you use it everyday</li>
            <li> I just used it for a few nights.  </li>
            <li> Not comfortable for me.</li>
            <li> It passes in just a few moments.</li>
            <li> After using the Dentek bite guard for a few years they redesigned it for the worse.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had issues with professional bite guards, either because they&#x27;re uncomfortable or because I take them out when I&#x27;m sleeping.</li>
            <li> Sure beats the heck out of the $400 monstrosity that my Dentist always tries to push off on me that gets nasty after a few week&#x27;s use.  </li>
            <li> After a few nights of sleep, I almost forget that I am wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like that they are disposable after a few uses</li>
            <li> You can even talk or drink water without removing the device and it remains firmly in place during use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say you can get quite a few uses out of each one</li>
            <li> and I am heavy grinder.</li>
            <li> This was just not comfortable.  </li>
            <li> These may or may not fit you.</li>
            <li> I just soak them with a denture cleaning tablet for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> A waste of my money.</li>
            <li> It just became a waste of materials and money for me.</li>
            <li> They were a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> Did not fit.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Wasted my money.</li>
            <li> After a few days of use, almost all of the symptoms were gone....</li>
            <li> Use for a few weeks then replace.  </li>
            <li> yet these did not fit at all.</li>
            <li> One size does not fit ALL.</li>
            <li> Thin enough to not interfere with your bite.</li>
            <li> They keep me from destroying my teeth in my sleep.  </li>
            <li> After a few nights they start to lose their effectiveness (as your teeth begin to flatten out the cushioning).</li>
            <li> only make the grinding worse.</li>
            <li> I totally wasted</li>
            <li> wasted my money</li>
            <li> BUT - turns out that is totally unnecessary - and thank god because those guards are so massive it was like trying to sleep with a tennis ball in my mouth!</li>
            <li> A couple of years ago I wrote a One Star review of this product, but I was being overly harsh, and I want to correct that now:</li>
            <li> My grinding problem doesn&#x27;t destroy these in 3 days so i tend to wear each one for a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll sleep a few days without them</li>
            <li> If you lose one you haven&#x27;t lost a few hundred dollars.  </li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s not particularly comfortable</li>
            <li> Wish I&#x27;d have found these 10 years ago and saved myself a few cracked/worn teeth.  </li>
            <li> Incorrectamundo!I&#x27;d have found these 10 years ago and saved myself a few cracked/worn teeth.  </li>
            <li> It does take a few nights to get used to sleeping with something in your mouth though.</li>
            <li> One size doess not fit all</li>
            <li> was expecting the guard to fully wrap around my upper or lower set of teeth, but these are designed so that the guard is a bit behind my canines.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel too thick but thick enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> I use the Grind No More to keep my teeth slightly apart</li>
            <li> I usually use each guard for about 4 days until they start to feel odd.</li>
            <li> I can also report less snoring from the husband!</li>
            <li> The other ones are just too big and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other mouth guards from the drugstore-they are expensive and fall apart after a short while.</li>
            <li> Not only does it work for the chomping, but also for any snoring or other weird noises that men seem to emit when unconscious...  </li>
            <li> I had a hard time sleeping with other types of grind guards in my mouth...</li>
            <li> I got a box of these night guards at Hannaford Brothers in Gorham Maine for $18.99 (which I thought was a bit stiff).</li>
            <li> These little things allow me to sleep with very little getting use to it.</li>
            <li> I wore it on my upper teeth, because it was snug and seemed solidly in place (when tested on my lower teeth, the retention band dug into the area below my front teeth and was very uncomfortable).</li>
            <li> After a few days of using one I usually flip it over and can use it another few days.</li>
            <li> the size is a little bit small</li>
            <li> I think they are a little too small.</li>
            <li> I found them very uncomfortable and they made my jaw very achy and sore.</li>
            <li> I have a relatively small mouth, but these would not fit or stay in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Way too small, not comfortable.</li>
            <li> I was a little leery about the size (I was paranoid about choking on them) of these guards because they are so small compared to what I have tried in the past</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d wake up my sore gums that felt like they were being rubbed raw.</li>
            <li> ,I tried the one that we boil in water and set, but not only they hurt my mouth and never really fit correctly they were expensive , they start to take on odor and have to be replaced</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s changing my bite a little, but I can tell it&#x27;s helping!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been grinding my teeth since what seems like forever, and these little mouth guards have been my savior!</li>
            <li> its subsequent treatment (too long a story, but a bad root canal job can be a hidden time bomb!...</li>
            <li> A little hard to talk with them in</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth really hard and this holds up for a few days before I toss them.</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth in my sleep and wake up with a bad headache or sore mouth way too much.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I would even wake up with toothaches in my rear molars from clenching so bad, but these really help cushion the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more pushing sideways against my molars at night.</li>
            <li> They are so small and non invasive, you can talk and you don&#x27;t see them.  </li>
            <li> These might work for a teenager with a small mouth.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m a small woman...</li>
            <li> No more No more No more mo mo mo</li>
            <li> I have had custom guards in the past and thought I&#x27;d try these just to see--</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has been over a week since I have stopped using grind no more.  </li>
            <li> My front teeth are now hitting when I close my mouth, which has never been a problem in the past.  </li>
            <li> They have nothing to hold them there, so I&#x27;m not sure how, but I move them off my teeth (maybe with my tongue) at night, so I can still grind away.</li>
            <li> He has been using these for months and no more headaches</li>
            <li> He thought they were too small, but he has all of his wisdom teeth grown in.</li>
            <li> No more teeth chipping from grinding, but as months passed, I&#x27;d wake up feeling like my jaw was out of alignment and sore.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth.</li>
            <li> what a waste of money!</li>
            <li> In the past I have used Doctor&#x27;s Nightguard (just a boil and mold football style mouthpiece with fancy packaging for 500% the price), and</li>
            <li> I can usually use one per week, instead of the 3 days.</li>
            <li> No more jaw pain (I&#x27;ve been a clencher since having my wisdoms removed).</li>
            <li> No More is so small it does not change your appearance even temporarily</li>
            <li> That is when I changed to Grind no More.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Storage: The Night Guard box will hold the Grind No More.</li>
            <li> He usually switches every 3 days.</li>
            <li> but the fact is they are to small, even for my small mouth.</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth at night and usually wake with sore jaws.  </li>
            <li> My husband tried it, and it was too small for him.</li>
            <li> These are small, stay out of the way and work.</li>
            <li> The guard is small and flimsy.</li>
            <li> when I brush my teeth, my jaw is not sore anymore, no more headaches, and when I wake up my teeth don&#x27;t feel sore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also I have a small mouth and peoplesaid</li>
            <li> No More.</li>
            <li> no more \\&quot;YOU NEED ANOTHER CROWN\\&quot; story when I went to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I am terribly thrifty and have been using for more than three nights each.</li>
            <li> I use these to release my teeth from clunching teeth which usually causes migraines.</li>
            <li> They usually fall out by the time I wake up.</li>
            <li> This is a flexible, small yet do-the-job-well mouth guard.</li>
            <li> no more sore jaws from grinding teeth against nightguard.  </li>
            <li> no fitting needed), and inexpensive alternative to the ones that dentists make.</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;ll buy these again even though my dentist has suggested twice in a year I need them for clenching.  </li>
            <li> so not sure,</li>
            <li> Its just two small pads with a small connecter.</li>
            <li> , this guard was too small on the mouth (didn&#x27;t extend all the way to my molars).  </li>
            <li> no more gagging on bulky mouth guards.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend, who usually wakes up from my grinding, hasn&#x27;t heard me grinding my teeth since I got these.</li>
            <li> They are small</li>
            <li> One size is toooo small.</li>
            <li> I have the problem in the past 20 years, and created a lot of  mouth pieces at the dentist, spending a lot.  </li>
            <li> prefer these usually than the dentist one.</li>
            <li> these will probably be too small.  </li>
            <li> Since I discovered Plackers, I have no more pain</li>
            <li> They were only a $1, how could you go wrong.</li>
            <li> Plackers work by putting a bit wing between the molars, which prevents excessive pressure.</li>
            <li> /&gt;they do their job but as soon as you wake up in the middle of the sleep you have a soar mouth and weird feeling</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and it will not stay in place in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> The product is so small it will not stay put in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> I just soak in a small bowl of mouthwash in the mornings.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the full-mouth guards before and these work just as well if not better for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been told by dental hygienists that I have small teeth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the boiled mouthguard in the past, and it bothered me when I tried to sleep.</li>
            <li> Maybe for a child or someone with a really small mouth.</li>
            <li> Its basically two small pads with a nylon (or whatever) cord between them.  </li>
            <li> i used one, and threw the rest of these grind no more away.  </li>
            <li> ,I don&#x27;t even know I am wearing it, and it work wonderfully, no more headache, no pain, and no grinding...</li>
            <li> Not sure why</li>
            <li> With Plackers, no more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Really small design.</li>
            <li> One slight complaint is that theres nights where I grind my teeth really hard and in the morning, it somewhat changed my bite in my mouth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning, what I do.&lt;br /&gt;Remove and hold under faucet running water for 2 seconds or so.&lt;br /&gt;Sprinkle on a mouthwash, just a very few drops.&lt;br /&gt;Rinse again with water for 2 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say for a very heavy clincher like myself could get about 5-6 days out of one.</li>
            <li> I hate to give low reviews, but these may do the same to someone else, so I had to say something.</li>
            <li> I found these on Amazon to be the least expensive, especially if you have automatic delivery.</li>
            <li> Small, hard, snap on pieces.  </li>
            <li> I can usually use them at least a week.  </li>
            <li> is the scary name for a very minor but annoying condition (a small fissure in the very corner of the mouth lip.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it will help anyone to know this, but I am very small and my mouth is small</li>
            <li> He tried a couple of the expensive single, longer-lasting, mouthguards, but sometimes he loses them in his sleep.</li>
            <li> Seriously, these say to use them for no more than 3 days and then dispose of them</li>
            <li> The ones made by dentist are too hard</li>
            <li> and so hard they hurt my gums.  </li>
            <li> I can hardly tell I am wearing one now that I am used to it.  </li>
            <li> /my hard  </li>
            <li> The rubber edge rubs my gums, the material is too hard</li>
            <li> like them because they&#x27;re flexible and gummy, rather than just hard, molded plastic.  </li>
            <li> You hardly notice it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time with finding a bite guard.  </li>
            <li> Hardly notice this in your mouth and it stopped pain in the jaw that was developing from gritting/grinding.  </li>
            <li> In the meantime, I found I was grinding so hard, I cracked my front tooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are hard to find in drug/grocery stores</li>
            <li> Hard plastic bands in your mouth are not the solution</li>
            <li> these Plackers still work--just as advertised--it&#x27;s hard to believe, just to look at them.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand the hard guards my dentist keeps telling me I &amp;#34;must&amp;#34; use.</li>
            <li> When I used them I had a hard time falling asleep and woke up a lot thinking I was choking on something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t hard</li>
            <li> Hard to find in my area.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE as of Oct. 2017: The smell/taste seems a little worse..</li>
            <li> These little Plackers are thin and flexible, stay put</li>
            <li> Also the narrow piece that connects the two ends pushes up against the tops of my gums, which is a little uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Awkward initially but fulfills my needs inexpensively both sleeping and at the gym.</li>
            <li> well, they work at least for</li>
            <li> I personally thought that it felt flimsy and awkward.</li>
            <li> but they were awful and didn&#x27;t fit correctly at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid it will fall to the back of my throat while I&#x27;m sleeping</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m afraid to try it a second night.</li>
            <li> but with this one I at least can fall asleep</li>
            <li> I was tired of buying expensive mouthguards only for my dog to chew up</li>
            <li> I have no idea why not, but the fit was awful.  </li>
            <li> Some day my stress might lessen and I can quit wearing at least in the day</li>
            <li> I was so afraid I&#x27;d end up choking on it in the middle of the night.  </li>
            <li> Now I have 4 veneers in the front and there is NOTHING on these suckers to protect your front teeth.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d suggest trying them out at least once</li>
            <li> At least it can reduce some of the shifting of your teeth, yes using night guards shift your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I will continue for at least 2 months to see if there is a change in my sleeping habits.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t listen to negative reviews.</li>
            <li> My dentist had recommended a nighttime mouth guard because my rear molars are slowly grinding away.</li>
            <li> product is made of thick plastic, which could work</li>
            <li> Others I have used were too thick and made my jaws ache.</li>
            <li> Got these for my hubby, but they are way too small!</li>
            <li> But for all other reasons I&#x27;m calling this a fail.  </li>
            <li> No more morning headaches!  </li>
            <li> Way too small!</li>
            <li> These made my jaw pain worse. :/</li>
            <li> Very small.</li>
            <li> I have a very small mouth (as my dentist always tells me)</li>
            <li> I have a very small mouth</li>
            <li> Only issue was this guard was very expensive.  </li>
            <li> I tend to be a mouth breather at night with a very small jaw/mouth.</li>
            <li> they are very small</li>
            <li> I also like that I can replace them and don&#x27;t have to keep the same gross disgusting mouthguard for a year or</li>
            <li> Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Third, Plackers do not have hidden crevasses that make cleaning difficult.</li>
            <li> It starts from clenching my teeth at night and my neck muscles tense up.</li>
            <li> When I grind my teeth at night my neck muscles tense up,</li>
            <li> But before, I don&#x27;t take it seriously until that one time</li>
            <li> I was hoping these would irritate me less, but unfortunately the front lip retaining &amp;#34;strap&amp;#34; tends to both my gums.</li>
            <li> Seriously?</li>
            <li> I was tired of using my old invisalign retainers as my mouth guard, so quit using anything and found myself clenching and grinding badly at night.  </li>
            <li> I recently suffered a nasty bout of molar pain on one side, and I partially attribute this to the small surface area of this product that is used to prevent grinding (and perhaps also to its not staying in place in the mouth).  </li>
            <li> They can be a little uncomfortable because the plastic rubs against my gums, but they do their job and stay in place all night.</li>
            <li> My mouth does feel a little weird after I take it out in the morning; it seems that the alignment of my bite changed at night.</li>
            <li> These are smaller and do intrude on my tongue&#x27;s home, but not too bad.</li>
            <li> I have such bad grinding at night and these have made my AM headaches go away.</li>
            <li> These are not good if you have or think you have tmj.</li>
            <li> Still a bit of clicking when I open my mouth but not as painful</li>
            <li> No good after 2-3 uses..  </li>
            <li> (not a good option)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this seemed not good -</li>
            <li> They are still somewhat uncomfortable and my mouth is dried out in the morning--</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple of the &amp;#34;boil and bite&amp;#34; types, but they are all so thick and bulky that I often end up in worse pain.  </li>
            <li> Prior to using the gaurds I had been grinding to the point that I was sick to my stomach in the morning from the headache</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fourth, the Plackers guard is nearly tasteless compared to other guards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and he says you hardly feel or notice it!</li>
            <li> You hardly know it&#x27;s there!</li>
            <li> By-the-way, you can wash these and use them again- depending on how hard they&#x27;re used!</li>
            <li> I expected it to be very uncomfortable but it is not.</li>
            <li> my jaws not all sore next day from clenching or grinding &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> and not a nice tasty one!</li>
            <li> These are really small and somewhat uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not molded so you are biting very hard plastic.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to this product I don&#x27;t suffer from horrible headaches.  </li>
            <li> got tired of losing the $600-model the dentist sells.</li>
            <li> Instead all they are is a thin strip of rubbery plastic attached to two &amp;#34;wing&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Lightweight, thin and no boiling!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Since I have found these Plackers, there have been no trips to the dentist for cracked or broken teeth.</li>
            <li> The least disturbing night guard I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> My man-friend keeps me up at night by chomping his teeth like one of those plastic fish the rotating go-fish game...</li>
            <li> At the end of the two week period, these are flattened out and thin as paper.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like knowing I&#x27;ll have to buy these maybe for the rest of my life, but I really don&#x27;t like having lost teeth to this awful condition.  </li>
            <li> so it didn&#x27;t fall out of my mouth or even worse I chock on it in my sleep.</li>
            <li> Convenient for travel or when you are tired to use your dentist customized night protector, just for a change.  </li>
            <li> In short, they did crap all to help my night grinding.  </li>
            <li> I use the guard to combat the effects of night clenching, which includes broken teeth and headaches in the morning.</li>
            <li> Alas, that is not a problem.  </li>
            <li> Thin, and that works for me.</li>
            <li> After a week or so they get too thin to continue using and I swap em out.</li>
            <li> However, it could be way worse.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, at the least these are not one size fits all.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a terrible and awkward fit.  </li>
            <li> I mean it is a piece of plastic in your mouth - it is going to be uncomfortable no matter what,</li>
            <li> After some damaging grinding due to a bad alignment of my teeth, my dentist suggest I try these.</li>
            <li> This turns out to be a serious and expensive dental issue if you don&#x27;t take preventive measures.</li>
            <li> I hate grinding my teeth, but I also hate having a mouth full of rubber that I can&#x27;t stop sucking and chewing on.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so small and flexible, I would be afraid to fall asleep with this in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Her teeth were being grinded down which started to look bad.  </li>
            <li> read some people&#x27;s dramatic reviews that they almost choked on them.</li>
            <li> Very tense muscles that cause a fatigued feeling.  </li>
            <li> I clench my jaw a lot in my sleep and wake up feeling very tense in my face.  </li>
            <li> The bad thing is that it can mess with your jaw.  </li>
            <li> but this was a real disappointment and headed back for credit.</li>
            <li> I read reviews about people being afraid to swallow them, but that is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> the bad thing is all they do is provide a cushion so you don&#x27;t grind as hard on the surface of your teeth.</li>
            <li> In trying to figure out what went wrong I came across moltencat&#x27;s review here</li>
            <li> Even my &amp;#34;dentist made&amp;#34; expensive ones did not work.</li>
            <li> The others were too bulky and difficult to sleep with.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have to worry about losing them like I would with an expensive mouth guard.</li>
            <li> Uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> These are uncomfortable and even though my dentist recommended that I get a night guard, this just doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> It was just uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> The bite wings on the sleep rights always rubbed my cheeks and were uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> And they&#x27;re expensive.</li>
            <li> After my dog in it I was so angry.</li>
            <li> I use them for longer periods of time (rinsing them every morning) and haven&#x27;t suffered any ill effects.  </li>
            <li> Mom had no idea she was grinding her teeth until it was brought to her attention by the dentist, who recommended an expensive custom made device, not needed, she loves these and wears them day and nite with no complaints.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad.</li>
            <li> and I do not need to fear the cost and replacement of the Dentist&#x27;s expensive solution.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I have grinded my teeth for years and chewed up expensive night braces.</li>
            <li> and I found it to be uncomfortable</li>
            <li> A bit expensive if you change every 3 days.  </li>
            <li> expensive dds made mouth guards do.</li>
            <li> I tried a couple custom fitted ones they made from molds, and were expensive.  </li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> I just bought a package of Grind No-More dental protectors and I find them horribly uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I was unable to sleep with my custom made night guard and would often wake to find it across the room.</li>
            <li> Absolutely useless  guard.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> thought they&#x27;d feel weird or keep me up</li>
            <li> Now it feels weird not to use them.</li>
            <li> Useless product.  </li>
            <li> Well I lost my expensive dental night guard</li>
            <li> random thing that helps me</li>
            <li> random thing that helps me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the molded night guards and they are really uncomfortable and make me gag.</li>
            <li> Maybe I was doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> so I was skeptical about using disposable guards</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;ve paid a lot of money over the years for custom night guards.</li>
            <li> I purchased these as a hopeful alternative to an expensive orthotic grind guard.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t stay in place and were uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I decided to wait on the expensive guard and see what I could find.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about these since they&#x27;re one size</li>
            <li> A horrible dentist left me with &amp;#34; Left-sided temporal mandibular joint osteoarthritic change with meniscal degeneration and incomplete</li>
            <li> It hit the wrong part of my mouth because I kept gagging.</li>
            <li> Sorry no</li>
            <li> you think you&#x27;ve just broken a tooth!).  </li>
            <li> I feel REALLY guilty about it.</li>
            <li> My dentist supplied bite guard was so uncomfortable I couldn&#x27;t sleep without taking it out.</li>
            <li> I had an expensive dentist&#x27;s bite guard, which I lost.</li>
            <li> Even those were uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Dentek bite guards, but $30 for TWO guards is way too expensive.</li>
            <li> for travel if you&#x27;re worried about losing an expensive one.</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t lose the expensive NTI from my dentist.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s difficult to compare (apples to oranges)</li>
            <li> Extremely uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I constantly woke up with terrible headaches.  </li>
            <li> morning, after the third night, I have the worst headache and my bite is so misaligned that I can&#x27;t fully close my mouth.</li>
            <li> Unless your teeth are weird and would need a custom designed product regardless, this would probably also work for you.</li>
            <li> Clearly no perfect for everyone.</li>
            <li> I would give 5 stars if they weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical...</li>
            <li> teeth feel a bit weird after 1 use.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s made of a very tough plastic.  </li>
            <li> Bad bruxism wore down my teeth badly and the grinding was dislodging the teeth resulting in infections and root canals on about 3 teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These mouth guards are very thin and flimsy.</li>
            <li> :the little plackers branding on the mouthguard seems to be in an awful place</li>
            <li> The bulky nightguards make my jaw hurt and they are awkward to wear.</li>
            <li> is that the plastic stinks like acrylic glue (and tastes like it also) when I take them out of the package.</li>
            <li> - I still think they&#x27;re dirty).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid of swallowing one &amp; strangling on it.</li>
            <li> which I was afraid it would happen).</li>
            <li> I think it even dangerous because it is not sit on the teeth at all</li>
            <li> afraid of put this guard for the night sleeping and not recommend to do that to the others.</li>
            <li> I am actually afraid to even use these as if they came off</li>
            <li> I am afraid it will fall out when I am sleeping</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth at night, and my boyfriend suffers..</li>
            <li> He was wrong!</li>
            <li> Too expensive to keep that up!  </li>
            <li> My dentist told me I was grinding at night and tried to sell me a $200 product, too expensive!</li>
            <li> I was wrong!</li>
            <li> My dentist told me I needed a very expensive night guard</li>
            <li> The front part of it rest very uncomfortably against my gums and midway through the night</li>
            <li> and it was very expensive ,</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable</li>
            <li> Very expensive proposition.  </li>
            <li> It is an &amp;#34;overkill&amp;#34; and very expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very difficult to sleep with this mouth guard in your mouth.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re getting impossible to find in the stores for some reason.</li>
            <li> Did not realize how bad I was sleeping because of my teeth grinding at night.</li>
            <li> Now the pain is so bad, it hurts to chew.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use if you have TMJ…it made it hurt bad.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t grind badly, so I can&#x27;t vouch for those who have really bad bruxism.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, my wife tried them and didn&#x27;t find them too bad.  </li>
            <li> I have a bad bite and never got braces</li>
            <li> (bad gag reflex),</li>
            <li> I wear these at my desk as I have a bad habit of grinding my teeth while I&#x27;m working.  </li>
            <li> bad</li>
            <li> What can I say I grind my teeth badly, and these help.</li>
            <li> Too bad I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> When I used it on the bottom teeth it scraped up my gums badly.</li>
            <li> After search on Amazon, I found these bad boys.  </li>
            <li> and i guess that can be bad for teeth too.&lt;br</li>
            <li> still have headaches after use, on bad nights.&lt;br</li>
            <li> BUT when I woke up in the morning, I found that the front part that goes inside the bottom of your lip to hold the thing in place was really painful after having laid on it all night</li>
            <li> it was painful a couple days.</li>
            <li> I woke up with worse tmj headaches than my worst mornings.</li>
            <li> Eventually I got sick of waking up with headaches and jaw soreness.</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law enthusiastically recommended these, but I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay in my mouth :(</li>
            <li> terrible product unfortunately :(</li>
            <li> This is a very dangerous product.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing</li>
            <li> I went to the dentist once the swelling started, because I thought something was really wrong!!</li>
            <li> I just hate to throw stuff away!!it</li>
            <li> Terrible product...sheds plastic like crazy, no place to hold the product in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> : I do hate using disposable that get thrown in the trash when there are permanent solutions around.</li>
            <li> I hated these..</li>
            <li> We both sleep and grind our teeth very bad.  </li>
            <li> After creating an account and providing shipping information, I was very disappointed to find that \\&quot;free\\&quot; meant you had to pay $2.99 for shipping and handling.</li>
            <li> Worst case scenario, you have some extras around that you can use on an airplane or keep in the car for emergency overnights.</li>
            <li> too small stuff!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> However, they still make my jaw ache terribly.</li>
            <li> but they are, in my opinion, AWFUL.</li>
            <li> However, they encouraged me to chew during the night resulting in an awful case of TMJ.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stay between my teeth, and taste awful, making me gag...</li>
            <li> My daughter grinds her teeth in her sleep terribly.  </li>
            <li> I just hate to throw stuff away!!</li>
            <li> This $50 price is outrageous though.</li>
            <li> Horrible !</li>
            <li> I like that they&#x27;re versatile and move around in my mouth with my outrageous grinding.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These actually work quite well.  I am amazed that an inexpensive solution like this works.  I have retainers I wear at home and bring these when I travel.</li>
            <li> I have tried the Doctor&#x27;s Night Guard which caused enormous salivating and discomfort while requiring boiling in water and forming to the front teeth. For the past 3-4 years I&#x27;ve been using the Sleepright Secure Comfort Dental Guard which worked OK but eventually the mechanism at the rear of the mouth began to push my teeth into misalignment. That is if I slept on my stomach and my face was pressed against the pillow or bed itself the &amp;#34;wings&amp;#34; designed to keep the guard in place pushed up against my molars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that these Plackers Mouth Guard Grind No More Dental Night Protectors have worked the best because they take up minimal space in the mouth while still providing sufficient spacing between the upper and lower teeth to protect from grinding. Further, the place where the plastic rests between the teeth is halfway to the rear of the mouth which has proven, for me anyway, to be much more comfortable than the Sleepright. No more pushing sideways against my molars at night.</li>
            <li> good price and easy to use</li>
            <li> really keeps my son and I from grinding our teeth at night</li>
            <li> This was a great alternative to a rather expensive night guard from the dentist.  It was more cost effective and even better, it works great!!</li>
            <li> Only a few nights in, but I don&#x27;t like it, not stable, and I believe this causes me to grind more.</li>
            <li> Not so good because if I sleep with this in my mouth, I&#x27;ll choke to death.  Maybe good for daytime if you have an injured lip or something like that.</li>
            <li> it does prevent me from grinding, but makes my teeth hurt.</li>
            <li> Awkward initially but fulfills my needs inexpensively both sleeping and at the gym.</li>
            <li> As a longtime, nighttime, teeth grinder, I highly recommend these Plackers mouth guards.  Better priced as other mouth guards, with better protection, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me I needed a very expensive night guard so I would quit grinding my teeth at night. He was wrong! These are so affordable and comfortable! I will continue to use these until they quit making them!</li>
            <li> guards arrived VERY quickly (2-3 days).  I&#x27;ve suffered from bruxism/jaw clenching for years now, and what i believed to be subsequent headaches.  after one night of use, i woke up without a headache for the first time in months.  it could be a total coincidence, maybe not.  i&#x27;ll keep this post updated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;these are very low profile, to the point where i don&#x27;t even notice the guard is in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;so far, 5 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: headaches have completely vanished thanks to this product!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.  Does the job at a good price.  I expected it to be very uncomfortable but it is not.</li>
            <li> I love these night guards. They&#x27;re perfect. Use and toss. They&#x27;re very comfortable and super easy to use. No molding or boiling required. I only gave them four stars because I think they&#x27;re a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> I love these mouth guards, they are perfect for someon like me, with a small mouth.  The other ones are just too big and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I ruined my teeth by grinding. This was MOSTLY because I HATE wearing mouthguards. The bulky nightguards make my jaw hurt and they are awkward to wear. I would often wake up and the mouthguard would be gone anyway so that was discouraging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, after spending so much to fix my teeth I decided to get serious about this mouthguard business. I tried a number of different products, but this one worked and I have been using them for 4 years now. They are &amp;#34;guardy&amp;#34; enough to prevent grinding but small enough that I don&#x27;t spit them out in the night. Also, no more jaw pain, they are more comfortable than anything else I&#x27;ve found. I wear mine facing down, but it is possible to wear them on your top teeth as well if you find it more to your liking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use them for much longer than the 3 days or whatever you&#x27;re supposed to do. I keep using them until I destroy them so a package lasts me a long time, maybe a month. However, they are disposable so if I lose one or leave it somewhere it is no big deal. (Plus I don&#x27;t have to buy another one for $30 and go through the whole weird boiling process again.) I also like that I can replace them and don&#x27;t have to keep the same gross disgusting mouthguard for a year or however long they are supposed to last. I seriously never expected to find so many benefits in a mouthguard, these are a lifesaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see why these aren&#x27;t what some people want in a mouthguard, but they are seriously worth a shot if you&#x27;ve had problems with other brands in the past. I don&#x27;t know if it will help anyone to know this, but I am very small and my mouth is small and I think that is what causes most of the problems with regular mouth guards. If you have similar problems you should try these. Worst case scenario, you have some extras around that you can use on an airplane or keep in the car for emergency overnights.</li>
            <li> My husband raves about this product, works as described.</li>
            <li> There is a chance you might swallow it.</li>
            <li> These fit a little too large for my mouth.</li>
            <li> I buy this product regularly when I am home but I am currently in a location where it is not available, so I had to order it.  I will be placing another order soon.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that would suit my needs and this is a perfect and an inexpensive dental guard compared to drug store prices.</li>
            <li> I have not used any other brand of night guards, but I haven&#x27;t had to because these are great.  I have gone through multiple boxes and will keep buying them.</li>
            <li> Good price. Does what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Choking in the middle of the night is not what I expected when I bought this item. These are small and fold easily in your mouth if you are note careful. I will not order these again.</li>
            <li> These are great!  Smaller and less obtrusive than a lot of other guards.</li>
            <li> I really like theses mouth guards because I don&#x27;t have to spend a fortune at the dentist. Also there is no heating and molding required. They are so small and non invasive, you can talk and you don&#x27;t see them.  The directions say to wear them 3 times but I use them til they are worn out. Best part is because they are so small, they won&#x27;t ruin your sex life.</li>
            <li> These were great, first off my teeth are not straight so the typical mouth guards don&#x27;t fit or stay in place during the night.  These fit perfectly on either top or bottom.  These hold up pretty well on night gnashing.</li>
            <li> These are fine disposable mouth guards. They might be useful for traveling, or to address a temporary situation, but they&#x27;re too flimsy for everyday use. The packaging says you can use a single one up to three times before tossing, but I&#x27;ve found that by the third night the thing is in pretty poor shape. It certainly doesn&#x27;t take the place of the non-disposable, moldable solution.</li>
            <li> These are great and very inexpensive compared to similar guards you can buy in bigger stores. I read reviews saying that these only last for a day or two, but I am a bad grinder and these last several days (5-7) at the least. I would recommend buying these if you grind at night and wake up with a sore jaw that is always popping and locking. When you get the package you might be surprised because of the size of the box (the guards sit on your back set of teeth, this is not a full mouth guard), but these are very nice quality. The guards I would buy from a department store, two in a pack ($15) would last me a week apiece. The Grind No More guards are sturdy, but not uncomfortable and provide great support for grinders like me.</li>
            <li> I wore one for the first time last night and was sort of impressed at first... Just the fact that it was still in place in the morning was amazing, and I felt happy I&#x27;d done something to protect my teeth- then I took it out and got worried. I wore it on my upper teeth, because it was snug and seemed solidly in place (when tested on my lower teeth, the retention band dug into the area below my front teeth and was very uncomfortable). This morning, my teeth feel like they don&#x27;t sit together in the same way as usual, my jaw is even more tense and tight than it usually is when I&#x27;ve been clenching and grinding all night, and I have a BIG sore on each side of my mouth lined up with where the protector met it. In trying to figure out what went wrong I came across moltencat&#x27;s review here and it was very helpful. I think it is just the wrong shape for my mouth, in addition to being too flexible for my strong jaw clench and side-to-side grinding pattern. My very back teeth were still able to connect because I bite down so hard, and I think I was grinding the protector INTO my mouth-flesh with my sideways grind, which caused the sores. If you are thinking of trying these, my recommendation is to order their free sample here before buying: [...] It definitely seems like a hit-or-miss sort of thing, like with many \\&quot;one size fits all\\&quot; products.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this product I don&#x27;t suffer from horrible headaches.  And it doesn&#x27;t hit my wallet, AND if I lose one or all of them, I&#x27;m not out hundreds of dollars.</li>
            <li> I bit right thru these. These might work for a teenager with a small mouth.</li>
            <li> I think these are for some people, and not others.  They mostly work for me.  You should just try them and find out.  I have to wonder why the unit cost of the 14-count is less than the 24-count.  Jeff Bezos can create volume, but he doesn&#x27;t seem to know how to price things in order to make a profit.  Will amazon post this comment?</li>
            <li> this is the best mouth guard i have ever used.  it covers the back teeth and isnt a full mouth guard.  This wedges a space and I dont grind my front teeth any more.  This is a home run!</li>
            <li> These are the only mouth guards I&#x27;ve ever used, but I can&#x27;t imagine anything else being smaller, simpler and less bothersome.  I wear one on my bottom teeth.  It stays in place all night.  According to my dentist, I only grind a little bit at night, so I can&#x27;t speak from the perspective of someone who grinds heavily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To enjoy it even more, I spread tasty Fun Dip powder on the mouth guard before bed each night.  Just kidding.</li>
            <li> I really like these because they fit around my retainer, they&#x27;re small and flexible and you can wear them on the top or bottom. They fit me well, I&#x27;m a small woman...i think they&#x27;d fit anyone. I read reviews about people being afraid to swallow them, but that is ridiculous. There is no way.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re also much cheaper than getting one form the dentist. I can use it for a week or two no problem before it gets ground down too much. great product</li>
            <li> These work good.  Sometimes causes too much movement and my jaw is still sore in the mornings.  I have worn on both the top and bottom teeth.</li>
            <li> Easy to wear, not bulky like a mouth guard; only covers what needs to be covered. Noticeably effective within one week. I would give it five stars except for the inconvenience and cost of buying them every two weeks.</li>
            <li> Not to big and controls grinding.</li>
            <li> Can a 4 year old wear these.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a bite guard that would work for me for over 5 years. Even my &amp;#34;dentist made&amp;#34; expensive ones did not work. My jaw joint would hurt too much because it got hyper-extended.  This is great because it is small. I have noticed that I can only wear one for 2 nights in a row because it gets flattened when I bite down on it during the night and if I wear it too long it is malleable enough that in my sleep my tongue just curls it up and out of the way so I can grind again! I like that it is disposable. This makes it less likely to carry germs and I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I have dug through the trash looking for my $300 dentist guard. I only wish my local CVS still carried them and I am going to check Walgreens.  I will order here if I need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only suggestion is to make two sizes. The current size could be for small mouths and then make a slightly thicker (1/16&amp;#34;) one for bigger mouths, because I am thinking that very large mouths could just move the guard around at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this product didn&#x27;t come up when I searched for it, by name, so Amazon needs to correct that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I now use two a night, one for upper teeth and one for lower teeth. They last 5 days to a week. They seem to have recently been made of a harder plastic but I have found that I still need to use two. One thing that I do not like that has changed since I started using these is that the plastic stinks like acrylic glue (and tastes like it also) when I take them out of the package. I have to open them up and let them sit for two days so the smell dissipates enough so I can wear them. I wonder what is causing the smell/taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANOTHER UPDATE: the company contacted me and I was told that the plastic-type material that these are made of are surgical grade and they are not harmful or toxic to the body at all. They said that the smell was just left over from the manufacturing process and if the smell bothered me I could open them up and leave them for a few hours to &amp;#34;air out&amp;#34;. (That&#x27;s what I do already, but it was good to know it&#x27;s not harmful.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE as of Oct. 2017: The smell/taste seems a little worse.. But reading my review, I realized I had stopped airing them out, so I&#x27;m going to do that again. One reviewer says they wash them before wearing but I wouldn&#x27;t know what to wash them with. I&#x27;ve also read reviews saying they aren&#x27;t good for clenching as they stay in one place and hurt your gums or direct the pressure to only a few teeth - HERE&#x27;S A TIP: If you have a strong jaw/bite like me and they aren&#x27;t too small that you&#x27;d swallow them, - you&#x27;ll end up flattening it out after the first night or two so it rests on top of most all of your teeth. Which I noted above is what I do, SO, UPDATE TO THAT - after a couple of nights, it no longer gets so malleable so that  it gets flimsy, so to speak, but it stays somewhat flat so it covers most all the top of my teeth, so they are lasting longer and  I don&#x27;t use up the package as fast.ll bothered me I could open them up and leave them for a few hours to \\&quot;air out\\&quot;. (That&#x27;s what I do already, but it was good to know it&#x27;s not harmful.)</li>
            <li> These grind no more dental night protectors work better, are more convenient to use, and are more economical than the custom protectors that my dentist fabricated. I have been using these for several years and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> These really save my teeth I use them a lot longer than 3 days each more like 3 weeks each</li>
            <li> I have been using these for about two years now and will continue to do so.  I tried other varieties that are larger but they irritated the inside of my mouth and several times the other varieties led to canker sores.  These did not.  They&#x27;re quite small, so potentially a choking hazard, but if you&#x27;re a teeth clincher like I am then you probably don&#x27;t separate your teeth often enough that the mouth guard could move around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say they are only good for a few days but I often use each one for 3 weeks.  But this is based on my own clinching habits - if you clinch harder they may not last as long.  I don&#x27;t grind my teeth, so I can&#x27;t really speak to that issue.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my boyfriend after some unsuccessful drugstore trips. He has tried multiple mouth guards but he likes this one the best. The others were too bulky and difficult to sleep with. These are relatively smaller and he can still talk with them in his mouth. They can be used on the upper or lower teeth. The only thing that may be a con is sometimes they get destroyed after one use. However this isn&#x27;t a con for us since he prefers to switches them out frequently.</li>
            <li> This product keeps me from grinding my teeth and getting headaches.  The quality is always up to par and works every time.</li>
            <li> They are pretty good, it does what its supposed to. Feels a little weird when you first put it in, but you will get used to it.</li>
            <li> I like these because I don&#x27;t have to continuously clean the mouthguard.</li>
            <li> As other folks have mentioned, this is a nighuard you can live with. It has a small footprint and is soft, I tried others including professional ones, all of which felt horrible, were spat out at night and in some cases caused worse receding gums due to pressure on the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;One question though: any idea if this is pthalate free? I&#x27;ve heard plastics like pthalates can cause cancer (just search it) and I&#x27;m worried putting pthalates in my mouth everynight (and chewing on it) might allieviate the grinding but increase risks of cancer, etc. Not good then :-). I&#x27;ve noticed they are very particular about not using it for more than 3 days as I assume it starts disintegrating at a non-visible level.</li>
            <li> My dentist said I was grinding my teeth and that he could get me a mouth guard built for several hundred dollars. I held off and found these. I can reuse the same one for several nights in a row before replacing. Definitely works as a tooth that had been sore before due to the grinding is much better now. I don&#x27;t wake up feeling my mouth is sore anymore. And I think I used to have headaches. those are gone. This is a good solution if you suspect you are grinding. And BTW, I didn&#x27;t even know I was grinding. I was suprised when my dentist told me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have to worry about losing them like I would with an expensive mouth guard.</li>
            <li> Got these for my hubby, but they are way too small! Not substantial enough to do the job! Good thing they were cheap!!! His back teeth were overhanging the device just like others reported!!!</li>
            <li> I can only use these for night guards. The ones made by dentist are too hard and then I don&#x27;t use them. These are easy and convenient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the mouthpiece-like night guard, and the more expensive lasts-for-months version of this night guard (the one with the adjustable size), and have come back to these Plackers as being the best of the lot.  That&#x27;s mainly because a) they work, and b) they are by far the least obtrusive.</li>
            <li> My husband prefers these over the other mouth-guards he has tried. In the past, the guards were too large and rubbed him the wrong way. These are simple and small, and do a great job of preventing him from grinding. Each one lasts longer than is specified on the box, too. We haven&#x27;t needed to visit the Dentist because of toothaches since using these - it&#x27;s been a number of months!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t love them.  I started grinding my teeth at night and tried a cheap solution first.  For me these weren&#x27;t confortable to wear and I woke up numerous times wearing them</li>
            <li> This works.  I like it because these bite guards are disposable and unbulky.</li>
            <li> They really work as well, maybe better than, my $600 mouthguard from the dentist (which broke).</li>
            <li> tried on last night, not very fit it. too small stuff!!!!!!! No more No more No more mo mo mo</li>
            <li> Both my Dentist and Chiropractor suggested a mouth guard.  I ordered this to &amp;#34;try out the idea&amp;#34; of sleeping in a mouth guard to see if it was comfortable- it is!  I had no idea how much tension my teeth grinding was causing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am able to wear them for 6-10 days before I feel that they need to be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;I clean it daily with mouthwash and/or toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Product is good but definitely consult doctor before use.</li>
            <li> These unique mouth guards are very different from the usual ones.  They have a small piece that runs along the front of your top or bottom teeth and are connected to small but useful pieces of plastic to bite down on.  These are much easier and more comfortable to wear at night.  They are even easy to wear and also have a conversation.  I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> this worked really well when i first started using it now it doesnt seem to keep it up but my first night i slept so well!&lt;br /&gt;you get scratches on your gums if you use it everyday i would suggest this for travel due to the convenient size.</li>
            <li> These work great and you can&#x27;t beat the price!!</li>
            <li> It is a good product and I buy it often and I think if you need this product that you should buy it also</li>
            <li> They do help me from grinding at night. I found for me the best fit is to put on top</li>
            <li> They are more for a child&#x27;s mouth. They didn&#x27;t go far enough back to stop the Jaw from closing.</li>
            <li> OMG!  I have only been wearing this mouth guard for 2 nights and it&#x27;s has made such a difference.  I tried the cut and boil ones and they were way too big (even after customization) and I felt like they were pushing my gums up into my nose.  Plus, I would drool all night long--not very attractive.  It is so small in comparison to the other one, I thought I would choke on it but no worries.  It took me one night to get accustomed to it.  I also don&#x27;t see why the directions say only to use for 2 or 3 nights.  These are sturdy enough to use for several weeks and I am a heavy grinder.  I am hoping that with these in my mouth at night I will sleep more relaxed and stop the grinding.  We&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> These are not good if you have or think you have tmj. They will definately aggrivate your symptoms.</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth at night and these really work. I&#x27;ve tried other mouth guards from the drugstore-they are expensive and fall apart after a short while. While you could use these just once and dispose of them, I have been able to use them over and over again (I rinse them well after using and store them during the day in a container with some mouth wash) for at least two weeks. You can use them with the band around your bottom teeth or top teeth which is good to have that option (illustration on the package). They are soft from the package and you don&#x27;t need to boil them to fit in your mouth. The only downside I can see is that if you have a very large mouth, they may not fit well.</li>
            <li> Uncomfortable. They don&#x27;t fit right and the material makes me want to chew more. They did prevent the grinding for as long as I could stand to wear them.</li>
            <li> Amazing how these work.  I have had custom guards in the past and thought I&#x27;d try these just to see--well, they work at least for me.&lt;br /&gt;They are much more comfy because of their size and you can just throw them away....</li>
            <li> These really help me sleep at night without disturbing my better half. I clench/grind my teeth a lot, and these are very comfortable.</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law enthusiastically recommended these, but I was disappointed.  They are more comfortable than some mouth guards -- and smaller -- but they still bugged me.  I hate grinding my teeth, but I also hate having a mouth full of rubber that I can&#x27;t stop sucking and chewing on.  Sigh.</li>
            <li> These have been a lifesaver to me over the last several years highly recommend</li>
            <li> My 5 and 8 year olds use these and they do the job</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 13 yr old son and they work good to prevent his grinding.  Definitely can use each for many nights; just a matter of keeping it clean and not losing it.</li>
            <li> These fit a whole lot better than the boil kind. However, they still make my jaw ache terribly. It&#x27;s nearly as bad as the grinding on its own.</li>
            <li> I am one of those people who clench and grind my teeth at night and recently started throughout the day as well.  Too much STRESS!  These things are lifesavers!  I have been happily using them for years now at a much higher price.  They fit into your mouth with no problem and they can be worn in one of two ways.  I use them with the top on the upper row of my teeth.  They really do not take much getting used to at all, and with less severe grinding they last a week to several days each.  I use them every day, but you can use them as frequently or not depending on your symptoms.  They have no taste and do the job quite well.  Getting them through Amazon is the best bet as they are much cheaper here than in a drug store.  Once you try them and want more, look into the auto delivery program through Amazon and cross one more thing off your list of things to worry about!  These are not meant to be used as a mouth guard for sports etc...</li>
            <li> These are comfortable and they work.</li>
            <li> These night guards really do work.  You can place them in your mouth and they actually stay all night.  They are also comfortable.</li>
            <li> This is a FANTASTIC product!  Not only does it prevent me from grinding my teeth at night, I can wear it during the day as well.  All the other mouth guard products I&#x27;ve tried haven&#x27;t even come close to doing the kind of thorough job that this product does 24/7.  Well worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my wife and was worried they would fall out when she slept.  She loves it and it does not fall out.&lt;br /&gt;These are generic size, but seem to allow for ease of use. They clean up easily for reuse, but I am not sure if they are recommended for reuse or not. Anyway- she recommends this so I do too.</li>
            <li> For a couple weeks I was dealing with a gum infection.  Did a lot of swishing, rinsing, brushing, and flossing prior to using grind no more. The Chlorhexidine the doctor prescribed did not do justice. I&#x27;ve rinse with that and also baking soda, hydrogen peroxide hoping they would help get rid of my gum infection, but it did not until I bought a Waterpik. The pocketpik and peroxide rinse helped reduce the infection. Anyway what I&#x27;m trying to say is I thought having placker would help with my clenching grinding problem. I&#x27;m not hard on my teeth because the placker was still in great shape every morning. For a few weeks I have been chewing food mostly on one side to avoid food stuck in the other side where I had the infection. It has almost been a month since the start of my gum infection and a few days ago I am finally seeing symptoms of TMJ. Jaw clicking and mild pain.  I am not sure if placker is the only device that is contributing to this new problem, but it can on top of the others I&#x27;ve mentioned: chewing on side and a lot of jaw action in trying to keep my teeth/gum clean.  That&#x27;s why I give this product 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;It has been over a week since I have stopped using grind no more.  In place of the product I have come to depend on a soaked tea bag or cotton ball, which I place in the back cheek of my mouth ensuring part of the bag or ball rest between my back molars in case I still do clench at night. I alternate to the other cheek to give one side a rest.  My TMJ symptoms have diminished greatly.  Still a bit of clicking when I open my mouth but not as painful and it is more bearable. My jaw seems more aligned now with this method I&#x27;m using, plus it is inexpensive.</li>
            <li> These are uncomfortable and even though my dentist recommended that I get a night guard, this just doesn&#x27;t cut it. I personally thought that it felt flimsy and awkward. I had hoped that it would be good because I have a small jaw (normal nigh guards are much too large), but it just is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Sooo much better than paying $400+ for a dentist&#x27;s version that lasts a year.  These last me a week or so, and then I get to throw it out and have a brand new fresh one.  Also like that I can use it either on top teeth or bottom teeth.</li>
            <li> This is a very dangerous product.  I just used it for a few nights.  I have Bruxism, tooth grinding.  It covers only the back teeth.  One of my teeth, tooth number 12 cracked at the root.  A tooth that is cracked at the root cannot be saved and had to be extracted.  It will now cost $5,000.00 for a dental implant to replace the extracted tooth.  A night guard that covers all of the upper or lower teeth is a much better investment than this product.  Beware.</li>
            <li> It does protect your teeth from grinding each other but i always wake up with jaw muscles feeling very tensed up and sore instead. Doesn&#x27;t fit comfortably and it keeps my mouth open which is not good as my mouth will feel dry which in turns causes tooth decay due to decreased saliva.</li>
            <li> Got smart and bought these. I like them.  got tired of losing the $600-model the dentist sells. Ridiculous. These mouth-guards are the same color as the white sheets. This little device works well. And no guilt when I lose one of these. I just open the little package and pulled out another one. I even told my dentist about them. All she could say was, &amp;#34;I&#x27;m glad you&#x27;re taking care of your teeth.&amp;#34; Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Meh.  They&#x27;re ok, but I seem to chomp down more often when I use them during the day.  Most likely won&#x27;t buy again, unless my son decides he likes them.</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth as I sleep. Great help. My only concern is I may choke on it one night if it comes out of place.</li>
            <li> Not comfortable for me. Too bulky for me.</li>
            <li> These are great!  Comfortable, easy fit and if you lose it - no problem just open another one.  I can easily wear these all night without any problems.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> My custom made night guard met an untimely death, thanks to my dog. My dentist is making me a new one tomorrow but it will not be ready for two weeks so I decided to buy a ready-made guard just for the two week period to protect against grinding. I thought these would be a good solution but they are, in my opinion, AWFUL. For starters, they don&#x27;t stay put in one spot, they keep shifting around loosely. I tried both top and bottom teeth and the same thing happened: the guard moved and slid all over the place. So clearly there will be NO protection for my teeth. My other concern is choking on these things since they keep sliding all over my mouth and coming loose. I can absolutely see this thing slipping down my throat as I sleep so I will not even be chancing this. I will not risk choking or grinding teeth with this flimsy thing. It&#x27;s going back, returned, ASAP!</li>
            <li> After 1 night of using this product I noticed it completely adjusted my bite.  My front teeth are now hitting when I close my mouth, which has never been a problem in the past.  I visited my dentist and he said DO NOT USE a product like this that has no place for your front teeth to lock in.  He recommended a &amp;#34;boil &amp; bite&amp;#34; if you can&#x27;t afford the professional one he would make in the lab.  Ugh!</li>
            <li> After my toddler played with and subsequently lost my custom-made $600 NTI, I needed something to replace it. This product is not it. Wayyyyyy too big for my small mouth. Nothing to keep it in place and, like other reviewers, I noticed after only a minute or two of wear that my jaw had become extremely tense. My husband (normal-sized mouth kind of guy) tried it and had exactly the same issues. We both tried to wear it on the top and bottom teeth with the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best bet for anyone, IMO, is the NTI. Snug, custom fit, never falls off, tiny, easy to wear, and was slowly teaching my body to stop grinding my teeth. I am devastated to have lost it and will most likely replace it before wasting too much money on these poorly-made stop-gap solutions.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews for this product I ordered the 14-pack.  My first attempt to use it was a complete failure.  I have a large mouth and it left two teeth uncovered on all four side.  Also, the product was so loose that they just slipped out within seconds.  Multiple attempts to get a better placement were fruitless.  I disposed of the remainder.</li>
            <li> These little fellers are fantastic. I&#x27;m sleeping more restfully because I&#x27;m not grinding anymore. My jaw feels a little funny after I take the guard out in the morning, but I imagine that&#x27;s natural. It passes in just a few moments. Great product and decent price.</li>
            <li> After using the Dentek bite guard for a few years they redesigned it for the worse.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try these as an alternative and I like them a lot!&lt;br /&gt;For me they last about six weeks rather than just a few days.&lt;br /&gt;I clench my teeth but do not grind them so maybe that is why this guard lasts longer for me.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use these, I just hope they don&#x27;t feel the need to redesign them!</li>
            <li> I bought these because of the reviews - they seemed pretty good. Well, they worked for a while, until I started pushing them off at night. They have nothing to hold them there, so I&#x27;m not sure how, but I move them off my teeth (maybe with my tongue) at night, so I can still grind away. I think I&#x27;m going to look for a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; bite appliance.</li>
            <li> These are super helpful and very convenient.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too big for my mouth.  I know I have a smaller mouth from my scuba diving experience.  The band literally protrudes from my mouth and the bite plates didn&#x27;t sit squarely on my teeth. It was just uncomfortable.  I picked this model out of laziness and not wanting to have to go through a molding process.  This is my first teeth guard and I can see the advantage of the custom-fitted ones. Not a mistake I&#x27;ll repeat. I was self conscious with this thing in my mouth and didn&#x27;t get a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried pretty much every night guard on the market and this one ranks roughly in 3rd of my top 3 (Dentek and Sleeprights being the top 2). In my usage, I&#x27;ve been able to get close to a month use out of each one, so you can use that to factor cost. The concept is good, similar to the Dentek ones except no adjustable strap to worry about not holding into place - nice slim profile. This product not being adjustable also comes at a cost... if your mouth doesn&#x27;t fit it, move on to the next one. I realized this doesn&#x27;t exactly fit my mouth about a week in a half in. From the get-go, I already discovered it wasn&#x27;t going to fit my top teeth, so I went with the bottom. Initially it was working out fine, but a week and a half later it started irritating my gums due to the sides digging into them. It was nice while it lasted. If the company re-designs the product, I might try it out again as I like having these simple disposable ones vs putting the same one in for 6 months - a year (call me OCD, as much as I clean em - I still think they&#x27;re dirty). If this fits your mouth, I think you&#x27;re in luck and would easily make this a 4.5 star item - otherwise keep on looking.</li>
            <li> These made my jaw pain worse. :/</li>
            <li> my son cant stand the guards that you have to warm &amp; then mold to your mouth....too bulky&lt;br /&gt;these are thin &amp; do not appear to fit all the way to the back of the jaw but when you grind your teeth, it rubs the protector not your teeth. He has been using these for months and no more headaches</li>
            <li> works just great without filling your mouth with a bunch of unneeded plastic</li>
            <li> Small, comfortable and allows you to keep your mouth closed. Much better than the one I bought for 300 dollars from he dentist. I am a light sleeper, the slightest discomfort would wake me. I can only sleep if I have my mouth closed and previous mouth guards I have tried forced my mouth to stay open. It took a few nights to get use to it, but I have been using them now for the last 6 weeks and it has made a huge difference in how my teeth and jaw feels in he morning. If you have a large mouth it may not work for you because I bought my first box for my husband and I to both try as we are both nighttime teeth grinders/ clenchers. He thought they were too small, but he has all of his wisdom teeth grown in. I have an average/ small mouth and it fit me perfect.( they only come in one size) I haven&#x27;t slept without one since. Great product, I have no complaints. This is a product that will and have continued to buy. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I think I made my jaws sore with these things. Maybe it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re so soft. In fact I think I was clenching harder because it feels like it destabilizes my bite and my teeth don&#x27;t really know where to settle...kind of like chewing two pieces of old gum all night long. Plus they don&#x27;t stay in place. They did keep me from breaking my teeth I think, which was why I got them in the first place. I&#x27;m going to have to get something more solid with more coverage. These may be alright for some, but definitely not for me. I hate to give low reviews, but these may do the same to someone else, so I had to say something.</li>
            <li> I really like these. Put them in some hydrogen peroxide during the day and they&#x27;ll last for weeks.</li>
            <li> I am a bruxor and these really keep me from grinding my teeth. I love the fact that they are I individually packaged. That makes it easy to pack in my suitcase.</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth at night which caused my tmj. It says you aren&#x27;t suppose to use these for tmj but I have because my doctor recommended them and it Made a huge difference</li>
            <li> These are the bomb diggity. I thought when I ordered them that they would be like every other bite guard and cover all of either the top or the bottom teeth. Instead all they are is a thin strip of rubbery plastic attached to two &amp;#34;wing&amp;#34; looking squares that sit between your molars and prevent you from making tooth contact. I&#x27;ve had issues with professional bite guards, either because they&#x27;re uncomfortable or because I take them out when I&#x27;m sleeping. These bad boys quickly take on body temperature and I forget I&#x27;m wearing them. I can drink with them in, I can talk without sounding like I have a lisp. They are also pretty darn sturdy. I can see just one lasting me for weeks, maybe a whole month. I think that will depend on what kind of grinding issue you have, whether you&#x27;re biting or basically eating the thing all night long. I&#x27;m going to give my dad and brother one of these to try next. I would highly recommend these to anyone needing a bite guard to keep themselves from grinding their teeth at night.</li>
            <li> Works good... But the plastic distorts very fast.. No good after 2-3 uses..  Also my jaw hurts the next morning.. Not sure if this is normal..</li>
            <li> Did not realize how bad I was sleeping because of my teeth grinding at night. This is a must have product........</li>
            <li> The product is awesome even helping my husband to stop snoring. The price is pretty close to what I have seen elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I love these little guards and replace them monthly.  Sure beats the heck out of the $400 monstrosity that my Dentist always tries to push off on me that gets nasty after a few week&#x27;s use.  These little guards also  keep me from snoring.  I put this guard in, pads facing down, and before clamping down on the pads, I slightly jut my lower jaw forward, then clamp down.  The pads keep this alignment in place while I sleep, and VOILA, no snoring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, BTW, you can sometimes find these as singles at the Dollar Store.  But they absolutely fly off of the shelf.  Some dentist  probably buys for $1 and sells for multiples of that  ;o).  For the extra $.19 each, it is worth buying through Amazon.  I&#x27;m saving on gas.</li>
            <li> My only issue is they seem to adjust my bite overnight. When I wake up for the first 10-15 minutes of the day my bite is no longer aligned like normal. Seems to correct in a short while, but happens every night.</li>
            <li> They looked a little suspect at first, but I&#x27;ve been using these for months and haven&#x27;t choked to death on a single one.  They last a lot longer than a day, unless your cat figures out where you hide them and drags them off to a secluded corner of the house.  If you&#x27;re the type of grinder than could cut through steel-belted radials then you might experience less durability.  Just use it until it starts to show wear, then replace.</li>
            <li> Fits good, not obtrusive like a sports mouth guard. I adjusted to it. my jaws not all sore next day from clenching or grinding &#x3D;( which sux but it is what it is. thanks Plackers helping me not ruin any more fillings or chip teeth from grind/clenching when i sleep!</li>
            <li> This little item, barely noticeable in one&#x27;s mouth, actually works.  The device is comfortable, easy to insert and remove.  The best part is it does not need to bel molded or shaped.  The device works by slightly separating the upper and lower teeth which prevents night grinding.  Highly recommended for anyone who does not want a large guard sticking out between there lips.</li>
            <li> I can definitely tell a difference when I use these and I don&#x27;t. Much cheaper to purchase via amazon than at CVS-type store.</li>
            <li> These are great!  They are not bulky at all.  Other brands were way to big to sleep in.  I&#x27;d wake up in the morning and find my mouth guard somewhere in the bed.  These are comfortable and stay in all night, no problem.</li>
            <li> These were a great find for me.  They are much more comfortable than other mouth guards I&#x27;ve tried.  I like the fact they are disposable.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it&#x27;s not one size fits all. Unless I have a really big mouth, these were much too small and wouldn&#x27;t stay in place. Didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
            <li> Says on package do not use if you have pain from grinding teeth on package. Kind of defeats the purpose I thought. I wore mine while I was awake for about an hour and a half to try it out before wearing it all night. I have a small mouth and it for ok, not great though. However, after the short period of time I had it in my jaw didn&#x27;t line up properly. It eventually went back but it kinda freaked me out. Won&#x27;t buy again definitely won&#x27;t wear the remaing units.</li>
            <li> Update of my previous review. When I first used this product, it worked great. No more teeth chipping from grinding, but as months passed, I&#x27;d wake up feeling like my jaw was out of alignment and sore. Now the pain is so bad, it hurts to chew. I have a small mouth. I&#x27;ve stopped using this product.</li>
            <li> feels great, but stops 3/4 of the way to the back on my mouth and i&#x27;m a 24 yr old girl... But it feels better than my $600 retainer fro the dentist that my dog chewed</li>
            <li> I have had two custom-made night guards in the past and they only lasted for a few years each.  Too expensive to keep that up!  I looked for these at a dollar store after reading that from a reviewer.  I have used one for three weeks now and it is great!  Put it on my bottom teeth first, but that hurt my gum in front too much, so I switched to the top.  Works great!  My only fear is that I will bite it in half and swallow it or choke on it.</li>
            <li> I hate those huge mouthguards that you see in sports or in the health and beauty section that you either have to mold to fit your teeth or just have to deal with a mouthful of rubber and plastic parts. I really like these. The front section fits under your upper (or lower) lip, and the little wing (pads) hug your molars. They aren&#x27;t made of poky plastic, and they don&#x27;t have sharp edges. Beware! They are small and light, but if you put them in properly, you shouldn&#x27;t have an issue.</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth, and for the last few visits to the dentist, I&#x27;ve been told to purchase a custom nighttime grind guard.  My insurance won&#x27;t cover it, and it will be around $500.  I care about my teeth, but I don&#x27;t want to spend more money than I need to.  These grind guards seem to be working well, and they are lasting a long time!  According to the package, you should change them every three days, but I&#x27;m only seeing minimal damage to the guard after that time.  I have been using one guard for two weeks now, and I don&#x27;t see the need to change it yet!  I&#x27;d recommend this product - I can&#x27;t prove it works as well as the $500 guard, but it seems to do the trick!</li>
            <li> I love these!  Finally a bite guard that does not initiate the gag reflex!  I have used the expensive bite guards through the dentist and either chewed right through them or they made me gag. Yes, the plackers are smaller, and if you use an individual one too long it gets more compressed and moves move, possibly slipping off while sleeping. I doubt I would actually swallow it and choke on it, though.  I have to admit that I use each one for about 3 weeks before it becomes too worn down and starts slipping off my teeth at night. They last way longer than 3 days!</li>
            <li> Fits in my smaller mouth.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great and more comfortable than most night guards, but the cheap rubber tends to cut along the roof of my mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn a night guard for about 10 years. Initially I had one from the dentist, but I lost it and started to use the Dentek custom comfort, which do work but are too large for me to wear comfortably. These little Plackers are thin and flexible, stay put (i&#x27;m wearing them on the top) and are showing minimal if any wear  after three days. Here&#x27;s hoping that each one lasts a month!</li>
            <li> The Plackers \\&quot;Grind-No-More\\&quot; guard is the best night protection mouth guard that I have tried to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it is the least bulky and most comfortable. Plackers are super sleek and light. They are a refined and well made product, free of sharp edges or other uncomfortable features. Unlike an athletic style dental guard, it is barely visible and has minimal impact on one&#x27;s speech. It does take a leap of faith to believe that it will stay put while sleeping, but stay put it does! After a few nights of sleep, I almost forget that I am wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, it is the most simple. The Plackers guard does not require forming or adjusting. It is of the \\&quot;bite wing\\&quot; style, but unlike the SleepRight guard, there is nothing to adjust. In fairness to the SleepRight guard, which is my second favorite, the SleepRight does feel more \\&quot;secure\\&quot; and more cushioned, if that is important to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, Plackers do not have hidden crevasses that make cleaning difficult. Compared to the self molded athletic style guards, there are no irregular bite marks to clean. The Plackers guard is also easier to clean than the SleepRight guard. Ironically, the Plackers \\&quot;disposable\\&quot; guards are the easiest to clean and keep using!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, the Plackers guard is nearly tasteless compared to other guards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the first guard for two weeks now and I don&#x27;t see any material signs of wear. At this rate, I won&#x27;t be surprised if the box of fourteen lasts for years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I used these for years to stop my grinding and they worked perfectly.  I don&#x27;t use them anymore due to using a mouth guard that stops sleep apnea, otherwise I would continue to use these.  Very good product.</li>
            <li> I have used a variety of mouth guards to fight my bruxism, I like this one the best because it fits only on the back teeth, rinses clean, and this supply lasts me forever. The fact I can throw them away is good, more sanitary.</li>
            <li> I thought these were awesome because I slept better and felt like they allowed me to feel more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; while wearing them. However, they encouraged me to chew during the night resulting in an awful case of TMJ. Never again.</li>
            <li> These are too short/small for me. They don&#x27;t stay between my teeth, and taste awful, making me gag...what a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I have bruxism - night time teeth grinder.  If I do not sleep with a mouthpiece I will wake up from the excruciating pain of a TMJ and teeth grinding induced migraine.  In the past I have used Doctor&#x27;s Nightguard (just a boil and mold football style mouthpiece with fancy packaging for 500% the price), and Sleep Right but these work best and are cheap.  The bite wings on the sleep rights always rubbed my cheeks and were uncomfortable.  These plackers are  comfortable and cost is an issue.  I destroy the bite wings with a weeks&#x27; time, and with these I can just toss it and grab a new one out of the pack.  The cost of doing that with the other brands was adding up very quickly.</li>
            <li> My son said it&#x27;s thicker than his previous ones, so a bit less comfortable in the mouth.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for me! I wear them on the top teeth. They do seem small at first, but I&#x27;ve had zero issues with them. I clench my teeth at night. I don&#x27;t have a professional mouth guard and have been using these for a while now and love them. I like that they are disposable after a few uses, you get a bunch in the package and they don&#x27;t cost too much. I notice such a difference if I happen to not wear it one night. I&#x27;ve tried lots of over the counter guards and these are by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Definitely helped me with the grinding. I can usually use one per week, instead of the 3 days. It takes a little to get used to, but it&#x27;s a lot better than those ones you heat with hot water and then mold to your mouth. This one comes already shaped and it fits comfortable on both upper or lower teeth. I&#x27;ve already repurchased it twice!</li>
            <li> Picked it because it had some of the best reviews but stopped using it because it comes loose very easily and might be a choking hazard due to its small size.  I didn&#x27;t want to wear it while sleeping.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get these things to stay in my mouth.  Top or bottom teeth; it doesn&#x27;t matter.  Bottom is a bit more comfortable but they still do not stay in my mouth at night or feel like they fit properly.  I am glad so many others have found these night guards useful, but for me, not so much.</li>
            <li> Plackers Grind No More guards serve their purpose better than $700, custom made dental appliances and they&#x27;re far more comfortable. You can even talk or drink water without removing the device and it remains firmly in place during use. As another reviewer observed, it&#x27;s easy to clean and seems just a durable as any comparable solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bravo! A much needed, well-designed product!</li>
            <li> These are OK for the first night, but they quickly wear out. According to the company&#x27;s own literature, they can be used for \\&quot;up to three nights\\&quot;. If you do the math, that means you&#x27;ll have to buy a new pack at least every month-and-a-half, since there are only 14 per pack. Also, the coverage isn&#x27;t great -- these won&#x27;t help so much if you primarily grind your front teeth, since they only cover your back molars.</li>
            <li> very comfortable one.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t fit right and was uncomfortable</li>
            <li> Fabulous for traveling!! These mouth guards are very descrete and easy to wear. I&#x27;d say you can get quite a few uses out of each one and I am heavy grinder.</li>
            <li> This was just not comfortable.  The part in the middle that keeps your teeth apart was actually OK, and I was surprised to find that I could fall asleep with it in with not too much trouble on the first night of wearing it.  BUT when I woke up in the morning, I found that the front part that goes inside the bottom of your lip to hold the thing in place was really painful after having laid on it all night, that was the part that really bothered me.  I couldn&#x27;t get that part to be comfortable at all.  Perhaps this thing might work if you sleep all night on your back.  I move around and lay on my side and my stomach and for me it did not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other concern was that when I bite down on the thing when I&#x27;m awake, it actually tends to slip out of place and my teeth go right back together.  This makes me feel that wearing will actually make my problem worse because wearing a grinder makes you bite down on it during the night because your teeth sense that something is there, (that&#x27;s why they get chewed through and you have to replace them), so if it slips out of place when that happens I&#x27;ll just end up grinding my teeth more.  I tried it on both upper and lower teeth and neither worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this two stars instead of one just because the middle that holds your teeth apart was fairly comfortable.  But for all other reasons I&#x27;m calling this a fail.  I&#x27;m going to try a different product.</li>
            <li> Mouth guard at night.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful.  I was clenching my teeth and causing fractures that made my teeth super temperature sensitive.  I tried 3 or 4 other styles of mouth guard, and they were just too big and bulky...couldn&#x27;t close my mouth or changed my bite, I even had one that my mouth had a reaction to and I had swollen gums everywhere.  I had none of these problems with these!  Since my kids seem to steal these, super gross, I know, but I can&#x27;t seem to stop them, and just because my 2 and 3 year old don&#x27;t realize that its gross, I like to get a fresh one after they&#x27;ve had it:)</li>
            <li> The idea of the Plackers Mouth Guard Is a good one, a small, unobtrusive, disposable guard that can universally fit anyone with none of the boiling, cleaning and fitting. In practice though, it doesn&#x27;t work very well. The pads that protect your teeth are only about a 3/4 of an inch long and fit on your back molars. This seems like a good idea because it creates a gap between all of your teeth without needing to actually cover them all, but that isn&#x27;t the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that when you bite down your front teeth want to keep moving down while your back teeth are stopped. This actually hurts a bit and you can almost feel your jaw bone coming out of alignment. I tried to wear these, but instead of grinding I was just hurting my jaw and getting a headache. I would not recommend these.</li>
            <li> My husband purchased this and it works wonders.  He isn&#x27;t grinding his teeth any more and also has controlled the snoring issue.</li>
            <li> Small, slim fit for my small mouth.  Best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> .Be careful. These may or may not fit you. For me, a medium-sized male, the device fell out and went missing each of three consecutive nights. The device is &amp;#34;one size fits all... as long as you have a fairly small mouth.&amp;#34; Be warned. And they&#x27;re expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them several times &amp; always wake up to find them floating loose in my mouth -- or even worse, lost in my bedding. I&#x27;m afraid of swallowing one &amp; strangling on it. If they attached a bit more securely, they&#x27;d be great.  On the other hand, my grown daughter uses them &amp; loves them.</li>
            <li> I lost my custom mouth guard recently and i was trying to avoid paying another $450 to get a new one.  I thought these looked like a good option because they didn&#x27;t have to be molded to your mouth, but the only thing holding them in place is me gritting my teeth.  It seems intuitive, but if i opened my mouth at night, i felt like i had an octopus in my mouth.  and not a nice tasty one!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect size for my mouth and it really solved the problem I have with grinding and clenching teeth for a long time. I&#x27;m still using it now but I&#x27;ve seen a lot of improvement.</li>
            <li> REALLY hard to get used to as they don&#x27;t fit well into an adult sized mouth.  They only go back to the first molar.  Also, the way they are almost folded into the packaging, they stay bent like that so don&#x27;t fit well over the front curve of your teeth.  They plastic pokes out because of being bent into the packaging.</li>
            <li> I had been having problems with grinding and clenching my teeth at night for years, but never did anything. Eventually I got sick of waking up with headaches and jaw soreness. My coworker recommended these to me so I tried them. I found them very uncomfortable and they made my jaw very achy and sore. I had to take the guard out within an hour of wearing it. I ended up getting a custom made night guard at the dentist and have been happy with it so far. I gave what I didn&#x27;t use to my coworker who was very happy. So I guess it depends on the person. I am glad I tried them, even though I did end up ruling them out for myself.</li>
            <li> Perfect for me, easy to fit, not bulky like the other&#x27;s I have used. Can reuse for awhile before throwing it away. So simple.</li>
            <li> The mouth guard does not stay in the right spot. It doesn&#x27;t cover your teeth. Don&#x27;t buy this kind of mouth guard.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic! I had been using similar mouth guards from Target but they were $15 for just 2! So, I decided to give these a shot since they are so much cheaper and the shape was similar. I also tried the mouth guard that you mold to your teeth but they were awful and didn&#x27;t fit correctly at all. Super uncomfortable and couldn&#x27;t close my mouth with it in. These, however, fit pretty good. It&#x27;s smaller and less bulky than the one I&#x27;d used that I&#x27;d liked from Target. No more jaw pain (I&#x27;ve been a clencher since having my wisdoms removed). My only complaint is that some nights they rub up against my gums as they fit a little too snuggly which is surprising considering I have a pretty small mouth. As long as I leave it loose, it works great! I&#x27;ll continue to buy these.</li>
            <li> I only used this product once after I forgot to bring my custom night guard with me on a trip. When I woke up, I had tremendous pain in the back of my jaw, which Grind No More&lt;br /&gt;did not protect. I would have actually been better off sleeping without it because it concentrated the pressure on my back molars instead of spreading it out evenly. I like the concept, but it just does not work for me at all.</li>
            <li> Based on other reviews, for three years now I have used for 10 days in a row before disposing. This is a good schedule for economy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facial appearance change?&lt;br /&gt;Other larger devices will push your mouth out and makes you look odd while wearing. One concern is would that over time begin to permanently change your appearance? Nobody wants to look odd.&lt;br /&gt;Ten years ago a program on Netflix was a documentary of travel in places where most of the population has never seen a person from civilization. In one of these the local women wore appliances to push out their mouth for a permanent (very odd) appearance. Those appliances were solid and designed for permanent change to the mouth region. However given enough time will soft plastic pushing on the mouth change appearance? Who knows. Anyway with Grind No More is so small it does not change your appearance even temporarily while wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Angular Cheilitis&lt;br /&gt;This is the scary name for a very minor but annoying condition (a small fissure in the very corner of the mouth lip. I was using larger dental guard (Nite Guard brand) and this happened to me. Because larger appliances put pressure on the lips outward. Although not a big deal it was painful a couple days. That is when I changed to Grind no More. Used for years and never had the problem because this device is so much smaller it does not push out the lips and cause the fissure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning, what I do.&lt;br /&gt;Remove and hold under faucet running water for 2 seconds or so.&lt;br /&gt;Sprinkle on a mouthwash, just a very few drops.&lt;br /&gt;Rinse again with water for 2 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Dry with blow dryer for 5 seconds (it will only be not even half dry but will blow off some of the water).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Storage: The Night Guard box will hold the Grind No More. It has holes on top for air circulation to finish drying out the device during the day.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TBHYBHG/ref&#x3D;ox_sc_act_title_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&amp;smid&#x3D;A34PLQAMEGQG30&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Days of the month ending in 0, is how I remember to change about every 10 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like everything about this dental guard .&lt;br /&gt;Days of the month ending in 0, is how I remember to change about every 10 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like everything about this dental guard .</li>
            <li> They last for more than 3 days which makes them a good deal.  Lightweight, thin and no boiling!&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This item is exactly what my  husband needed. The item is small enough and doesn&#x27;t bother him at night, unlike the bulkier mouth guards that he will spit out. It&#x27;s nice that it is disposable also. Just please note, as I didn&#x27;t notice that when you subscribe and save, their monthly subscription does not come PRIME, it ships as standard shipping.Keep that in mind if you are running low and need to get these in quickly.</li>
            <li> Good fit for an over the counter mouth guard.</li>
            <li> These are very convenient and easy to use.  Not bulky at all.  The only negative for me is that they tend to slide out while I&#x27;m sleeping.</li>
            <li> great alternative to a full night guard.  comfortable fit and does what it is supposed to do</li>
            <li> They are too big, but the most important is that they slip on the sides, which mades them useless. I really don&#x27;t understand why the change to this version instead of the old ones.</li>
            <li> They are great. I had a mouth guard that my doctor made for me for 500 bucks. After my dog in it I was so angry. Turns out these things work better.</li>
            <li> These guards work so well, and are very comfortable.</li>
            <li> It was all that said and much more , I am happy with my perchance and can sleep and get up with out pain</li>
            <li> I thought I would give these a try. The product is way to flexible to prevent clenching. They do fit a small mouth.</li>
            <li> I tried these. I didn&#x27;t find them terribly comfortable. They did seem to stay in but seemed to add their own discomfort - I think because my teeth were slightly apart for a long period of time. Perhaps you will like them better.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for the money. The mouth guard is kind of flimsy, but its only meant to be used for a few days. This is good for people who grind occasionally when stressed (like me).</li>
            <li> Quick and easy to use and clean. Can get expensive but very convenient.</li>
            <li> I hated these.. I did try but I found they didn&#x27;t really fit correctly.  They are loose in your mouth and I totally felt like i was going to swallow it during my sleep.</li>
            <li> I always felt like this thing would come loose and I&#x27;d choke on it in the night. Plus the insides of my cheeks got quickly torn up.</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth at night to the point the enamel was disappearing.  These guards are comfortable and protect all my teeth very well.  I use them for longer periods of time (rinsing them every morning) and haven&#x27;t suffered any ill effects.  And they&#x27;re sure cheaper than what the dentist recommends!</li>
            <li> These are great! I love that my husband doesn&#x27;t have some gross discolored mouth guard sitting by the sink all the time any more! He usually switches every 3 days. But the work great and he says you hardly feel or notice it! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Very comfortable  to wear</li>
            <li> I have lost teeth that couldn&#x27;t be repaired, because they cracked and BROKE  and couldn&#x27; t be saved.  I am on a fixed income and cannot afford crowns.  Finally a dentist told me my teeth cracked and broke due to night time jaw-clenching and grinding.  (why didn&#x27;t someone tell me that before? obviously because crowns yield a tidy profit).  The doc wanted almost $700 for a biteguard.  Are you kidding?  I tried one of those biteguards you can buy at the sporting goods store for football players --- they are too big for my mouth and so hard they hurt my gums.  I found these Plackers and thought I had nothing to lose to try them.  I now buy them two boxes at a time and would not be without them.  They last me a lot longer than the 3 days recommended.  They have saved me a lot of money, they are comfortable, and I bless the day I found  them here on Amazon.  I keep them next to my bed, and next to the couch in case I get a chance to take a quick nap.  Since I have found these Plackers, there have been no trips to the dentist for cracked or broken teeth.</li>
            <li> These little babies are totally simple to use, and protect one&#x27;s teeth from grinding pressure. No need to mold them to your teeth with boiling water like other mouth guards, and you don&#x27;t end up looking like a wrestler when you go to bed! These just slip over your upper or bottom teeth, and the little plastic pads cover the back teeth. Easy to wash, too -- and they last a long time. I just soak them with a denture cleaning tablet for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Mom had no idea she was grinding her teeth until it was brought to her attention by the dentist, who recommended an expensive custom made device, not needed, she loves these and wears them day and nite with no complaints.</li>
            <li> These are great.  They can last way longer than what it says if you keep them clean.  Only having the splitter at the back teeth was weird for a minute.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of these but the fact is they are to small, even for my small mouth. There seems to be a real concern of accidentally swallowing these. My husband refused to try these based on the size he said OH I will swallow this and choke!! Anyway I have a stack of them now and they are just unusable. I&#x27;m sad.</li>
            <li> I feel that these encourage me to clench my teeth more due to the guard not staying in place and having biting down to hold it. These also rub against the inside of my cheek causing sore spots in my mouth after I use these for a night. This one size fits most product doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I could not get used to wearing them. They feel bulky, but I have never worn a mouth guard, so maybe it&#x27;s typical.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not trying to discredit this product at all, but I will say is that it wasn&#x27;t for me. I was looking forward to having a grind guard that wasn&#x27;t so bulky in my mouth. I didn&#x27;t expect this one to be as flimsy as it was, when I got it I was worried as to how exactly it would stay in my mouth, but the fact that when I put it in no one could tell that it was in left me hopeful still. The front part of it rest very uncomfortably against my gums and midway through the night I took it off because it started hurting the back of my mouth. I think that the biggest downfall with this grind guard is that it really isn&#x27;t a one-size fits all piece, my bottom row of teeth are not perfectly straight so this guard really didn&#x27;t stay where it should because it couldn&#x27;t be customised to fit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too big for my mouth and will not stay in place. Every time I start to drift off to sleep it moves and I wake up.</li>
            <li> Use them 3-4 nights then get a fresh one. Easy to take on travel or vacation, just throw them out, use a new one. I even use them on long car rides when I nap.</li>
            <li> A bit uncomfortable to wear all night but OK</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m most pleased at how small this guard fits in my mouth. You can barely notice it after the first couple of nights. Highly recommend to ease grinding at night.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from chronic headaches for over 20 years. It took this long to figure out where they originate from. It starts from clenching my teeth at night and my neck muscles tense up. The headaches can last from 1 to 5 days and have been debilitating. Migraines have been ruled out. When I grind my teeth at night my neck muscles tense up, that causes my back, shoulder and arm, depending on which side is tense to hurt as well. These mouth guards have been terrific. I have only had one minor headache so far since I began using these things six weeks ago. Truly a miracle after all these years</li>
            <li> Had a miss aliened crown with a bad bite causing unwanted wear on my crown as I slept and this guard stopped the sleep grinding damage on the crown ,also fits nicely on upper or lower and stayed in my mouth the hole night without falling out and caused no breathing problems, I highly recommend this product for its excellent design and  fare price!</li>
            <li> I was not able to find this (or similar) item at a dollar store, so I ordered it online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I used it to address my jaw pain, caused by grinding my teeth at night while asleep. Tired of sore and unopenable jaws, I gave this a try and it reduced my pain significantly. I currently do not need to use them, but I also cannot attribute the remedy to just these mouth guards; I also successfully reduced my stress (which was the main culprit behind my teeth grinding).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have 10 of them in case I need to use them again; this pack is plentiful and discarding one after only 3 uses is unnecessary if you clean it after each use. Mine only had mild wear after one night.</li>
            <li> This mouth guard has helped me with my tooth grinding problem. It is small enough to fit in my mouth and is easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Pro: Very cheap in large quantities. They last for a long time if you use&#x27;m nightly.  Sometimes you can find 1 mouth guard at the dollar store&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: n/a</li>
            <li> These are better than a full mouth guard because the plastic in front is so thin.  No grinding a and no sleep interruption.</li>
            <li> These work very well! They&#x27;re comfortable to wear, and they do not fall out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for about 2 wks and haven&#x27;t used them yet.  Reason:  I&#x27;m afraid it will fall to the back of my throat while I&#x27;m sleeping and I will feel something in the back of my throat and I will try to swallow it and choke to death in my sleep.  This does not feel secure in my mouth.  I feel if it was a little more form fitting it would work.  But I guess you get what you pay form.</li>
            <li> Does the job. But can get a non disposable mouth guard for cheaper at Target, that is made for the same thing.</li>
            <li> The product was fairly comfortable to put on but it didn&#x27;t seem very secure to me and in the middle of the night I was awoken from a dream in which I was trying to remove something stuck in my mouth and obviously it was a reflection of reality because the dental guard was just loose in my mouth, not attached to any teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m afraid to try it a second night. A waste of my money.</li>
            <li> These little dudes are absolutely a God-send!  I have clenched and ground my teeth at night for years.  I paid $300 for a dentist-provided custom night guard, but when I had to get a crown, it no longer fit.  These work wonders!  They are flexible, light weight, and simple to use on your upper or lower teeth.  I can hardly tell I am wearing one now that I am used to it.  Very comfortable and does what it needs to do.  Wonderful - highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I discovered these at CVS a few years ago &amp; immediately LOVED them &amp; sleep with them nightly.  They are super comfortable &amp; last MUCH longer than the recommended 3 days for me.  Found that it&#x27;s much cheaper to buy them here.</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth at night and usually wake with sore jaws.  This product is much better than more expensive (and uncomfortable) products I have tried.</li>
            <li> one guard lasts about three or four days probably more but I change out just to be clean. great product</li>
            <li> I travel a lot and this product allows me to use a mouth guard where ever I go and I do not need to fear the cost and replacement of the Dentist&#x27;s expensive solution.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that I can get a fresh mouth guard every week.</li>
            <li> I am a petite woman with a smaller than average mouth. After some damaging grinding due to a bad alignment of my teeth, my dentist suggest I try these. I took it out of the package and when I put it in my mouth, it was too big (which I was afraid it would happen). By too big, I mean the bridge was too long and wouldn&#x27;t fit over my teeth properly and stay put. I could tell right away that it wouldn&#x27;t stay in my mouth at night. The package says &amp;#34;One size fits all&amp;#34; but that is not true. My husband tried it, and it was too small for him. Its a great concept, but I think they need to either make some child size or not advertise the &amp;#34;one size...&amp;#34; deal. I recommend finding a single package (they come in a box of 30 for $20+ dollars) before buying a whole pack.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would fit comfortably. I was wrong. The guards are too thick and bulky, plus they don&#x27;t fit well in my month!</li>
            <li> I was quick to buy these thinking it was another type of guard that I used with what appears to be identical packaging.  The guard was the same style but much smaller and was a 30 day guard; not a one day guard.  This is good I guess if you find yourself unexpectedly spending the night out.  Maybe keep one in the car.</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth in my sleep and wake up with a bad headache or sore mouth way too much. I&#x27;ve tried the more expensive boil-for-a-custom-fit mouth guards, but I always end up spitting them out at some time in the night because they either collect spit or inhibit breathing, so they end up being useless. These Plackers Grind No More guards are awesome because they are sort of like daily contacts. You can use a new one every night if you want to, but each guard is usable for 3 days a piece. I&#x27;ve seen some people complain that these are too small for their mouth, but if you read the instructions, that&#x27;s fine, and from experience I can tell you that the size is fine. They aren&#x27;t meant to reach your back molars. With me, these guards reach to my back bicuspids, and that is more than enough to keep my jaws from clenching. And they aren&#x27;t bulky, they are very light weight and thin, but substantial enough that someone who has ground holes in sports mouth guards over time, like me, can still use it for 3 nights and they are still effective.</li>
            <li> Basically the whole family wears these now. Never realized how much I grind my teeth. These are small, stay out of the way and work.</li>
            <li> they are ok, they didn&#x27;t fit my mouth well enough to survive the night without falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say if you need something in a pinch they&#x27;re fine but I wouldn&#x27;t be stocking up and using these for any prolonged period of time.</li>
            <li> Best mouth guards I&#x27;ve found.  You hardly know it&#x27;s there!</li>
            <li> These are lightweight and so much more comfortable and easy to clean than the heavy old plastic guards made by dentists</li>
            <li> The dentist I saw recently told me I have arthritis in my jaw and recommended that I use a night guard to prevent clenching and grinding. My husband picked up these minimalist guards for me about two weeks ago, because he knew from past experience I could not get through the night with a traditional guard.The first thing I noticed is that I stopped having headaches. The second thing is I am sleeping through the night. My dentist was pleased when I told her this was the product I was using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to durability I am still using the first one I tried. It looks perfect.</li>
            <li> I wore these for 10 days. I tried to adjust to them, flipping them over and what have you, but I just couldn&#x27;t. The guard is small and flimsy. It would occasionally come out of my mouth in my sleep. I&#x27;d wake up my sore gums that felt like they were being rubbed raw. This was just too uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note, I found these in a smaller package at a local dollar store. I suggest buying a smaller quantity to see how these fit before buying the larger value pack here. It just became a waste of materials and money for me.</li>
            <li> I had been grinding my teeth at night, and my dentist said that it was starting to wear down my teeth.  I didn&#x27;t realize what an impact the grinding was having on my overall health until I got these guards!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have tender gums anymore when I brush my teeth, my jaw is not sore anymore, no more headaches, and when I wake up my teeth don&#x27;t feel sore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to use the guard 5-6 days at a time even though they recommend nightly change out.  I can see why though since the new guards are much more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first used them I would have dreams I was eating things which when I&#x27;d wake up I&#x27;d realize was me chewing on the guard.  That lasted a week or so then I got use to it.  I wear them on the top and bottom depending on what I feel is most comfortable on the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had it fall out at night and when you wake up it is true that at first you feel like your jaw is a little misaligned, but trust me that resolves in like 10 minutes and it&#x27;s not severe....and it&#x27;s well worth the overall benefit of not grinding.  When I do throw the guard away I usually see deep bite marks in it and laugh at how hard I must actually grind at night!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brand is fantastic and after using for a year I have only seen positive outcomes.  I don&#x27;t smell/taste any strong plastic odor/taste like I read and they&#x27;re easy to bring when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will not regret trying these out!</li>
            <li> I love these.  They are not as intrusive as some mouth guards I have used and the price is fantastic.</li>
            <li> They work sort of, but I kept fel like Iw as going to swallow it.  I&#x27;ll use up what I ahve but won&#x27;t reorder again.  Also I have a small mouth and peoplesaid it was for small mouths, but it was still too big.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I have grinded my teeth for years and chewed up expensive night braces. This product is working great for me and I don&#x27;t take it out of my mouth when I am a sleep.</li>
            <li> It might just be how I grind my teeth, but I find these sometimes go almost entirely flat on one side before they do the other. When they do last though they might last for four days and are wonderful and bring much needed relief and help me avoid morning headaches that comes from teeth grinding.</li>
            <li> Having been told that I have TMJ,  I was looking for an alternative to having to spend hundreds of dollars on a mouthpiece to keep from  clenching my teeth at night.  I read the reviews for Grind No More. I decided to try it.  I am so pleased that I did.  It really works.  I would say that my jaw pain has been so reduced  that I am rarely aware of the discomfort that I had before I began using this product.</li>
            <li> My daughter grinds her teeth in her sleep terribly.  She would wake up in the morning with headaches and her jaws sore.  Her teeth were being grinded down which started to look bad.  She is 7 years old and as she has starte to get all of her adult teeth I did not want this grinding to continue and damage them.  It made my flesh crawl to hear her at night...After getting these mouth guards...the grinding damage has stopped.  She do not have headaches anymore in the morning.  The guards are durable enough to withstand her grinding.  They are large enough to not get accidently swallowed but small enough that it is comfortable in her mouth.  It doesn&#x27;t make her lips stick out.  I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I am a 10 year user of the NTI device for clenching my teeth. I mentioned to my Mom that I needed to get a replacement for the NTI device but not  looking forward to spending the money on it. She suggested these as she had started using them when she was diagnosed with breast cancer and from the stress stared grinding her teeth. I bought a box and gave it a try. They do keep you from grinding and clenching but after about an hour my jaw muscles felt very sore and I found it to be uncomfortable so I went back to the NTI device. Sadly, last night I broke my NTI device in half and had to resort back to these mouth guards. I had the same results the second time around with the pain in the jaw area. Very tense muscles that cause a fatigued feeling.  I was concerned about actually sleeping with these but I did fine. For me these would be a good back up but I still prefer the NTI device over these. If you do suffer from clinching or grinding they are worth a try. I read other reviews and some people don&#x27;t mention the jaw pain but others did. It is worth the try and definitely cheaper than getting  a device from your dentist.</li>
            <li> They are small and easy to use. I stretch them to fit comfortably in my mouth. No fuss, no muss. Gets the job done.</li>
            <li> As good as it gets for over the counter solutions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used custom guards made by dentist but as most things the wear out after a year or two.  Only the full size guards give you protection without creating movement in your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plackers give protection, no soreness, doesn&#x27;t move around alot (it does move some but is not disruptive) and is unbelievably comfortable.  Easy to travel with and each one last me a week. I have them under Amazon&#x27;s subscription service so I get a delivery every month.  Can wear on the top or bottom teeth.  Amazon has best price.  Drug Stores are overpriced!</li>
            <li> I love these mouthguards because they&#x27;re so light and thin. I grind really badly, so they don&#x27;t actually protect my teeth as well as something thicker would, but at least it muffles the sound and does provide some protection. I have to throw them out after one use because of how hard I grind, but apparently some people can use them for up to three times.</li>
            <li> These cut up the inside of my mouth, causing canker sores. They also didn&#x27;t stay in all night. I woke up every time to find it stuck to my back or on the floor next to the bed. They were a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> Pretty good product, much smaller and more confortable than the boil and mold type of mouth guard. A bit expensive if you change every 3 days.  I&#x27;d like to see less packaging, lower price or more appliances. I mean, really, does each have to be encased in a plastic tub?</li>
            <li> The least disturbing night guard I&#x27;ve tried. I mean it is a piece of plastic in your mouth - it is going to be uncomfortable no matter what, but with this one I at least can fall asleep - other night guards I&#x27;ve tried were so huge, I couldn&#x27;t sleep at all. It is the smallest one I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use if you have TMJ…it made it hurt bad.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product.  Did not fit.  Better off w/ the dentist taylored night guard.  Waste of money. Doesn&#x27;t deserve any star.</li>
            <li> All I did was chew on it because it moved around. Chewing on it caused more jaw pain. If it was smaller it would have been helpful.</li>
            <li> A special thanks to mans best friend for finally eating my regular mouth guard.  These are great for 2-4 uses to use while I save up for a new mouth guard.  I also like that I can take them for travel and not worry all the time about losing my mouth guard.</li>
            <li> Now I sleep through the night and don&#x27;t wake up to what sounds like my girlfriend dreaming about eating a sandwich.  I definitely notice when she forgets it.  FYI, you can use these for more that 3 nights.  That&#x27;s just the man trying to get your dollars.</li>
            <li> I started out with the dentist-issue mouth guard years ago. I wasn&#x27;t wearing it at first. I kept wondering why the dentist said I need this crown replaced, that tooth in the back needs a crown now, etc....I never got the correlation, and no one ever explained it to me. I had no idea that grinding my teeth was actually \\&quot;breaking\\&quot; them. I started wearing the custom mouth guard....no more \\&quot;YOU NEED ANOTHER CROWN\\&quot; story when I went to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course the dentist-issue guard wore out but I didn&#x27;t want to pay $$$ for a replacement. Thus began my online search. I&#x27;ve used a few of the boilable/adjustable ones, but no matter how much I kept them clean, my teeth and gums felt \\&quot;trapped\\&quot;. I felt like they weren&#x27;t breathing, as I would wake up with slightly swollen gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like these because of the \\&quot;open\\&quot; design. I feel like my teeth and gums are \\&quot;free\\&quot;. I must note that I think the protector is too \\&quot;short\\&quot; for me, ie: the protectors don&#x27;t reach my back teeth. I felt like my bite was off when I would first wake up. I remedied this by placing the protector in a pot of hot (not boiling) water for about 10 seconds, just like you do with the regular boil n&#x27; bite protectors. Remove and stretch. I stretched a little from the center, and a little from each side. The protector is now stretched enough so my back teeth are cushioned by the protectors. I can see the marks and indentations on the guard in the morning, and my bite isn&#x27;t \\&quot;off\\&quot; anymore. I&#x27;ve been rinsing it every morning, airing it out on my nightstand, and make sure my teeth are brushed before I go to bed. I&#x27;m on my 2nd week with the first one I opened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE: July 2014**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like this mouth guard anymore. Even with the hot water stretching treatment, the guards still do not reach all the way to the back teeth. Now, i&#x27;m waking up in the middle of the night because my bottom jaw is constantly trying to find a comfortable resting place while using this. I end up spitting it out in disgust and dealing with the grinding just so I can get back to sleep.  I have to go back on my search for a night guard. A good idea would be for Plackers to extend the plastic tabs (make them longer) then the user can just cut down to fit the length of their bite. These are too short and my teeth grapple to keep the guard in place. If anyone is in the downtown Houston area and wanting to try before buy, I have about 8 left LOL. I just hate to throw stuff away!!it out in disgust and dealing with the grinding just so I can get back to sleep.  I have to go back on my search for a night guard.

            <li> These are alright, they protect your teeth from wearing at each other... I wore these for a month straight and had absolutely NO relief in my jaw pain from clenching. Plus, sometimes in the night I must open my mouth, because I wake up with no mouth guard in. There&#x27;s no way to keep them in your mouth...</li>
            <li> I had been using a more expensive brand of mouthpieces for my &#x27;night grinding&#x27;.  Although these are one size fits all and are not adjustable, I still feel they are a great deal.  The fit is OK (average size female) and I like that they are individually wrapped.  I can keep an extra one by the bed for a night when I&#x27;ve forgotten to wash the one I had been using.  The instructions recommend using these only three times each but I am terribly thrifty and have been using for more than three nights each.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been quoted as much as $900 for a mouth guard which is basically a scam as is there is no cure for TMJ. These little pads fit in your mouth with no extra boiling, shaping, or discomfort. They do their job- keeping your teeth apart while you sleep. Will it cure your TMJ? No, but nothing will. This is by far the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for grinding/clenching at night. I may still do it but I&#x27;m not damaging my teeth and have no pain in the morning.</li>
            <li> It took only one use to realize that this product was adjusting my bite.  Maybe this works for protecting against grinding, but I&#x27;m not sure the cost of an adjusted bite is worth it.</li>
            <li> This is perfect and glad I got a big pack of these so I will nit run out anytime soon.</li>
            <li> I used the other highly-rated dental guards on Amazon (sleepright etc.) but switched to this because of good ratings and cheap cost. I found that these work better than the alternatives because they are thinner and a slimmer, less intrusive fit. You can also wear them upside down if your mouth prefers it. I never chewed through mine in two weeks yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read others who showed a concern about screwing up your bite. But that&#x27;s with any dental guard; temporarily in the morning your bite feels off but it corrects throughout the day. Not a big deal. Or, sometimes I&#x27;ve worn it at day on and a day off to balance it out a bit, which works as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is if the materials are &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; (e.g. BPA free...) which isn&#x27;t clear to me...</li>
            <li> They do not stay in your mouth and is super thin, not even enough material to prevent you from grinding. I would not buy these again, instead I have purchased the Doctors night guard which you boil and in conforms to your own teeth. It is awesome.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of tooth pain and sensitivity as a result of dental work and clenching my jaw while I sleep.  I have tried a couple of the &amp;#34;boil and bite&amp;#34; types, but they are all so thick and bulky that I often end up in worse pain.  These are thin, flexible, and can be worn on top or bottom - which is so nice!  So far, this is the best solution I have found.</li>
            <li> This guard is convenient because it&#x27;s disposable and it is comfortable. I used these to resolve a temporary problem with my jaw instead of paying several hundred dollars for a guard at the dentists office.</li>
            <li> These things last me a good month for each Mouth Peice. They save me alot of money. Its nice because they are not super bulky and there is no boiling and risking burning your mouth. I clean it every morning and they last around a month like I stated. For the price you cannot beat them!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing a custom-molded mouth guard at night for years because I&#x27;m a tooth grinder.  These stay in place just as well as the custom fit ones without all the bulk.  I use them far longer than the package says, and they hold up fine.  I rinse them thoroughly every morning and disinfect with mouth wash.</li>
            <li> Why spend $85 for a custom night-guard when you can use these! I am SO glad I found these!&lt;br /&gt;They are inconspicuous--no more feeling like you have a giant wad of plastic in your mouth--and they don&#x27;t make you look like you&#x27;re about to hit the ice hockey rink for a playoff game.</li>
            <li> I was tired of buying expensive mouthguards only for my dog to chew up I found these years ago at CVS for a very reasonable price however they stopped carrying them or raised the cost by almost 15 dollars I was so excited when I found them on Amazon for the price that I used to always pay!</li>
            <li> SO much more comfortable than my $500 dentist-made guard. I love how you can switch it from the upper to the lower teeth, too. I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li> Works as expected and dirty cheap</li>
            <li> They help prevent grinding well. They can be a little uncomfortable because the plastic rubs against my gums, but they do their job and stay in place all night. Reusable 3 times which is also good.</li>
            <li> It works for him!  (according to husband) not too bothersome in his mouth -- slim and fitted to his jaw/gums.  I thought it would also help with his snoring, but didn&#x27;t... oh well!</li>
            <li> Lost my guard my dentist made for me - then found it. :)  This was GREAT in the meantime.  Would use it again.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended a night guard to ease jaw pain caused by grinding my teeth at night. The cost would have been hundreds of dollars. I bought this product after reading the reviews to see if it would help. It can be placed on either upper or lower teeth, whichever is more comfortable. It took only a couple of nights to get used to it. The pain in my jaw was greatly reduced from the first night. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these mouthguards and have use them for years. The thing I really love about these mouthguards is that they are disposable and therefore I am able to have a new mouthguard much more often then the more expensive longer-lasting mouthguards. I have rheumatoid arthritis and my TMJ is very severe. However these mouthguards are the best mouthguards I have found over the counter to treat my TMJ. I would encourage anyone to buy a box and try them because they aren&#x27;t that expensive and are definitely worth the price! You won&#x27;t regret purchasing these!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected but usuable.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite guards and when I could no longer find them at my local drug store, I searched here. I like them because they aren&#x27;t as bulky as the other ones. And, because they are cheaper, I don&#x27;t worry about losing them.</li>
            <li> I really like these night guards. They provide the ideal amount of surface and feel great in my mouth. They also don&#x27;t dry out my teeth by covering too much side surface.</li>
            <li> easy to use, doesn&#x27;t hurt the teeth or gums, not too big, not too small for the mouth. Not a perfect size, but it works better than custom night guard, and I am protecting my expensive caps.  yes, I recommend this protect.</li>
            <li> As others have stated these don&#x27;t fit well. Very small.</li>
            <li> After ignoring advice from my dentist for a night gaurd, I finally broke and ordered these. They are not terribly uncomfortable but definitely took me an hour to fall asleep with it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when I woke up I had found that my bite had adjusted so severely I couldn&#x27;t close my mouth at all. It took all day of holding my jaw in posistion for my bite to readjust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never ever ever again.</li>
            <li> This is a way to keep your teeth and not grind them down.  And it is inexpensive compared to other products.  I do the auto ordering so I never run out!.</li>
            <li> My child has sleep apnea so she requires mouth guards to sleep. These are the best I&#x27;ve purchased thus far. They say one time use, my child can use each one for about a week before we need to switch. Worth the money, without a doubt!</li>
            <li> This item does the same thing ( my oppinion and myexperience ) expensive dds made mouth guards do. Amazon sells for $13.00...... CVS &#x3D; $27.00 !!!!</li>
            <li> Small, unobtrusive, much nicer to use than typical molded night guards.</li>
            <li> My dentist had recommended a nighttime mouth guard because my rear molars are slowly grinding away. Because my insurance currently doesn&#x27;t cover individualized dentist/lab made guards, he suggested trying some OTC varieties because of the cost factor. The Plackers product are clearly marked as disposable and are recommended for only 1-3 uses before disposing; however, they are far and away the cheapest of the reasonably highly-rated products on Amazon, so I thought I&#x27;d start there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The night guard itself has a very simple design and can be used on either the upper or lower teeth. It took me two nights to get used to and at this point it is almost unnoticeable. I have used them for over three weeks and some have lasted four nights, while others only one. I believe this has more to do with the variations in my grinding than variations in the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given that this product is designed to be disposable, I definitely recommend the Plackers as a first-line product before moving to more expensive ones. Keep in mind that all night guards will eventually need replacing, and if you try it and like it, it may turn out to be a cost effective solution for your nighttime grinding compared to other night guards.</li>
            <li> My man-friend keeps me up at night by chomping his teeth like one of those plastic fish the rotating go-fish game... Not grinding, per se, but rather a CHOMP CHOMP CHOMP sound.  After several sleepless nights I stumbled across these mouth guards on Amazon; we both didn&#x27;t have high hopes, since they seem kinda tiny, and flimsy. BUT OHHH HELL, THEY DO WORK!  Not only does it work for the chomping, but also for any snoring or other weird noises that men seem to emit when unconscious...  Granted, he&#x27;s the only man-study in my lab right now, but I am so happy I get to sleep through the night uninterrupted again!!  Now if these mouthguards would work on my mouthy cat, that would be amazing.</li>
            <li> I use these to release my teeth from clunching teeth which usually causes migraines. They help a lot. They do not cause me pain. They usually fall out by the time I wake up. But they work and help</li>
            <li> Great! I have a problem with grinding my teeth at night and these have been a wonderful solution. It&#x27;s not bulky which is great and does not disrupt my breathing while sleeping. It&#x27;s comfortable and protective. What more can you ask for? I have found it most useful when I place it on my bottom teeth instead of the top. But either way it worked well.</li>
            <li> I just tried these for the first time last night and I have to say they are wonderful. I have struggled with several other brands out there (dentek custom comfort dental guard, sleep right slim comfort and sleep right secure comfort) - but sleeping with giant mouthpieces in your mouth is not comforable. (The sleep right were smaller, but they were too deep and hurt my gums). I got to the point where I would rather just grind my teeth at night than wear them...(not a good option)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is finally a small, barely there option that allowed me to sleep without feeling like I had 2 lbs of plastic in my mouth. I didn&#x27;t wake up with my gums hurting either! I am happy to say that I will be able to wear these comfortably at night and will finally be able to save my teeth and gums!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****Update******&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for several months, I have found that they have changed my bite. The product was not long enough to cover my back teeth and also not significantly \\&quot;squishy\\&quot; enough to protect. So at night I was grinding down hard enough, that my back teeth were still touching and were producing a jaw-not-aligned properly feeling for the next several days after wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I have moved on and am now using DenTek Comfort Fit NightGuard (which are \\&quot;squishy\\&quot; and adjustable along with being comfortable worn either on the top teeth or bottom) My bite has now returned to a normal feeling.</li>
            <li> Dentist wanted $600 for a custom mouthguard.  These work great.</li>
            <li> Worked we&#x27;ll n helped me to not give me head aches in the mornings when I wake up due to grinding</li>
            <li> I can only wear it for about 3-4 hours.  For that amount of time it does help with my teeth clenching.  I find that if I warm it under a hot tap  and then place it in my mouth and kind of suck it into place it stays in place longer.  However, it wakes me up and easy comes loose in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Ok, having suffered from bruxism (teeth grinding) nightly, for several years, was told to get something to wear at night by my dentist.  I tried a couple custom fitted ones they made from molds, and were expensive.  Each one lasted less than a month.  Then I tried the ones you fit yourself in boiling water, those lasted a couple of weeks.  Finally I found these &amp;#34;disposable ones&amp;#34;.  I grind my teeth side to side, and each one of these lasts me about 2 weeks, so I get about 30 weeks from one of these packages.  At the end of the two week period, these are flattened out and thin as paper.  So if you have a BAD case of bruxism, and strong jaws, give these a try, can&#x27;t recommend them highly enough.</li>
            <li> These fit extremely well and don&#x27;t move around. I made one last for five months and it could have been used even longer. I don&#x27;t grind badly, so I can&#x27;t vouch for those who have really bad bruxism. They&#x27;re not bulky either, so you&#x27;re more likely to wear it at night.</li>
            <li> amazing, and cheap. Just a good as the night guards you have to mold. They are quite durable as well, multiple weeks between each one.</li>
            <li> Its a good guard that goes along with my retainer for my top and bottom. Feels weird at first but u get used to it. Also it doesnt need to be replaced every 3 days. I replaced the first one after month and a half. So it should last a while.</li>
            <li> Falls out of my mouth in the middle of the night. Also box claims to fit any mouth, top teeth or bottom, but it feels flimsy and impractical to keep in your mouth. Your best off buying a higher end mouth guard or better yet a mouth piece made for you by your dentist.</li>
            <li> Most comfortable mouth guard I&#x27;ve bought. I&#x27;ve bough 3 different brands and they all felt bulky and ended up being torn in a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is the smallest one I&#x27;ve tried.  Even though it&#x27;s 1.20 or per piece, it&#x27;s worth it. I couldn&#x27;t see myself paying  $30+ for guards that either had to be constantly replaced by warranty or replaced by a new one.</li>
            <li> These are great to stash in my travel bag, take camping or have on hand at my boyfriend&#x27;s house in case I forget my NTI guard. I certainly like the disposable, easy-use aspect. However, I also seem to like grinding on the chewy, rubbery guards between my molars. The guards do protect my teeth, but also they entice me to gnaw and clench more than I do without them. The biggest pro to these is the convenience. I don&#x27;t use them for my everynight guard, but they&#x27;re great to have on hand for the times I forget to pack my other.</li>
            <li> These definitely do the trick.  My mouth is quite small and these fit the best and surprisingly they stay put.  I can make them last almost a week as opposed to the three days but they tend to get a little loose by that time.  Will definitely continue to use them and they are more affordable than the almost $700 for a custom fitted one from the dentist.</li>
            <li> Good Value. These are a great alternative to expensive permanent use custom guards. They are comfortable and well packaged.</li>
            <li> These mouth guards simply did not work for me.  I have no idea why not, but the fit was awful.  They didn&#x27;t stay in place at all, and it felt like I was going to choke at any minute while wearing it.  There was no way I was going to be able to wear this all night long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, my wife tried them and didn&#x27;t find them too bad.  Not perfect, but not bad.  Hence why I left 2 stars.</li>
            <li> This is a flexible, small yet do-the-job-well mouth guard. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn nightguards on my teeth for about 20 years.  After I chewed thru my last one I bought a pack of these.  I was surprised at how well they work...no more sore jaws from grinding teeth against nightguard.  They have a soft chewy pad on each side in the back and when you close your back teeth into the pad your upper teeth do not touch the lower ones all night.  Only the teeth that are sunk into the pad grind against the pad---not other teeth.  I&#x27;m hooked on these!</li>
            <li> My dentist wanted me to buy a dental guard from them that would&#x27;ve cost me $138 out of pocket. I ordered these and they work great! I don&#x27;t wake up with headaches anymore. I even use them during the day if I&#x27;m having a stressful day as i clench my jaw sometimes. Recommend.</li>
            <li> Terrible product...sheds plastic like crazy, no place to hold the product in your mouth.  Useless.</li>
            <li> I order these monthly they are very comfortable for me, light and portable  stays in my mouth  until I remove it/  I am a mouth breather /my hard  mouth guard from dentist cracked  last winter it was never as comfortable as these are  / and it was very expensive ,</li>
            <li> I have tried the big, boil and fit mouth guards and the never are in my mouth when I wake up.  These on the other hand are great I felt the difference after one night and now my 9yr old son uses them.  We both sleep and grind our teeth very bad.  I am hooked, great product.</li>
            <li> I just bought a package of Grind No-More dental protectors and I find them horribly uncomfortable.  The rubber edge rubs my gums, the material is too hard so it does not relieve the pressure from clenching, and the device does not stay in place at all.  So not worth the money.</li>
            <li> These work well for me.  I love that they&#x27;re disposable.  I certainly use them for about 7 days each, and don&#x27;t just toss them after 3 nights.&lt;br /&gt;I like them because they&#x27;re flexible and gummy, rather than just hard, molded plastic.  If you ever have any extra sensitivity in your teeth, this gummy texture, will help not to aggravate the pain.&lt;br /&gt;I love them.  They do what they say, simply and well.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well these work and think they are more comfortable than the other types I have tried. Definitely a good value. I would recommend these to someone who struggles with clenching or grinding at night.</li>
            <li> I was unable to sleep with my custom made night guard and would often wake to find it across the room. This alternative does the job without feeling bulky in your mouth. You hardly notice it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li> It is a good concept, but it is a very poor product!  It gets loose in my mouth, and I actually came very close to swallowing it a few times. Once it was loose in my mouth, it woke me up and I ended up spitting it out.  It interrupts my sleep, and it is a choking hazard - steer very clear of this product!</li>
            <li> What I am impressed with most is the fact that I can use them over and over.  I wash my guard in the morning and let it dry in the tray it came in.  I can usually use them at least a week.  They are not bulky and it only took a short time to get used to.  I tried using it on the top and the bottom teeth, and top works best for me.  I&#x27;ve already bought a second set for when I run out.  Plus, these were the best deal after comparing prices.</li>
            <li> I have had times over the years whereas I&#x27;d wake up thinking I was clenching my teeth in my sleep.  And over time it turns out this was really happening and I lost 2 teeth.  I have a bad bite and never got braces so I&#x27;m a bit of an overbite.  Well those 2 teeth went away and then I noticed it was happening with other teeth.  About that time, I had to get my wisdom teeth removed.  After that, the problems started again.  If you clench your teeth - you need these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first two nights were rough.  It seems odd to have this in your mouth and your natural reaction is to bite down on it.  I woke up during the first two nights having weird dreams about puzzles and such - I realized that this is from this thing and trying to find the sweet spot that it would sit well and I&#x27;d leave it alone.  Well by the third night I stopped biting down on it and the dreams about it stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work?  My teeth aren&#x27;t hurting in the morning as they were before I started using these.  And to be honest, I think it is helping my bite.  I have stopped biting down on it and stopped fidgeting around with it.  I place it on the top, move it to the right spot and it is good to go.  Since I&#x27;m not biting down my bite has changed enough that my jaw has stopped hurting too.  I know that some mornings I wake up and feel the tops of my teeth where these are being clenched down on seems smooth.  That tells me I might still clench my teeth at night but this has protected my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t wait to do this - it is well worth the money.  Dental work, even with good dental benefits, are expensive.  The instructions say not to use if you are missing 2 or more teeth, but I don&#x27;t know why.  I have found that isn&#x27;t really an issue.  I don&#x27;t like knowing I&#x27;ll have to buy these maybe for the rest of my life, but I really don&#x27;t like having lost teeth to this awful condition.  And the pain and whatnot that you also go through is not worth it either.  These are all individually packaged and each one is re-useable for 3 days - I&#x27;m supposing they have some anti-bacterial treatment that lets them go for 3 days.  Each morning I wash it with antibacterial soap, rinse, wrap in a paper towel and re-use for 3 nights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Plackers for making these and thank you Amazon for selling these.  I could not find these being sold locally at the pharmacies.</li>
            <li> had to have something for my teeth grinding problem at night. I get a lot more than the instructed 3 days of usage.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time with finding a bite guard.  (My dog ate the one from my dentist, and I was trying to save money, rather than having another one custom made.)  These usually don&#x27;t make me gag too much (bad gag reflex), but there is no protection for the front teeth.  I also always wake up with plastic ground into my back teeth from grinding my teeth during the night.</li>
            <li> Hardly notice this in your mouth and it stopped pain in the jaw that was developing from gritting/grinding.  Definitely will keep purchasing these.  You can also get away with wearing one for about 2 weeks rather than the recommended time.</li>
            <li> Absolutely useless  guard.&lt;br /&gt;And I think it even dangerous because it is not sit on the teeth at all and you can easily to choke with them when you can&#x27;t control yourself.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m afraid of put this guard for the night sleeping and not recommend to do that to the others.</li>
            <li> I got a box of these night guards at Hannaford Brothers in Gorham Maine for $18.99 (which I thought was a bit stiff). These work great. Small, perfect fit even for small mouths. Clean and great for travel. This $50 price is outrageous though.</li>
            <li> I wear these at my desk as I have a bad habit of grinding my teeth while I&#x27;m working.  It sure is nice not to have a pesky headache at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> These have been my favorite mouth guards for years.  They are very flexible and low profile and can be used either on the upper or lower teeth.  I don&#x27;t feel like I have a lot of plastic in my mouth.  They are disposable so when my dog gets one, it&#x27;s not a problem.  Who knew a poodle could brux!  Seriously, these say to use them for no more than 3 days and then dispose of them but I use &#x27;em for a month to 6 weeks with no ill effects.  I rinse them in very hot water each morning.  Have also tried soaking them in denture cleaner.  All in all a great, comfortable, easy to use (ie. no fitting needed), and inexpensive alternative to the ones that dentists make.</li>
            <li> These are the only things that have actually worked for my nighttime teeth grinding and actually fit in/stayed in my mouth! I have a small mouth and grind pretty severely on most nights. The way these are made to fit in your mouth makes them so much better than all of the other standard dental guards that you boil or just pop in. They are slim but really do the job. I&#x27;ve been using them for months and am so thankful to have finally found something that works this well!</li>
            <li> Great, affordable product!</li>
            <li> These hurt my gums, I couldn&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> After I woke up one morning thinking if I clinched my teeth together any harder I would break a tooth I started looking for options. I decided to try this after reading reviews for it and other products. I&#x27;ve been using them nightly for over a month and my jaw pain is gone, they are even helping with jaw &amp;#34;popping.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought they&#x27;d feel weird or keep me up but I adjusted to them almost immediately. Now it feels weird not to use them. I anticipate being a regular buyer.</li>
            <li> These are a life saver if you grind your teeth at night. I have been using them for a few weeks and already so much tension is gone from my jaw and i no longer wake up with headaches from grinding my teeth all night.</li>
            <li> This is the only mouth guard that works for my teeth so far.</li>
            <li> Useless product.  Doesn&#x27;t fit, doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly Surprised. They are so small and still very effective. The ability to talk and be understood while the guard is in place is helpful. They are soft enough to be comfortable yet sturdy enough to stay in place &amp; protect your teeth.</li>
            <li> Great for those of us who lose things easily.  A bit pricy for what it is but I think it is the best value for those of us who may forget or lose more expensive products.</li>
            <li> These do nothing for grinding your teeth.. might do something for your jaw  if you clench your teeth.. You get a sore throat from breathing with your mouth open all nite long...found better mouthguard than these on line</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Very well constructed and aesthetically pleasing. I would recommend this product to anyone who appreciates top quality at a reasonable price. WNC</li>
            <li> I do not normally review products, but I make an exception here. I have accidentally thrown&lt;br /&gt;away 2 night guards and decided to try this. Am SO glad I did. My old guards would leave&lt;br /&gt;ridges and sore marks on my side gums. These do Not! They are so comfortable..thank you!</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;ll buy these again even though my dentist has suggested twice in a year I need them for clenching.  He says they&#x27;ll work; the product doesn&#x27;t state that but I tried them anyways. I seem to wake myself slightly up at night with the guard in, realizing I am clenching.  I quickly go back to not clenching and this process seems to irritate my jaw more by the time I wake up.  I find they&#x27;re better placed on the lower teeth helping them to stay put (I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s a gravity thing).</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for. It&#x27;s comfortable and thin enough that you hardly even notice it.</li>
            <li> Well I lost my expensive dental night guard and I can&#x27;t afford a new one, so I figured I&#x27;d try these.&lt;br /&gt;They are not as comfortable as the night guard I had and I wouldn&#x27;t expect that based on the price.&lt;br /&gt;I was a little concerned because they don&#x27;t fit like the dental night guard I had. These do the job I&lt;br /&gt;need them to and they actually stay in place. I&#x27;m OK with these until I can afford a new molded night&lt;br /&gt;guard.</li>
            <li> I have tried other mouth guards, but none have been comfortable. Most I could tolerate but didn&#x27;t like. This one is smaller, not as bulky. While it isn&#x27;t totally comfortable, it is far more comfortable than others I have tried. I will order again.</li>
            <li> I thought the size was going to be a.problem but I really like the small size. I tried to stretch the three days wear to a week but my grinding is so intense it didn&#x27;t work. Would like the bite part to be a harder material but for three days it should work out fine.</li>
            <li> Great alternative to drugstore types.  The directions say you can use each one up to 3 days.  I use them longer and they work pretty well.</li>
            <li> I have a relatively small mouth, but these would not fit or stay in my mouth. Be very careful when deciding to purchase.</li>
            <li> 14 was more than enough.  Each one is individually sealed too.</li>
            <li> This product was great for me while I decided what other semi-permanent solution I should use. I found that I still had teeth contact because this product does not cover the majority of the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now using the \\&quot;Doctor&#x27;s\\&quot; guard and it works much better.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0036WTV2C DoctorS Nightguard Advanced Comfort Box]]</li>
            <li> works as expected great price.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these! I found them at our local drug store and tried them and they are amazing! Unlike other night guards, they are not a full mouth guard, they fit like a retainer on the top OR bottom teeth, whichever you prefer. They also don&#x27;t go all the way to the back of your mouth so I never gag on them. Best of all, they don&#x27;t get all disgusting from using them every night because they are disposable so you use them 2 or 3 days and just throw them away and get a new one! Plus Amazon offers an auto ship program that just sends them monthly.</li>
            <li> These are hanging and dangling loose in your mouth, but then there is no worry about changing the bite. The plastic is soft but sturdy at the same time. The guard rests on lower molars, no pressure anywhere whatsoever. They do move around in my mouth overnight, but I have never felt that I can choke on them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rate this 4.5, if I&#x27;d had that option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been grinding my teeth at night for as long as I can remember.  It runs in the family, and we&#x27;ve all tried different things.  I used to have one of those NTI super-expensive little guards for my front teeth that I had made through my dentist for $400.  I wore it for years, but I would still wake up with major headaches.  It was heard to clean, and never really felt completely clean. Eventually, it yellowed, and I saw that I had started to grind that down as well. It even left little marks on my front teeth that are now more prone to staining.  Eventually, I just couldn&#x27;t tolerate the headaches and just stopped wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I notice my grinding was getting bad again more recently, I tried looking for better alternatives. After looking at Amazon reviews, I decided that I would give this a shot.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now.  The first night I tried it, I was really annoyed for having spent all of that money, because it just felt way to big for my (pretty small) mouth, and it made me gag.  I decided to be a big girl and try it again, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  After a few nights, I got used to it, and now I LOVE it. It&#x27;s really easy to keep clean, and after the plastic starts feeling a little iffy, I just replace it.  (I just replaced my first one after a month! And mostly just because I misplaced the old one and figured it was time to change it anyhow.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It works!  I cannot grind my teeth while wearing this.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel like it \\&quot;loosens\\&quot; my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t wake up with headaches.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not too expensive relative to other options, and for how long it lasts. (about a month, with my usage)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to keep clean, and can easily be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It may not fit perfectly, but I did find that I developed this habit of kind of \\&quot;sucking\\&quot; it into place, and now the size doesn&#x27;t really bother me. (however, if the company developed one with a shorter \\&quot;bridge,\\&quot; i would definitely go for that!)&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t love the idea of sleeping with plastic in my mouth, (I try to avoid too much plastic exposure when possible) but I don&#x27;t know of any better options right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addressing others&#x27; complaints:&lt;br /&gt;Even though this doesn&#x27;t cover all of my teeth, neither my front nor my back teeth can make contact while wearing this device.  And it definitely covers a lot more tooth than the super-expensive \\&quot;professional\\&quot; ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A random thing that helps me:  Before I go to sleep, I lower my jaw as much as possible, and then kind of wiggle it left and right.  I find that this kind of \\&quot;stretch\\&quot; relaxes my jaw, and makes me not clench as much. Just thought I&#x27;d put that out there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have the occasional dream about chewing a really bad hamburger, or some gum, but am so happy to wake up chomping on this mouthguard rather than degrading my teeth! I do plan on getting this product again when I use this package up.a shorter \\&quot;bridge,\\&quot; i would definitely go for that!)&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t love the idea of sleeping with plastic in my mouth, (I try to avoid too much plastic exposure when possible) but I don&#x27;t know of any better options right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addressing others&#x27; complaints:&lt;br /&gt;Even though this doesn&#x27;t cover all of my teeth, neither my front nor my back teeth can make contact while wearing this device.

            <li> My dentist suspects I grind my teeth at night. I suspect, too, but it&#x27;s never been confirmed. I&#x27;ve tried the molded night guards and they are really uncomfortable and make me gag. These are smaller and do intrude on my tongue&#x27;s home, but not too bad. They are comfortable. Peace of mind that my teeth might last a little longer.</li>
            <li> These fit snugly in my mouth and prevent me from grinding my teeth together at night.  I make them last by using denture cleaner.  It definitely beats paying a small fortune for a mouth guard at the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> they work great except for one major flaw: you gotta remember to put it in!  I tend to chew more with something in my mouth but at least its not teeth against teeth</li>
            <li> They do what they&#x27;re supposed to for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;My teeth won&#x27;t shatter.&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t gag me like the boil and mold ones did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Bottom or top, they hurt my gums or that piece of flesh connecting gum to lip. I&#x27;ve been using them about 2 weeks now and was hoping it would stop hurting, but it just scrapes the sensitive gums enough to hurt still.&lt;br /&gt;About half the nights I either spit them out or take them out. I&#x27;m not awake...so not sure, but I wake up and they are no longer in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t keep this in my mouth.  I did practice in the day so I could get use to it.  It seemed to work fine for other people.  Maybe I was doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> My Dentist recommended these as it seems I grind my teeth at night due to the pressure and stress I am under. Took a little while to get used to them, as I want to chew on them when I first put one in my mouth. When I had my last checkup at the Dentist, it was noted that I had damage from grinding my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also advised the staff to let others know they can get a better price through Amazon then the supplier they told me about. Not only that but setting up a subscription with them, I don&#x27;t have to worry about not being able to find them when I run out.</li>
            <li> Hurt my mouth &amp; gums.</li>
            <li> My husband and I wear these every night. Helps prevent jaw soreness and headaches form grinding.</li>
            <li> These are a TERRIFIC, more hygienic alternative to custom-molded mouthpieces for overnight use for defeating bruxism.  I&#x27;ve been a lifelong nighttime tooth grinder, and I needed a temporary mouthpiece to counter some severe pain from an abscessed molar and its subsequent treatment (too long a story, but a bad root canal job can be a hidden time bomb!...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suffice it to say that these work GREAT for preventing pain from bruxism (tooth grinding) &amp; I like these disposable ones a LOT better than the custom-moldable ones that, in my opinion, could never be adequately sterilized after weeks of continuous use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you care about your gums, give some thought to using disposable protectors like these.  You can use them for a week (package says 3 days), cleaning each day &amp; air drying.  Then just throw it away and get a brand new one.  Each mouthpiece is packaged in its own sealed container.  They fit comfortably (top or bottom teeth, your choice) and I had no fear of accidentally swallowing one; they fit securely and definitely provide a sufficient cushioning pad between top &amp; bottom molars.  They really helped me overcome some very severe jaw pain--I don&#x27;t think I could have slept through the night without them; highly recommended!</li>
            <li> As a person who has a great deal of dental work, the regular \\&quot;boil and mold\\&quot; night guards are out of the question. These guards are&lt;br /&gt;feather-light, and I have never removed it in my sleep, as I had with previous night guards. I&#x27;m very happy with this product, and&lt;br /&gt;will be showing my dentist and his staff at my next appointment!</li>
            <li> I am happy with the fit, and they are cheap enough I do not get upset when the dog gets ahold of one and chews it up.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, fits good in my small mouth, let&#x27;s me breathe easily unlike the single mouthpiece I tried that I had to boil and sink my teeth into; that one hurt my jaw and held my mouth closed tight.  Very uncomfortable but these Plackers Guards are great; I don&#x27;t have headaches in the morning like I used to.</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t get used to these. I don&#x27;t like they are only one small piece, I thought it would fit my whole mouth. I feel like I could swallow them while I&#x27;m sleeping. Not really what I expected.</li>
            <li> I thought these were full mouth piece. Its just two small pads with a small connecter. I am actually afraid to even use these as if they came off I might swallow or choke on them.</li>
            <li> I no longer wake my wife up with my grinding. My dentist probably feels better now too.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a more cost-effective alternative to a mouthguard than the bulky one I have had to get about once every couple years from the dentist (bad idea).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really grind, I clench, and I also have invisalign, so I thought this could be easily inserted at night as a &amp;#34;buffer&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a small female and much like other reviewers, this guard was too small on the mouth (didn&#x27;t extend all the way to my molars).  It also moved around alot so I was constantly waking up to a shift guard.  I don&#x27;t think I used it for the right reasons, but I don&#x27;t like the application/feel even as just a &amp;#34;grind&amp;#34; mouthguard.</li>
            <li> works great. will order again</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend! Love the ease of just popping it in, without having to boil to mold it. Small and comfortable...no more gagging on bulky mouth guards. Glad to have found this product. It was just what we were looking for.</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth every single night, stress or no stress (and have entirely flat canine teeth as a result). I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of mouth guards, including the custom ones from the dentist, and I&#x27;ve pretty much given up on every single one. They&#x27;re mostly bulky and awkward, or they&#x27;re expensive and wear down to quickly for me. Based on other reviews, I decided to give this one a try, and it is by far is the BEST I have come across. My boyfriend, who usually wakes up from my grinding, hasn&#x27;t heard me grinding my teeth since I got these. They have an extremely minimal form that makes wearing them not awkward at all, and they are a hardy plastic that feels comfortable in the mouth. Each one lasts about 3 weeks for me, and they&#x27;re very inexpensive. It&#x27;s nice to be able to toss one out and have a fresh way every few weeks. Highly recommend this, I won&#x27;t be trying any others out. :)</li>
            <li> They work, keeping my teeth from grinding together, but they&#x27;re not as comfortable as fitted guards because they tend to move around within my mouth a lot. I wash them off each day and use them longer than the instructions say, not knowing why they should be so dirty so quickly if they&#x27;re cleaned well after each use.</li>
            <li> Only 12 of the 14 mouth protectors were in my package.  Two of the fourteen mouth protectors were empty!!&lt;br /&gt;Package is deceiving.</li>
            <li> I have been using these disposable night guards for years- I use them when I travel and when I need a break from my dentist formed guard (the one I have from the dentist can irritate my top lip on the inside). I have chewed through a number of the guards that you can buy at the drugstore and form to your teeth so I was skeptical about using disposable guards but I haven&#x27;t chewed through any of these guards yet. I have used one more than 3 days out of necessity and it worked fine. I like that you can wear it on your top or bottom teeth and have found it to be very comfortable.</li>
            <li> So far so good, I&#x27;m like them, no more grinding easy to clean and I think they&#x27;ll last longer then 3 days a piece. good quality</li>
            <li> If you have been told by a dentist you need a night guard to prevent damage from grinding your teeth, this is the product for you.  If you feel tension in the neck and jaw from clenching your teeth at night, Plackers will help prevent physical grinding damage to your teeth. Both the professional guard at $500, and the Plackers Mouth Guard adds a buffer between your upper and lower teeth that prevents that physical grinding  damage.  Neither can stop your clenching or the grinding action you make with your mouth, they only protect your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guard takes a couple of nights to get used to and is secure and relatively comfortable.  Just like a Pro unit, you will salivate more than normal, however that will subside.  The package indicates you should use each one for only 3 days, probably to prevent bacterial growth.  I have found that if you clean and dry them each morning they are good for far more than 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/11/14&lt;br /&gt;I visited plackers.com and noticed an offer for a \\&quot;free sample\\&quot;.  After creating an account and providing shipping information, I was very disappointed to find that \\&quot;free\\&quot; meant you had to pay $2.99 for shipping and handling.</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth at night so these have been a life saver. They are very small and for the price you can throw them out once they get worn and get a new set.</li>
            <li> My husband loves these!  We cannot find them at the store anymore so I&#x27;ve been ordering them online. It&#x27;s so much nicer then the big bulky mouth gaurds that arn&#x27;t disposable. Can&#x27;t rate that this high enough!!!!</li>
            <li> Said it would fit upper or lower and I need for lower and it won&#x27;t stay in place. I would like to return, but no paperwork included. So I&#x27;m out $36.00</li>
            <li> These little mouthguards are comfortable enough to wear at night and even during exercise or just when you&#x27;re stressed and tend to clench or grind your teeth.  I grind my teeth a lot, so I always keep one handy in case I feel myself start to clench my jaw a lot.</li>
            <li> Good product! Very good quality</li>
            <li> I use this product every night. They last 4-5 nights and then I&#x27;m ready to throw them away. I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 1 year now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different types, but these work the best. They are small so I don&#x27;t feel like I am going into a boxing match. Give them a shot.</li>
            <li> These seem good, though they are a little rough.  Also the narrow piece that connects the two ends pushes up against the tops of my gums, which is a little uncomfortable.  But everyone&#x27;s mouths are different shapes.  Maybe mine&#x27;s freaky.</li>
            <li> Flimsy product that will not stay in place.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine going to sleep with one of these in my mouth. I would swallow it for sure. Wasted my money.</li>
            <li> The guard works for mild teeth grinding an does not irritate the soft tissues of the mouth the way a full mouth guard can.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it fits my bite perfectly! my month is kind of small so any other is hurtful... and I can use it three nights and then throw it away.! awesome product!</li>
            <li> It was my first time that I used guard , I feel comfortable at all. If you looking for guard, it&#x27;s a good one to try.</li>
            <li> Worth the price. Works real good.</li>
            <li> These are really helpful.  I have a strong gag reflex and they have not made me gag.  I didn&#x27;t even realize I was clenching my teeth until I had a root canal and was experiencing so much pain after from clenching my teeth at night after the procedure.  I ordered these and wore them at night and now my mouth has had a chance to heal and I&#x27;m not feeling any more pain from my root canal.  I agree with other reviews that as long as you clean them each morning, these should last much longer than 3 days each.</li>
            <li> I love it. It&#x27;s soft and the size is perfect for my mouth. I used for over 3 years. This is the 2nd time I ordered. I shared with my friends.</li>
            <li> I wear these 24/7 as I grind and clench my teeth, are for nite use but work great in the day also. I have very strong gag reflexes so can&#x27;t wear most of the heavier thicker guards. Are recommended for 3 day use, but I wear mine until I bite thru which happens in 5-7 days. Some day my stress might lessen and I can quit wearing at least in the day but for now I am on auto delivery as you can no longer find them in the store and the cost is pretty much the same. PS does not interfer with talking or drinking and most people do not know I am wearing the guard, which is great. Must be removed to eat.</li>
            <li> The fit of these mouth guards does take some getting use to, but they have helped a lot and my neck feels better every morning.</li>
            <li> i was looking so long for something who can help to stop grind while sleeping&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it does a great job and protect my teeth .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;first time i used this product , i felt presure on my teeth, and i took it out .&lt;br /&gt;day two was better , day three was perfect</li>
            <li> good guard and affortable</li>
            <li> One size is toooo small. I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> They stop my teeth grinding with just a little flap of rubber.  Much more comfortable than a mouthguard.  I can usually get a weeks worth of wearing out of them.  The little flap get all chewed up after a while.</li>
            <li> I have only used the guards for two nights and I am happy to report NO headaches and No tooth aches.  Prior to using the gaurds I had been grinding to the point that I was sick to my stomach in the morning from the headache and my teeth were tender to brush....I hope this is my answer.  It&#x27;s looking very promiseing.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work very well for me. I tried for many, many nights to use this product, placing it on the bottom, on the top to no avail. There was no way that these would stay in place for me. Although I clench my teeth at night, I don&#x27;t think I ,do it consistently. Once you relax and you mouth opens (a.k.a. You stop clenching your teeth together) the darn thing falls out into your throat or right out of your mouth. I wanted it to work...I&#x27;m on to something else...</li>
            <li> I have TMJ issues and needed a night guard to keep from clenching at night. I used these for two days and my jaw shifted forward and I could no longer chew. My teeth started hitting each other and I was in a lot of pain. I quit using these and the next morning my jaw went back and I was fine.</li>
            <li> Love these. Good for small mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of different night guards. Partial and full mouth &#x27;boil to fit&#x27; small retainer types including the little adjustable comfort fit ones. All ended up messing up my gums or cheeks. Most wound up smelling bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are super soft, clean up with a simple rinse and are usable for a week or more (I&#x27;ve used one for a month running, though they do flatten out a bit over time). I&#x27;ve had no gum problems at all. The only issue is they don&#x27;t put material between all your teeth, just the main group of grinders - not a problem for me as my tooth squeezing is pretty even. My first pack lasted me a year. I&#x27;m buying two more to make sure I have a good supply.</li>
            <li> I have the problem in the past 20 years, and created a lot of  mouth pieces at the dentist, spending a lot.  This is a good buy, no uncomfortableness when I am sleeping.</li>
            <li> These last 2-3 weeks easily and even then only seem to lose some of their springiness rather than wearing through. I am a lifelong grinder and bruxater and tend to wear through anything else I&#x27;ve tried. These work and fit well and are a great deal. Occasionally they end up out of place during sleep but this is rare.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these guards! They fit well and don&#x27;t hinder my sleep.</li>
            <li> These really work well. They are very comfortable, made from a very soft and pliable material and fit my mouth perfectly. You can reuse them over and over again and they are hundreds of dollars cheaper then what the dentist would charge! I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a weird feeling in my mouth but the work great during the day... but cant seem to keep them in my mouth at night... it&#x27;s jus me... i wake up in the morning to see them beside me on the bed... lol... ^_^</li>
            <li> These were the last in a series of night guards I bought this fall after dental work and my habit of clenching left my teeth extremely sensitive. These seem like the best deal to me, as I only use a guard occasionally and they can be used multiple times each. You can reuse the tiny disposable cases a few times as well so they are great for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Issues others have brought up:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thickness of pads -&lt;br /&gt;They aren&#x27;t super thick, but I don&#x27;t grind, so it&#x27;s not an issue for me. I found them to be just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Size -&lt;br /&gt;They aren&#x27;t adjustable and aren&#x27;t quite as long as my SleepTek guard, but after sliding the guard around in my mouth for a bit I found a comfortable position.</li>
            <li> They work as described.  Very reasonable price.  Now if I could just stop the clenching too.</li>
            <li> I like these so much more than the guard my dentist sold me for $175.  These are clean,small and give space between the bite.  I&#x27;ll definitely order more.</li>
            <li> My dentist thought I was grinding my teeth, so I got this for night wear. After 3-4 nights, my jaw felt out of alignment. I don&#x27;t have TMJ but this seemed not good - so I discontinued it &amp; will take my chances on the possible grinding thing. Oops - trying to solve one problem may incur another. These last a while when washed out daily, so I now have 13 left to give away...</li>
            <li> These are amazing!  I alternate wearing them on my upper and lower teeth.  I tried a bulkier mouth guard first but it bothered me and these have been great!  Thank you to the inventor.</li>
            <li> What can I say I grind my teeth badly, and these help.</li>
            <li> Works great!  The instructions say to replace every 3 days, but I use one longer than that.  I have been told by the Dennis I have a smallmouth and they fit fun.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review for my husband.  After reading other reviews, we chose this product for his TMJ.  After a few days of use, almost all of the symptoms were gone.... now a few months later - no more symptoms, especially the horrid TMJ headaches.</li>
            <li> I got these because my dentist made night guard doesn&#x27;t fit anymore because of a new crown. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t fit me well. I tried it out during the day and laid down like I would to sleep. I noticed that my mouth wanted to stay open with this thing in it.  It didn&#x27;t really stay in place and since I move my tongue when I rest or sleep, it dislodges the little pad that rests on the teeth on either side. I have a small mouth and the pads go back almost as far as the molars in front of the wisdom teeth, but doesn&#x27;t totally cover those molars. The idea I guess is that this thing is held in place by being between your gums and inner lip area. For me, it became dislodged too easily and I felt like I could choke on it. The material is nice and squishy, which provides a good cushion instead of the really hard dentist made night protector. Too bad I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Fits great in my small mouth, fits my dentist&#x27;s recommendation of a thin one so not to mess up your bite. I also have an easy gag reflex, this one is the only one of those I tried that did not make me gag. They say disposable after 1 night, but if you rinse it with water and/or mouthwash and store it in a clean place it lasts up to 3 days, or more if you don&#x27;t use every night. When there are teeth marks on mine I usually trade it for a new one.</li>
            <li> much less cumbersome and more comfortable than a regular mouth guard.  Use for a few weeks then replace.  About $1 per mouth guard.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to receiving this because of its high reviews and because it looked like a similar sample product my orthodontist gave me for my tmj.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the mouths guards differ in that the sample was longer and had two plastic bubbles that would keep my top and bottom teeth from touching/grinding. They were also situated towards the back molars where the actual clenching occurs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS product is made of thick plastic, which could work but they sit too forward (think: front molars vs second to last molar) and unnaturally in my mouth. It causes my mouth to rest in a semi wide open position, which over time the mouth guard moves out of place and ends up sitting inside my mouth on my tongue. Um....major CHOKING HAZARD!!! The first night I used it, only minutes after dozing off, miraculously I woke myself up nearly choking on the mouth piece. I don&#x27;t understand how this doesn&#x27;t happen to the majority?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I have a larger mouth.......I dunno but I am sending this product back. Oh if anyone knows where I can find the mouth piece my ortho gave me please send me a comment. I don&#x27;t remember the brand and my doc n I are not longer on speaking terms. It&#x27;s a long story. Something to do with overcharging me... that bastard.</li>
            <li> I own a dental mouth guard. Made from the dentists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer these usually than the dentist one. It fits in nice and it&#x27;s not invasive in my mouth. easy to sleep with it in. However, I&#x27;m really worried about one thing with these. And maybe, I&#x27;ll update and let you know if it has changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But i wear these and I feel my Jaw doesn&#x27;t line up the next day. like it&#x27;s misaligned or something. So my bite feels really off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a little worried. Hopefully I can update and say this is only temporary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Teeth are aligned now. I dont really have a problem except sometimes i spit it out when sleeping.</li>
            <li> I bought these with high hopes of helping me with my clinching issue. Most of the reviews were great, especially for people with a small mouths, except 1 person. Well I should have listened to that one. I have a very small mouth (as my dentist always tells me) yet these did not fit at all. They were actually too small in my opinion, more like child size. They hit right behind my eye teeth and have nothing to hold them in, so I felt the need to hold on to it tightly so it didn&#x27;t fall out of my mouth or even worse I chock on it in my sleep. This made me clinch more. I feel like if they were longer then they possibly would have worked but even then I am not sure. They are very flimsy and have nothing to hold them to your teeth. I&#x27;m just not sure how other people get them to stay in place but I couldn&#x27;t make it work.</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive at first, but I&#x27;ve been using these for a couple months now and they are great.  They are comfortable, and I haven&#x27;t choked on them or died, so that&#x27;s a plus.  Buy &#x27;em.</li>
            <li> These are far too large for my mouth. One size does not fit ALL. These were never remotely comfortable, and I gave them a good chance. When I used it on the bottom teeth it scraped up my gums badly. When I used it on my top teeth it did prevent teeth grinding on eachother but not the tension in my jaw. I woke up with worse tmj headaches than my worst mornings.</li>
            <li> Best guard for the money. Thin enough to not interfere with your bite. Others I have used were too thick and made my jaws ache.</li>
            <li> Works great. Each one lasts about 3-4 days before wearing down, as the box says. They are small and fit comfortably.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased Grind no more several times.  They keep me from destroying my teeth in my sleep.  I use each guard for a couple of weeks.  So I don&#x27;t use one a night.  Great value.</li>
            <li> This is the only mouthguard I can wear because of my overbite. I will NEVER run out of these as they help prevent my headaches that I get from grinding my teeth.</li>
            <li> Best solution to my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not chunky and fits quite well. I tend to choke on other brands, or find myself looking like Chewbacca.</li>
            <li> I find these minimalist mouth guards do not obscure my breathing or feel too bulky if I wake up for a minute and register its presence. Because it&#x27;s slim, I do not experience any significant change in my bite pattern either, which can be a problem with over the counter mouth guards. They absolutely prevent grinding and chomping, and I personally wash them and use them for a couple of weeks (even though the package recommends only 3 days of use per guard).  I&#x27;ll be buying my second box soon.</li>
            <li> This changed my bite.  Initially,the upper teeth were sensitive to the thing.  Then, my jaw and teeth hurt when I put it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not molded so you are biting very hard plastic.  Then the bottom teeth are clashing against the guard as well since it is flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may need a dentist to correct any damage that this guard did to my teeth and jaw.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the product!</li>
            <li> After going thought multiple hard plastic over the counter and dentist made $500.00 night guards I gave these a try about 2 years ago. I LOVE THEM!! They fit well either on my upper or lower teeth and they are not distracting my sleep. There is not taste or odor. I love that they are soft enough to be comfortable but durable enough to withstand my grinding. I wear them for more days than it stated on the instructions with no problem. Every morning I brush it well and give it a quick splash of my mouthwash. I love that they are portable and I keep one in my travel bag so I&#x27;m sure to always have one with me. This is one of my favorite products. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth at night, so if I don&#x27;t wear a dental guard my jaws ache by morning.  I always bought the no-boil dental guards, but they are so hard to keep clean.  My mother-in-law turned me on to Plackers, as recommended by her dentist.  After I tried them out for the first time, I knew I would buy them again.  They are slim and flexible so you can still close your mouth, and they are really unnoticeable once you have them in.  I use mine for 5-7 days then throw it out and use a new one.  To me, this is much more hygienic than using the same mouth guard for months at a time.  They are relatively inexpensive when you compare them to the custom ones dentists try to sell you, or to the ones that say they last 3-6 months but are hard to keep clean.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely not for anyone who has TMJ.  I am a grinder and a clincher.  This product just wasn&#x27;t for me because I could still clinch and grind.  These mouth guards are very thin and flimsy.</li>
            <li> My husband uses these, he really does not like the bigger ones.  He uses for about 10 to 14 days and then discards.  They really do the trick for grinding teeth.  What is nice is you do not have to soak these or keep them in water.  Just pop in mouth every night, and dispose when they start to loose there strenght.  If you do not want the hassle of the more expensive ones these are for you.  After you open them there is no case so he just pops it in a small baggie, add a couple drops of mouthwash to keep it fresh.</li>
            <li> I use these during the day only.  The material is comfortable and soft.  How effective they are I really couldn&#x27;t say.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay in my mouth :( when I wake up it&#x27;s always.. not in my mouth anymore so.. not useful for me</li>
            <li> I have a very small mouth and I read a ton of reviews on here saying this would be perfect.  I don&#x27;t know who would feel comfortable wearing this all night.  It&#x27;s a really loose fitting piece of plastic.  Unless you are constantly biting down on it, it slides out of place easily.  I was so afraid I&#x27;d end up choking on it in the middle of the night.  A custom fitted mouth piece is worth the peace of mind.</li>
            <li> I like to wear them at night. Love them..would order from them again</li>
            <li> low cost option &amp; poor fit; woke up choking :-(</li>
            <li> I love these things!  $1k+ for a night guard from my dentist or these...hmmm.  They are comfortable, Not bulky like professional dentist, I can get a new clean one every couple of days, great for travel... Oh ya, and they work!</li>
            <li> They are the best they work amazing !! :)</li>
            <li> I bought this guard to prevent my teeth grinding. It fits perfectly in my mouth. So glad I tried them. I had used a different mouth guard previously and it was too big even after adjusting it. I would wake up with dry lips, drool, and a sore mouth. With this mouthpiece, I barely know its in and I wake up with my jaw and teeth feeling great.</li>
            <li> It works fine. For the price it is good. I&#x27;m kinda glad its a use and dispose model but i question how long we can use it safely in the mouth without any repercussions. Plus I&#x27;m still not entirely sure what kind of bacteria will accumulate with using it more than 3 nights in a row. I alternate between two and keep the other one in a bowl of listerine.</li>
            <li> These were purchased as an inexpensive alternative to the pricey mouthguard my dentist suggested. I occasionally grind my teeth at night (usually due to stress). I don&#x27;t need to wear a guard every night, but I needed something to get me through rough patches. These do the job. They&#x27;re simple and small, and I&#x27;m usually able to forget I&#x27;m wearing them and fall asleep easily. After a few nights they start to lose their effectiveness (as your teeth begin to flatten out the cushioning). You can use them for several nights in a row, but I recommend rinsing them every morning and before bed to keep them clean and fresh. They&#x27;re not perfect, and they certainly don&#x27;t fit like a custom guard, but for the price they are a very reasonable solution.</li>
            <li> these are wonderful. The package I bought says \\&quot;no BPA\\&quot; which was a big concern for me. I have a small mouth and a low gag reflex and I find these totally fine. Before I started them I&#x27;d just cracked a molar completely in half and had to have it extracted - total agony. The dentist said it wouldn&#x27;t have happened if I&#x27;d been wearing a mouthguard. Now I have to get an implant ($5000!!!!) and can have a mouthguard made after the my surgery and crown in 4-5 months. In the meantime, I found I was grinding so hard, I cracked my front tooth. Total panic. Ran to the drugstore and bought these. They are wonderful! I never thought I&#x27;d be happy to sleep with a hunk of plastic in my mouth, but it&#x27;s a huge comfort to know I&#x27;m not wrecking my teeth, brushing doesn&#x27;t hurt now, and I don&#x27;t have a headache when I wake up. I ordered a Stressgard which just came in the mail but it doesn&#x27;t fit despite trimming and instantly made me gag, so I&#x27;ll continue with the Plackers Grind-no-MOre for the foreseeable and grateful to have found something that&#x27;s comfortable and works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with teeth grinding at night since I was a teen. Needless to say, I&#x27;ve paid a lot of money over the years for custom night guards. These little protectors work pretty much the same way the expensive ones do: keep the teeth separated and thus prevent grinding. By-the-way, you can wash these and use them again- depending on how hard they&#x27;re used! There is only one, little concern I have to pass along. The surface area the teeth grind over is one tooth on the top, and one tooth on the bottom (both sides, of course). This, in rare occasions, may cause sensitivity of those individual teeth because the load is not spread over more teeth (like a normal bite). It&#x27;s not a concern enough not to try these if you really know you&#x27;re grinding at night. For sure, you should also be followed by a dentist. Those guys are extremely familiar with any TMJ disorder.</li>
            <li> This is my first mouth guard and I was a bit leery about sleeping with something in my mouth. The protector has no taste and is not very big. My mouth does feel a little weird after I take it out in the morning; it seems that the alignment of my bite changed at night. However, I&#x27;ll continue to use it since it suits my needs!</li>
            <li> I have chronic pain so I often find myself grinding my teeth. Because of that I not only wear my Plackers at night, I&#x27;ll where this mouth guard during the day while I&#x27;m driving or watching TV, especially Detroit Lion&#x27;s football. I found these on Amazon to be the least expensive, especially if you have automatic delivery.</li>
            <li> These nightime guards are superior to any form fitting teeth guard. These guards are comfortable and I&#x27;m able to use them 4 or 5 nights before disposing.&lt;br /&gt;These guards are extremely comfortable,  enabling me to wear them on the upper or lower teeth. Because of the versatility,  they do not cause sores or tender gums. No need to boil and try to shape them into fitting, no looking and sounding like a linebacker!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is great, much much cheaper than purchasing these at Walgreen! Now stop reading and hit &amp;#34;add to cart&amp;#34;! You will be so pleased, and your dentist will thank you!</li>
            <li> They just fall out in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li> Awesome for my teeth clenching and grinding problem!</li>
            <li> UPDATED 1/9/2017: The flexible fit of these is still great. But I got tired of tasting and swallowing the strong Plastic Chemical taste these have.  Even when I rinse/soak them,nothing takes away the chemical taste. I&#x27;ve since found others with a similarly flexible fit that are BPA free and I feel much better about putting them in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;————-——&lt;br /&gt;These are hard to find in drug/grocery stores so I order them online because they are the best.  I&#x27;ve tried several other mouth guards, and these by far are the most comfortable.  They&#x27;re soft and pliable so they don&#x27;t hurt your gum line or jaw after a full night of grinding.</li>
            <li> If you grind at night, this is your product.</li>
            <li> Maybe just me - but these are small (even with my small bite) and move around way too much in my mouth during the night, resulting in uneven pressure on teeth, odd bite, and soreness in the morning.  Not my solution.</li>
            <li> This product does not work for me - it does not stay in place on top teeth or bottom, I was afraid i&#x27;d swallow it during the night. It well made and a quality product but you need to look at it very carefully because it is also very slim on the material and one size does not fit all</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live without them.</li>
            <li> no bad cheaper than the real deal .. but still feels bulky in my mouth.. it does the job.. but you know its there..</li>
            <li> basically ok, but the size is a little bit small</li>
            <li> Best one I have found in terms of comfort. Does seem to put more pressure in a smaller area though. Don&#x27;t mind though.</li>
            <li> Grind no more are comfortable, allow you to breath and speak easily.  Perfect solution!</li>
            <li> Love these things.  Much cheaper on line than in the store.  They work well.</li>
            <li> Will not stay in mouth while your sleeping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so small and flexible, I would be afraid to fall asleep with this in my mouth. Felt like a choking hazard.</li>
            <li> Convenient for travel or when you are tired to use your dentist customized night protector, just for a change.  Because it is made of soft rubber I have found myself tending to chew it more than what I do with the rigid protector I got from my dentist.  One night I even dreamed I was chewing gum.  Stays pretty good in place, but after the fifth use, it tends to deform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use it more than the three recommended times, which manufacturer says just to make you keep buying more, but it actually can be used more times, if you care to keep it antiseptically stored.</li>
            <li> I make my husband stick one of these in his mouth when he starts snoring at night so I can get some sleep. Works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I get a week or more on each one.  I wash it off each morning and put by my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> guards that only hit on the molars...only make the grinding worse.</li>
            <li> Save your money,  just a bunch of garbage. Tried them on the top &amp; bottom, couldn&#x27;t get them to stay in place.</li>
            <li> I woke up with blisters on the insides of my cheeks, the gummy stuff stuck in my molars, and a headache.  Returned it and happily receiving a refund. It didn&#x27;t arrive on time to begin with, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wound up just going to the dentist and getting a real night guard.</li>
            <li> Because I have a small partial plate, I could not get these to work.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t stay in my mouth, I wish to delete my subscriptions</li>
            <li> My daughter has TMJ and she uses these at night. She likes them and is surprised that they have lasted as long as they have since at first glance they are rather flimsy looking.</li>
            <li> Horrible ! Do not buy. Hard plastic bands in your mouth are not the solution</li>
            <li> I love the minimalist design. It&#x27;s very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Love these! Only guards I do not spit out overnight. Great quality, fast shipping. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Very easy to choke on if you are a mouth breather while sleeping. Forewarning.</li>
            <li> They are thick compared to the older design, but they do the job well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few mouth guards before without problem, but thought I&#x27;d give these a try since they&#x27;re compact and would be good for travel. What a complete waste. I have a small jaw and reading the reviews I had pretty high hopes. The guards fit really poorly due to their extra soft form and moved around so easily that unless my jaw was super clenched it wouldn&#x27;t stay in properly. It&#x27;d wiggle out of place at the slightest tongue movement and didn&#x27;t want to stay in at all. Relaxing my jaw or moving my lip even a little would cause it to flop out of position. I didn&#x27;t feel safe sleeping with them in for fear I&#x27;d be that one in a million that chokes on it when it undoubtedly fell out of place.</li>
            <li> I had a custom night guard from my dentist that cost me $250.  It finally gave out, and I couldn&#x27;t afford to replace it, so I thought I would give these a try.  They actually work!  And I am able to make one last a whole week.  I will order these again.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Some getting used to.</li>
            <li> This worked better for me than the expensive one my dentist fitted me with.  It does not interfere with breathing.</li>
            <li> At my last dental check-in my dentist told me that I appeared to be grinding my teeth at night.  I purchased these as a hopeful alternative to an expensive orthotic grind guard.  I totally wasted money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These didn&#x27;t stay in place and were uncomfortable.  In short, they did crap all to help my night grinding.  In the end, I coughed up the co-pay for the orthotic grind guard.</li>
            <li> Now.  I am not going to tell you not to buy it and all that other junk rambling that goes after , but i can tell you that it did not work for me. Why? Well because at first it felt good and comfortable in my mouth. i was all happy and excited to finally have found a solution to my grinding. Not so fast , right i realized i had to bite down a little harder then normal to keep it in my mouth no problem, i am not a mouth breather when i sleep so no problem there. woke up though the night it was still in my mouth and i was still happy, somewhat. then the morning came I realized my jaw was locked in the position at which  mouth guard was inserted it took me all day exercising my jaw to get it back to it&#x27;s normal alignment. Since i did not tell you to buy it not not to, i &#x27;ll tell you what i did . I stop using it the same night.</li>
            <li> These are great, they are not bulky and control my grinding. Plus they are great for traveling and sanitary. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> As a retired dental hygienist, I can say these are a great alternative to a professional mouth guard if you just don&#x27;t have the funds to get one made through your dentist.  I will say; however, that they do run on the small side, so if you have a wide arch (I don&#x27;t want to say a &amp;#34;big mouth&amp;#34;, but that&#x27;s what it comes down to...LOL!) these will probably be too small.  Overall, a decent little product.</li>
            <li> These actually work! Although it seems impossible that they would actually stay in position in your mouth all night, they do stay, are not uncomfortable, and do the job. The alternative was to shell out $500 to my dentist for a custom mold.</li>
            <li> I tried a few different grind guards and this was the best. It stays in my mouth all night and is very comfortable...plus the price is right.</li>
            <li> These are the easiest to use for teeth grinders. Just take it out of the package and put it in your mouth. No boiling or sizing. I did try the full mouth guard type and just couldn&#x27;t get it to fit properly. I sleep well because you don&#x27;t feel these in your mouth as much as others. These are simple and fool proof and you get the same protection as any guard out there. The price is cheap also.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love them! They are teeth savers and they also helped me with my TMJ problem. Before I used them, my mouth would hurt so much, that at times I would scream until some a killers started to work. Since I discovered Plackers, I have no more pain and my problem is manageable - otherwise I was recommended an expensive surgery with no guaranty of success.. BTW, a pack of 14 lasted me over a year as I reuse them until they feel worn-out.:)</li>
            <li> Only used these for 2 nights, but both me and my partner agree they&#x27;re the best over the counter guards we&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re small but adequate for most people, I would think, unless you have a huge jaw. They are soft, clear plastic, but thick enough you won&#x27;t chew through on one or two nights. We jokingly thought we might swallow them, but they stayed in place and have no fear of that happening.&lt;br /&gt;The price is right, and cheaper than other products that claim to be dental-quality. The plastic is very soft (think day-old gummy bear candy-ish), and they don&#x27;t rub your gums.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll see how things go a month from now, but i suspect each one will last at least 5-6 days and i&#x27;m willing to spend the equivalent of $7 month on these until hopefully the grinding pattern is broken. Bonus, when I wake up my jaw is more relaxed. Good luck.</li>
            <li> Bad bruxism wore down my teeth badly and the grinding was dislodging the teeth resulting in infections and root canals on about 3 teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I find these to be a life saver or should say tooth saver.&lt;br /&gt;Does anyone else use 2 at a time? On the bottom and top teeth of course? Since the guard doesn&#x27;t extend to my back teeth and I had heard tell of folks grinding through the big heavy mouthpieces, I decided to use 2 at a time. This has been great, keeps my back teeth apart, I believe.&lt;br /&gt;I also replace them about 3 or 4 weeks in.</li>
            <li> I wish I had known about these all those years I was having the Dentist make them.  They are light and comfortable and assuredly BPA free.</li>
            <li> I wear the mouth guard every other night, and it is so durable that I can actually reuse it (as long as keeping it clean).</li>
            <li> After a recent trip to the dentist I was told that I grind or clinch my teeth.  The dentist explained that they could make a mold and have a guard made that I could wear at night to protect my teeth from damage.  Only issue was this guard was very expensive.  I decided to wait on the expensive guard and see what I could find.  After search on Amazon, I found these bad boys.  These do not over all your teeth, but do provide a biting/clinching/grinding area made of soft plastic that takes the damage your teeth normally would.  I will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found them again. Very good product</li>
            <li> My wife loves them...Stops grinding and also cuts her snoring in half...She can use one mouthpiece for weeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable enough....IF...they&#x27;d stay in my mouth. I tried the guard on both my upper and lower jaw and by morning I find they&#x27;ve fallen&lt;br /&gt;right out on the bed. I think I&#x27;ll order another type.</li>
            <li> Bought for TMJ pain due to clenching my jaw, since I saw several reviews saying that they could be used for this. Opened one up to use the first night I had them and found that it made my bottom teeth sit weirdly and made my jaw feel misaligned. Then I noticed that the warnings on the side of the box say to not use if you have tooth or jaw pain due to clenching or grinding. Wish I had seen that before opening the box so I could return it.</li>
            <li> first night pit it in only 30 mins, 2nd night 2hrs then halk night, its really help my jaw but not easy to wear it at all</li>
            <li> The insides poke my tongue and the band doesn&#x27;t go far enough into the back of your mouth.</li>
            <li> I use these nightly. My dentist told me I was grinding at night and tried to sell me a $200 product, too expensive! I have tried many other products that you boil and mold but they tend to be very bulky and pricey. When I originally found these at the dollar store I had to try. They were only a $1, how could you go wrong. I was in love the first night. No boil is required, just open and place. You can wear it on the bottom or top teeth, whichever you feel most comfortable. They say disposable after 2 night, but i tend to wear mine about 5-7 night. I rinse daily in very hot water to get the gunk off. No longer available at the dollar store, so I went to Amazon, and glad to find a bigger box of the exact product. No more grinding my teeth down, no headaches or tight jaw when waking up. Love the product and will be a lifetime user.</li>
            <li> They were ok but did not fit my mouth and constantly fell out. I liked that it gave my mouth more space, but this made me worried that I would choke on it in the night. I changed to a mouth guard that I molded to my teeth.</li>
            <li> Tried it a few times it didnt really fit my teeth and was very uncomfortable. wasted my money</li>
            <li> No more morning headaches!  I don&#x27;t grind my teeth, but I clench them.  This product helped me so much!  Each one lasts along time.  I&#x27;m still using my first one and it has been a month.</li>
            <li> Well made, excellent price, fast delivery. I use these for travel as they are low cost and I don&#x27;t have to worry about losing them. Sold as more or less disposable, they are reusable. The Plackers are small, and low profile, but being small do sometimes fall out of place during sleep, usually just on one side or the other. I use the guard to combat the effects of night clenching, which includes broken teeth and headaches in the morning. These do help. For day to day I use the Sleep Right Dental Guard, which is larger, and the bite wings pivot, so it is actually a three-part guard. I don&#x27;t generally have a problem with the Sleep Right falling out, but the Sleep Right is extremely expensive and it is hard to understand why it costs so much. Either is much better than the very expensive custom bite guard from the dentist, which I am convince led to another broken tooth. Plackers work by putting a bit wing between the molars, which prevents excessive pressure. My dentist explained that the bit wing should not have excessive squishyness, as that trains the sleeper to repetitively bite down;  rather the proper bite wing should be soft enough to not damage teeth but hard enough to train the sleeping brain to not bite. The bit wings on the Plackers are thin silicone, which seems to fit the bill. If you wonder whether a bite guard will help you, this is a very reasonable priced item and makes either a low-cost experiment or for permanent use. BTW, I did not know for years that I was biting at night, I don&#x27;t grind, just clench, so my wife never knew. What finally clued my dentist in was receding gums, which he said was due to clenching, and finally breaking some teeth. Literally cracking them to pieces due to the repetitive and extreme pressure. Talk to your dentist if you are waking up with headaches around the back of your head and sore jaw, teeth or gums. This turns out to be a serious and expensive dental issue if you don&#x27;t take preventive measures.</li>
            <li> I have had the professionally made grind guards before and they never stayed in my mouth, they just ended up lost in the sheets. I was a little leery about the size (I was paranoid about choking on them) of these guards because they are so small compared to what I have tried in the past but these are the best ones I have used to date.</li>
            <li> Finally a way to stop damaging my teeth by grinding without some massive mouth guard in my mouth all night! Those moldable mouth guards, sure, you can get them hot them bite em and they are custom fit. BUT - turns out that is totally unnecessary - and thank god because those guards are so massive it was like trying to sleep with a tennis ball in my mouth! These Plackers are totally the way to go - cheap and small! I thought I might accidentally choke on them at first, but they totally stay in place. You can use them more than once, despite what packaging says. they lose their shape the more they are used, but I use each one about five times before tossing it.</li>
            <li> They are cheap but work! My husband grinds his teeth and has been told by the dentist that he will wear his teeth to nubs and the damage will be permanent if he doesn&#x27;t stop now.  They want to make a custom fitting mouth guard but it will cost many hundreds of dollars which we just don&#x27;t have right now and is not covered by insurance. We realize that we will have to keep buying these but it is a good fit for us right now and it does stop him from grinding, protecting his teeth from further damage.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!  Great product!</li>
            <li> Versatile fit and not bulky in the mouth. For heavy teeth grinders, these don&#x27;t last very long. I go through one every 2 weeks or less. Personally, I would look into a more durable product.</li>
            <li> its okay,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they do their job but as soon as you wake up in the middle of the sleep you have a soar mouth and weird feeling teeth...thats if you wake up in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li> These barely fit my 9 year old daughter&#x27;s mouth, much less mine. Way too small!</li>
            <li> I am really grateful for these. I love how small they are and if it gets flung across the room and lost it is ok since there are so many in a pkg. I grind my teeth at night but have a lot of drainage down my throat so other night guards make me gag because they are to big and bulky. This is a good price too.</li>
            <li> This Plackers Mouth Guard Grind has prevented me from grinding my teeth. It is so comfortable to wear and does not hurt my mouth.</li>
            <li> Great product! Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product from a store that had marked it down, lower than the price sold here.  They were needed to replace a dental guard that has now gone up 200% at that dentist.  They are comfortable but I perfer the lower jaw fit. They arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I almost ended up having sinus surgery because of this. Wearing this actually made me clinch more which inflamed my jaw muscles. I thought I had an ear infection, and after a month of antibiotics and a second opinion, we figured out my clenching was causing the issue. After a few days of using another device that is bigger between the top and bottom jaw, everything went back to normal. These guys went directly in the trash afterwards.</li>
            <li> Way too small, not comfortable. Arrived quickly and in good condition. I returned them after trying one.</li>
            <li> These are much more comfortable than the large over the counter ones that are dropped&lt;br /&gt;in boiling water and then you bite down to form them to your mouth.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on any nighttime use, as I&#x27;m using them for daytime use. They&#x27;re effective, thus far, and my only complaint is the brand-name raise-printed on it, which abrades the skin it touches. I can&#x27;t keep them in for a significant amount of time due to this.</li>
            <li> Great product. More value than an expensive dental mould.</li>
            <li> Whenever I drink alcohol I grind my teeth in my sleep. So I have to wear these after a night of drinking. They aren&#x27;t the most comfortable things in the world but they don&#x27;t cut my mouth from being too sharp and it&#x27;s bearable enough for me to be able to sleep. I was experiencing major tooth aches and jaw pain from the grinding, but that completely went away after I started using these guards. So take it as you will. I like this brand. I also use the grinders way more than 3 nights, I just basically use them until they&#x27;re so chewed up that they don&#x27;t give any protection anymore. Dunno how safe or recommended that can be, but I do it anyways :P</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s changing my bite a little, but I can tell it&#x27;s helping!</li>
            <li> I have tried the full mouth ones and could not keep them in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and it will not stay in place in my mouth.  I am afraid it will fall out when I am sleeping and I will choke on it.</li>
            <li> These are great night guards for those of us that grind our teeth, but can&#x27;t stand a full size mouth guard. Even though they are advertised as disposable, I&#x27;ve been able to use a single guard for a few weeks (just disinfect it the same way you would a full size guard). I&#x27;m not a heavy grinder, so I&#x27;m sure that aids in the extend use. I&#x27;ve tried other night guards and these are by far the most comfortable and easiest to keep in all night. Based upon my reported comfort level and reduction in damage to my molars, my dentist asked me what brand I was using to recommend to other patients. I&#x27;m happy to report that they have liked them as well.</li>
            <li> These are the best I&#x27;ve found for my use.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many mouth guards, I lost track.  This one is very comfortable and not too big for my mouth.</li>
            <li> I clench my teeth at night, and bought these hoping it would stop me from waking up with headaches and pressure. No such luck, because they are not long enough to cover your back teeth. I don&#x27;t grind my teeth in the front, which is the only area these cover. And even with that, the design of these don&#x27;t make for them to fit conveniently. I wouldn&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for a while, I prefer them to fitted mouthguards actually. The problem though is that with one in I tend to breathe through my mouth, which dries my mouth out and i guess that can be bad for teeth too.&lt;br /&gt;They seem quite durable and I grind alot, yet can use a single one with washing for months.</li>
            <li> the Good thing about these is that you can wear them during the day (say while driving) and speak  clearly and even sip coffee the bad thing is all they do is provide a cushion so you don&#x27;t grind as hard on the surface of your teeth. The TMJ muscles are still being clenched. My solution  and it has absolutely cured my TMJ is a front teeth appliance from chairsidesplint.com. I wear it at night with no problems and the back teeth can&#x27;t come together.</li>
            <li> Been a longtime grinder...had previously used fitted mouth guards (boil in water to form fit), but they always felt too big and cumbersome.  I was skeptical about these since they&#x27;re one size fits all...figured they&#x27;d fall out easily or be uncomfortable, but they&#x27;re great.  I wear them on my lower set of teeth - very comfortable and unobtrusive, very easy to sleep in.  I can use one for a couple of weeks easily, I just rinse them off in the morning.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> These did help with my boyfriends and my teeth grinding, however the material cuts my gums sometimes. It doesnt his so it is probably just how my teeth are... but I probably cant be the only one.</li>
            <li> I have used mouth guards for years but recently lost two to my favorite dog.  It seems that if I sleep restlessly I yank the thing out and find it next morning chewed to bits.  Very expensive proposition.  These are comfortable and do the job adequately and if the dog gets it, it&#x27;s easily replaced with another without hurting your pocketbook.  This is my third order for these and I love them.</li>
            <li> A horrible dentist left me with &amp;#34; Left-sided temporal mandibular joint osteoarthritic change with meniscal degeneration and incomplete&lt;br /&gt;anterior translation of the mandibular condyle. &amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product at night and take Buddha&#x27;s Herbs Optimum Glucosamine / Chondroitin / MSM Complex.  I also use Young Living oil Valor, rubbed on the jaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just a couple days, I feel almost completely normal again.  I know it says, not for TMJ, but it&#x27;s helping mine.  I don&#x27;t want to pay $500 for the whole mouth guard.  I just want this small pad covering my back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONLY warning - I&#x27;m getting canker sores on the tip of my tongue.  Could be related, very common with anything orthodontia.</li>
            <li> A couple of years ago I wrote a One Star review of this product, but I was being overly harsh, and I want to correct that now: These don&#x27;t inspire much confidence to look at out-of-the-box, however, remarkably they do work. I have a bad nighttime grinding problem and I generally use the The Doctor&#x27;s Advanced Comfort Night Guard teeth grinding product sold on Amazon, but I do use these Plackers Mouth Guards for emergencies--usually, when I am traveling and forget to bring my usual night guard along. I have some missing molars on both the top and bottom of my mouth and these Plackers still work--just as advertised--it&#x27;s hard to believe, just to look at them.</li>
            <li> Great product and I did not think these very slim mouth guards would work, but they did!</li>
            <li> Best deal. Each one last about a week. Better than a $500 custom guard from the dentist.</li>
            <li> The are a bit big for my mouth but they work.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really fit my mouth</li>
            <li> Every night.&lt;br /&gt;Simple and cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Wash by sinking into mouthwash and water mix.&lt;br /&gt;I can compare only with an offer by my dentist to build a personal guide. It is an &amp;#34;overkill&amp;#34; and very expensive.</li>
            <li> Ok....was about to spend $600 for a night guard from my dentist to keep from grinding, and it killed me to spend that much.  Tried these and I still can&#x27;t believe it!  Inexpensive, VERY comfortable, actually works, AND they last way longer than the 3 days recommended on the box!  I might investigate other products along the way, but delighted to know this one works for me with great comfort and effectiveness!  Can easily wear them on the upper or lower teeth (kind of prefer the lower myself), and after one night of feeling a little weird with something in my mouth at bedtime, I had no problems.  Soak &#x27;em in mouthwash during the day to disinfect and freshen them for the next night.  Still kind of surprised, but these work great!!!</li>
            <li> These cut the back of my mouth. they made my gums swell and bleed within three nights of using this product. I went to the dentist once the swelling started, because I thought something was really wrong!! It was just an effect from this product.</li>
            <li> What lawyer doesn&#x27;t spend his/her nights clenching their jaw and grinding their teeth into a fine powder?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first glance, these look like you would choke on them and die.  Alas, that is not a problem.  They take up minimal space in your mouth so you won&#x27;t spit them out in your sleep as your tongue attempts to fight them off.  Your cheeks help them stay in place.  They&#x27;re also just soft enough to be comfortable yet remain effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a ton of more expensive, less effective solutions out there.  I&#x27;ve tried most of them and they&#x27;re uncomfortable, even the professionally fitted ones from the dentist.  This is a fantastic product and they&#x27;re very affordable.</li>
            <li> I bought these after I went to the dentist and recommended a mouth guard.  I clench my jaw a lot in my sleep and wake up feeling very tense in my face.  I first put on my lower teeth and it seemed a little large.  It hit the wrong part of my mouth because I kept gagging. I then put it on the upper teeth and it felt okay.  I slept using one and awoke in the morning with it still in place.  My mouth felt even more tense than usual and general uncomfortable feeling in my mouth.  I took it out and I had two large sores where the sides of the guard broke in the sides of my mouth. Gross.  If you have a smaller mouth I would try something different.  Every users experience is different so don&#x27;t let this review ruin all the good reviews this product has received.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my mouth and fell out during sleep. Felt unnatural and biting down on it only hit some of my teeth which made my jaw hurt when I woke up.&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this product. Sorry no</li>
            <li> Convenient and much cheaper than ones from the dentist. Easily accommodates changes in your mouth.  Is not a corrective device though.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit, didn&#x27;t work and was uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> The good thing about these is that one is able to close ones mouth whereas other mouth guards are bulk and hard to keep mouth closed.  The bad thing is that it can mess with your jaw.  But definitely prevents teeth grinding!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how I would feel about this, but they work so well!  I had a mouth guard made which cost $$$$ but with new crowns etc it doesn&#x27;t fit and I didn&#x27;t want to shell out another huge amount, so I thought I would give these a try.  I have now set up regular delivery with these - they work perfectly! My TMJ is so much less and I am not grinding!</li>
            <li> Great product, I use this every night. They say that the product lasts 3 nights, but I have used one for a week before.</li>
            <li> It works fine but does fall out at night.</li>
            <li> It took a little while to get used to, but they work great for me. I&#x27;m using these as a temporary fix until I can get fitted for a specific one with my dentist. I can feel how they could alter your bite if you used them long term, but for me these are a great solution.</li>
            <li> These work great and you can barely notice you are using them while sleeping. I wear them to work sometimes to. A little hard to talk with them in but they really help with tooth grinding.</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t been able to find these reasonably priced mouth guards.  Just took another crack at it and here they are on Amazon.  They really help my wife sleep beter and wake up without jaw pain.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use it because I lack back teeth needed to use these.</li>
            <li> After buying large, bulky mouth guards for a few years, these are a welcome change!  I can hardly feel it in my mouth, and can even talk clearly with it in.  My first mouth guard is going on 2 months with no signs of wear or discoloration.  This 14 pack will last me for years!  A wonderful product, I will definitely reorder when my 14 pack runs out.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price..</li>
            <li> They felt a little funny at first, but after one night of wearing them, I got used to it. It really does help with grinding, though each one isn&#x27;t good for very long. I&#x27;ll probably move to a more permanent solution eventually.</li>
            <li> The product is so small it will not stay put in your mouth.  This product only has a thin plastic piece that goes around your upper or lower gums and hooks to two flat pieces that go between one or two of your back teeth. I was worried I would swallow it during the night. You would be better off getting a real mouth guard.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing against the seller...just the product.</li>
            <li> These disposable mouth guards work very well and stay in place without being obtrusive</li>
            <li> Novice grinder here. I have low TMJD pain, and I was chomping in my sleep. These mouth guards were the perfect solution for me. There was no need to go to the dentist/orthodontist to get fitted for a huge mouth guard. (My Dad got one specially made, and he can&#x27;t close his mouth all the way when he wears it. How does he even fall asleep?) These are unobtrusive enough to wear over retainers. I know they&#x27;re working, because after a while I&#x27;ll notice I&#x27;ve made bite marks in the material. My TMJD pain has subsided.</li>
            <li> It is bit smaller than expected.  In the mouth, it didn&#x27;t fit quite well and it was floating around and it take some getting used to.  In the morning I found it on the floor, meaning I must have spitted out.  I will try a bit but, I definitely go back to molded guard.</li>
            <li> Got these for hubby, who the dentist had recommended a grind guard.  He had been using the one the dentist custom made him for about $90.  When that broke, I bought these.  He like them even better than his professional one.  I started using them, too.  Really easy to wear, and a fantastic value.</li>
            <li> Although these bite guards are advertised as being disposable, I have used the same one for over a month.  I first bought these while out of town (having forgotten my usual guard) as temporary solution.  This guard has become my preferred one.  What&#x27;s great about them is that you can pack one (or two) for a trip, and still have some at home.  They are comfortable and don&#x27;t affect your speech.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my dear husband, so I can&#x27;t speak for him (although when I asked, he said they fit okay), but I am super happy with them because they stop him from grinding his teeth! Yay!</li>
            <li> I was having headaches and jaw pain due to teeth grinding at night. I was unsure if these would work, but after one night of using this I felt much better! Very happy with my purchase! They are small and it&#x27;s nice that they are disposable, so when they get icky, I just throw them out.</li>
            <li> They are way too soft and actually lead to a lot of jaw soreness</li>
            <li> great alternative to having one made ($$$), these are very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I was unaware that I was grinding my teeth until my fiance pointed it out to me, then after that my back molars were started to chip. Dentist it was due to grinding and clinching. Easy to wear no discomfort ( I&#x27;ve had braces so this is a breeze ;) I can feel the difference in my jaw. I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I am a &amp;#34;grinder&amp;#34;; more specifically I have a front top and front bottom tooth that &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; on each other now thanks to years of TMJ and a crappy dental procedure 20 yrs ago.  I use the Grind No More to keep my teeth slightly apart so these two don&#x27;t meet up and &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; at night (which is a scary-sounding thing in the middle of the night...you think you&#x27;ve just broken a tooth!).  These mouth guards are great because I don&#x27;t actually grind the back down so badly and can be worn for longer than the 3-day recommendation.  I just soak in a small bowl of mouthwash in the mornings.  This is a GREAT find for me!  They&#x27;re comfortable, inexpensive, very unobtrusive and lightweight.  I&#x27;ve had the full-mouth guards before and these work just as well if not better for me.  Can&#x27;t find these in any of my local stores.</li>
            <li> This is helpful for my teeth. Thanks for good product. I like it to save my teeth.</li>
            <li> Having used full mouth guards for my teeth grinding for years, these seemed like a novel solution and less of a mouthful, as it were.  However after using them for over a month (and of course using each one for only the recommended three days) I have two observations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The guard moves around in your mouth as you sleep.  I would often wake up with the thing not providing any protection at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  I recently suffered a nasty bout of molar pain on one side, and I partially attribute this to the small surface area of this product that is used to prevent grinding (and perhaps also to its not staying in place in the mouth).  By having such a small area of product to absorb and distribute the sometimes very strong forces of nighttime tooth grinding, it seems that the teeth above and below where you bite down on the product take the brunt of that pressure.  I believe this caused some motion of the teeth themselves that resulted in considerable pain on one molar and that side of my face.  I could be wrong as I&#x27;m not a dentist, but I&#x27;m going back to using the Doctor&#x27;s Night Guard as that has worked very well for me in the past.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them. They fall out and are a ways of money</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth at night, and my boyfriend suffers.. But before, I don&#x27;t take it seriously until that one time I went to the bathroom at midnight and saw he was sleeping on the coach.. I feel REALLY guilty about it. And i found this, after used it he said i&#x27;m getting MUCH better. Thank you~ However, after take the mouth piece off, you can still feel it.. Anyway, like it!</li>
            <li> I went to my dentist last October for a new bite guard, and it cost $550. Within two months, I had lost the bite guard (or perhaps the dog found it), and tried these until I can face paying the dentist again. They work fine, and are relatively comfortable.</li>
            <li> It works, but,.....not a natural fit on the front teeth and gums....</li>
            <li> I am a prolific grinder.  Without a bruxism plate I would have Flinsstone teeth I&#x27;m sure of it.  I&#x27;ve had top soft plastic pieces.  Small, hard, snap on pieces.  I grind through it all.  So I really kind of bought this as an impulse buy.  To be totally honest, I had put it in my cart, lost interest and went on Facebook.  Then, when I blew about a $100 on South Park DVD&#x27;s (well worth every penny) these magically showed up in the box.  Here I had never taken them out of my cart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Serendipity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t look like much, but you feel like you are treating yourself when you see all the neatly stacked little packages.  It&#x27;s just...so soft.  Flimsy even.  No rhyme or reason as to why they would choose to stay put on EITHER the top or bottom.  Kind of magical actually.  And with no small amount of trepidation, I tired them one night.  Now I have 4 veneers in the front and there is NOTHING on these suckers to protect your front teeth.  I woke up in the morning with the little, tiny guard still in place, teeth that didn&#x27;t feel like cotton on them from having a mouth guard encasing them in so much plastic wrap, and you could clearly see my teeth marks on the plastic.  Perfect placement.  This morning I got up to my cell phone ringing and actually started talking before I remembered I had one in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can I give 6 stars?  When I think of how skanky bruxism plates get.  The scrubbing, soaking in denture solutions and all around nastiness that I no longer have to deal with.  And lets talk about the cost factor.  I can never throw away my old plates.  Even the ones with the holes ground in them.  At $300 a pop, I can&#x27;t afford to lose one while camping.  I&#x27;m going camping next weekend and threw one in with my toothbrush.  I&#x27;ve thrown one in my glove compartment.  (drove 21 hours straight from Fort Myers to Milwaukee an could have used one of these babies around Atlanta.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These have become a staple for me.  Like napkins or extra Walmart bags in the drawer for the cat poop, it&#x27;s simply a must have.bags in the drawer for the cat poop, it&#x27;s simply a must have.</li>
            <li> I started using Plackers Mouth Guard Grind No More Dental Night Protectors over a year ago because the custom dental made mouth pieces are expensive and most of the other OTC ones are too bulky for my mouth. They fit more comfortably and I can usually use one for 3 days. They are soft, so I still grind which doesn&#x27;t alleviate jaw and head aches but it is a much more affordable option for teeth grinding.</li>
            <li> My dentist supplied bite guard was so uncomfortable I couldn&#x27;t sleep without taking it out. These took me two nights to get used to. The design is very simple but also effective. Bottom line: this works for me.</li>
            <li> Best and most comfortable grind guards I can find. I&#x27;ve tried more expensive ones and different types and decided on these as the best. They are still somewhat uncomfortable and my mouth is dried out in the morning--so have a glass of water ready. I usually use each guard for about 4 days until they start to feel odd.</li>
            <li> These do help stop my clenching but they pop off of my teeth a bit. I wish the padded part was larger. Otherwise okay.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. I&#x27;ve paid big money for custom mouth guards and none of them proved to be better than these. They&#x27;re comfortable and disposable. For me, they work just right. They&#x27;re getting impossible to find in the stores for some reason. Thank you Amazon for carrying them.</li>
            <li> First of all, a mouth guard isn&#x27;t going to get you to stop grinding. To stop grinding your going to have to put time and money finding the root of your problem. These little guards, however, do an alright job at protecting your teeth while you chomp and grind away at night. My grinding problem doesn&#x27;t destroy these in 3 days so i tend to wear each one for a couple weeks. I&#x27;ve tried at least a dozen different brands, and all seem to be too big and bulky to be able to sleep well with. I tend to be a mouth breather at night with a very small jaw/mouth. These little things allow me to sleep with very little getting use to it.</li>
            <li> The only dental guard that fits in my mouth. It is not bulky like most of the night dental guards.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the guards are too large and will not stay put.  I&#x27;ve been told by dental hygienists that I have small teeth -- I suspect that this product may work for folks who have more &amp;#34;average&amp;#34; mouths/teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been grinding my teeth since what seems like forever, and these little mouth guards have been my savior! I can&#x27;t wear the bigger mouth guards at night because I never fall asleep - they don&#x27;t feel natural. I like that they&#x27;re versatile and move around in my mouth with my outrageous grinding. I love waking up without headaches and they&#x27;re pretty inexpensive for walking up refreshed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re definitely not for everyone, but I&#x27;d suggest trying them out at least once if you&#x27;re often grinding your teeth at night.</li>
            <li> these made me grind more, not less.  in my experience the hard plastic ones from the dentist work a lot better (although they&#x27;re obviously a lot more expensive) for getting you to grind less-the chewy soft disposable ones just make you more likely to chew on them.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and i really really love it -- it is so easy to use in an effort to protect your teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every other night guard there is and the result is the same, they all get destroyed.  At least Plackers acknowledges it and give you a box full at a reasonable price so you can discard one and start new.  However, they recommend you use these only once and then discard, which is kind of overkill.  I can usually go a week or two before I need to throw one out so one box can last a few months.  I just brush these when I brush my teeth in the morning and let it dry all day and at night it&#x27;s fine.  These are better in one regard to some night guards as they only have pieces that contact your back teeth where most of the grinding action takes place. At least it can reduce some of the shifting of your teeth, yes using night guards shift your teeth.  Over the years I used so many of the moldable night guards that cover your front teeth that it pushed my front teeth out so that they the top teeth don&#x27;t touch my bottom teeth when I clench my teeth together.  Even when using these Plackers every once in a while I&#x27;ll sleep a few days without them so my teeth can get a chance to shift back into place.  I may wake up with neck and upper back cramps but it&#x27;s better than having messed up teeth over the long run.</li>
            <li> This product is much better than expected! I&#x27;m glad I found a substitute for my husband, so he won&#x27;t grind his teeth anymore at night.</li>
            <li> These work great and my daughter has been using them for over a year. We get about a weeks worth out of one guard and the best part is they fit our young daughter (she started wearing them at 5). WONDERFUL!</li>
            <li> particularly for travel.  use them and throw them away.  when i travel i throw a couple of these in my makeup case and never have to worry about losing the more expensive custom made dental night protector.  since i do travel a often, this is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I have used the more expensive ones which you heat up and mold to your teeth.  Those work very well for a month or 2 and cost a LOT more. They will not push your teeth like these do, however.  I can imagine that these will work well for some who&#x27;s teeth align well with the shape of the product.  But, for me after each night of use, my teeth don&#x27;t bite together as they normally should and thus will grind on edges after these are taken out for hours the next day.  They prevent grinding OK overnight, but breakdown a lot faster than the more expensive ones.  The Plackers are very soft, but I don&#x27;t think I might buy again since they adjust my teeth while I use them.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, makes my teeth feel a little weird in the morning, but goes away quickly. Not bulky at all, you can put it on the top or bottom teeth, I prefer the top.</li>
            <li> I used to grind during sleep but now I clench. I used to have guards many years ago but always bit through them.&lt;br /&gt;After using these they aggravated my jaw so incredibly I had a huge headache for almost 2 days straight.&lt;br /&gt;Please be very careful if you have a history of clenching and grinding using these.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t use them after the first night and returned them right away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the boiled mouthguard in the past, and it bothered me when I tried to sleep. I was hoping these would irritate me less, but unfortunately the front lip retaining &amp;#34;strap&amp;#34; tends to both my gums. It feels dry and sticky after a few minutes and it always keeps me up at night. I also found myself rearranging it in the middle of the night. Other than that, it seems to work better than the larger guards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 4/5 stars, the front retaining strap should be slightly longer as it is too &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; and bothers my gums when I try to sleep.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand the hard guards my dentist keeps telling me I &amp;#34;must&amp;#34; use. Since these are MUCH MUCH more comfortable I actually use them. After a few days of using one I usually flip it over and can use it another few days. I&#x27;d say for a very heavy clincher like myself could get about 5-6 days out of one. The clinching comes and goes for me mostly depending on my stress level so I&#x27;d say the 34pk would last me all year. I&#x27;ve already lost 3 custom hard guards over the last 10 years at $250/ea so I&#x27;d say these are not only more comfortable they are much cheaper. They don&#x27;t give the same protection level, but some is better than none and if you (or your kids)lose yours it&#x27;s no big deal. I do worry about choking on it sometimes but I haven&#x27;t had an issue yet.</li>
            <li> I prefer these mouth guards overs all the rest. They&#x27;re very comfortable and easy to get used to.</li>
            <li> These things mess up my bite every night.  These only make contact with a few teeth, so if you actually bite down on them overnight, you&#x27;ll wake up with your bite changed.  It&#x27;s 3pm now (I woke at 7:30am today) and my bite is still way off.  Not only do they change the way your teeth fit together, it&#x27;s a terrible and awkward fit.  Very disappointing and I can&#x27;t wait to get another bite guard.</li>
            <li> One of the warnings declares: Do not use if you are experiencing pain associated with tooth clenching or grinding.  What&#x27;s the point of these if they are not to relieve pain for teeth clenching and grinding?</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe they don&#x27;t advertise this product more!  Have tried more expensive mouth guards and could never find any that were as comfortable as these.</li>
            <li> Cheap enough to throw out after  week&#x27;s use.  Thin, and that works for me. I soak mine in mouth wash and reuse them.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that they will realty help me, but I bought they because of many good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I did right chioce. For me one protector is enought for one week, so I think one pack I will sue almost hall an year.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you to everyone Who lieve reviews on Amazon!!!!</li>
            <li> These mouth guards do okay, but the Dental Guard I previously bought was better. These are really small and somewhat uncomfortable. Next time I&#x27;m going back to the 1st one. Would I recommend these? Maybe for a child or someone with a really small mouth.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit right.  I would not buy again</li>
            <li> I really like these mouth guards just pop in and no boiling for fit so easy  and just brush appliance the when done throw awAy and open new one thank you</li>
            <li> I had an expensive dentist&#x27;s bite guard, which I lost. Instead of going back to the dentist for another expensive thing that is easily lost, I went this route. I actually like these bite guards better. After a week or so they get too thin to continue using and I swap em out.</li>
            <li> Love them but I don&#x27;t understand why I have to throw them away after 3days</li>
            <li> Since these gizmos only support two teeth on each end,  they cause a lot of pain.</li>
            <li> Great guards for daily use, I wear these all day to prevent me from chattering my teeth. I swear by them. I would like it the bite part was a bit thicker as I do wear them down quite quickly. Great product and only one I find I can talk and have a conversation with while in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Works great. I grind my teeth really hard and this holds up for a few days before I toss them. Good alternative to the more expensive options.</li>
            <li> These are simple, comfortable, and disposable.  If you lose one you haven&#x27;t lost a few hundred dollars.  I don&#x27;t know if they work as well as the professionally made ones--I have one and it&#x27;s made of a very tough plastic.  But I prefer wearing these.</li>
            <li> Works for me, although I do tend to take it out in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li> They are small enough for my small mouth. You can use them on top or bottom. I find it best to switch up from top to bottom from  time to time because it seems that I figure out ways in my sleep to clench or grind when I get used to it.  I have literally spent thousands on night guards from dentists over 20 years. Even those were uncomfortable. Grind no more is the best ones I have ever found. Also, I get to throw them away after a few uses and being the germophobe that I am, I no longer have little images in my head of growing bacteria in little carrying cases that the old ones were once kept in. They might seem a little costly but I look at it like a prescription that I must have. My sleep is very important.</li>
            <li> If you have any teeth missing at all, this would not be a good one for you.  You have to get used to them as the insert says which is ok.  Since I have teeth missing on the top, I used it on the bottom as there is only one missing.  One side rubbed against the gum line, but I am trying to work with that.  Otherwise, it should be ok for most!</li>
            <li> Love these!!!  I can get several weeks out of one (cleaning daily of course!)  they are very small and I don&#x27;t even feel like I&#x27;m wearing anything. Ive been using for years with no problems</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Dentek bite guards, but $30 for TWO guards is way too expensive. So I decided to give these a try and I&#x27;m glad I did. They last as long as the Dentek guards, are easier to clean (one rubber piece, not an assembled piece with crevices), and I don&#x27;t grind the rubber off like I do with the Dentek guards. They say these are 3-day guards, but honestly, I use them for longer than that. The price is awesome. I&#x27;m sold on these.</li>
            <li> In my mouth, these work great. This device is comfortable and seems to have solved my clenching problem. I wear them with my plastic (not wire) retainers, which is not possible with other devices. This is not advised, but I have not had any problems.</li>
            <li> For nightly teeth protection from grinding without worry of germ build-up or constant mouth guard cleaning...this is the only product to use!</li>
            <li> These are probably great if all you do is grind but if you clench you may want more cushion as I still wake up with a sore jaw. Also sometimes the little piece doesn&#x27;t stay on the molars so I have still chipped a tooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good for travel if you&#x27;re worried about losing an expensive one. Seem to fit better if you put it on the bottom teeth.</li>
            <li> After reading so many positive reviews on here about these night protectors, I was pretty excited to try them out.  I was surprised that they looked so little, and they don&#x27;t go all the way to your back teeth -- they&#x27;re more like a plastic pad over your front molars.  Unfortunately, after the first night, my jaw actually felt a bit sore, and my bite seemed all off.  I might have TMJ (which they said isn&#x27;t a good mix with these), so that might be the cause, but I&#x27;m not totally sure.  I guess I&#x27;d recommend these if you are POSITIVE you don&#x27;t have TMJ, but if you&#x27;re unsure, I&#x27;d steer clear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand for awhile - work well for me - great price and value - saved lots of $</li>
            <li> I had been searching for an alternative to the big,bulky night guards when I found these. They are so small and low key, it&#x27;s easy to forget you&#x27;re even wearing one! Also, the packaging says they only last a couple nights, but unless everyone else is a stronger/more severe grinder/clencher than I am, they last for up to weeks! Just make sure to wash them the same as you would a regular night guard or a retainer.</li>
            <li> Had to return because nowhere in the product description did it warn that this item was incompatible with bridgework, etc.  I normally am happy with all items purchased through Amazon but this was a real disappointment and headed back for credit.</li>
            <li> These are awesome.  I have always suffered from bruxism but the nightguards are too large.  I pop one of these in and I don&#x27;t feel it.  That&#x27;s awesome to me.  If you suffer from bruxism  try these they are minimally invasive.  My teeth and mouth feel MUCH better.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. MY BOYFRIEND HAS BEEN ABLE TO SLEEP BETTER WITHOUT THE EFFECT OF THE GRINDING. Great product. definitely recommend</li>
            <li> These are great for my husband, who is a LOUD grinder. He tried a couple of the expensive single, longer-lasting, mouthguards, but sometimes he loses them in his sleep. We have 3 dogs, who love to find them, so he goes through them pretty quickly. These are an economical way to keep a &#x27;fresh&#x27; mouthguard on hand all the time. Hubby says they are as comfortable to him as the others...what else could you want?</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t used to chew my fingernails started to, but only when I&#x27;m sleeping.  I will chew them to the point of bleeding, so needed to figure out something to do about it and fast. I tried a couple different ones that you put in water to form to your mouth. They worked okay but I need something different they always felt like I was choking or that I would choose them so bad they wouldn&#x27;t last long. I decided to try these because you didn&#x27;t have to form them and they were disposable. They have worked really great for me and have helped a lot. Sometimes they will last only one night and other times they will last several. Being that they&#x27;re pretty cheap and disposable I&#x27;m not out a lot by chewing it up in one night. I haven&#x27;t really found anything I do not like about them. I got the small package the first time just to try them out, so I would recommend that for a first time trial.</li>
            <li> This is the first night guard I&#x27;ve used that worked for me.  I&#x27;ve had dentists make dozens of upper/lower big, small, etc.  When I used them I had a hard time falling asleep and woke up a lot thinking I was choking on something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that surprised me about this was the size and how its made.  Its basically two small pads with a nylon (or whatever) cord between them.  The pads sit on the third tooth from the back and the cord runs between them around the front teeth up on the gum line.  You can wear them on top or the bottom but they felt better to me on the top.  Basically your tongue never touches them and they&#x27;re far enough forward to avoid feeling like you&#x27;re swallowing a piece of plastic.  It spreads your upper and lower jaw by a minute amount, effectively preventing contact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I &#x27;lost&#x27; it once out of 3 months.  Never had a problem of almost swallowing it or inhaling it, although its possible it might come loose it&#x27;d more likely fall out if it became that dislodged.  It is however possible to push the pads out from between your teeth into your cheek on one or both sides and then you might grind after that.  But that&#x27;s not particularly comfortable so if it does happen you most likely will wake up and put it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bite problems?  My dad is a retired dentist and I checked it out with my regular dentist.  It takes a lot of time and a lot of influence to change a bite.  A little plastic for 6-8 hours a night would take years to move it a little and its more likely that what change you did make at night would revert during the day.  Should you actually get a bite change, your dentist can make a little appliance you&#x27;d have to wear for an hour or two in the morning to correct it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found I can get 3-4 nights out of each one before I&#x27;ve done a lot of damage to it.  I rinse it and put a little mouthwash on it before re-use.  If you&#x27;re a light grinder or clencher you might get more out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!  Wish I&#x27;d have found these 10 years ago and saved myself a few cracked/worn teeth.  I always assumed that whatever the dentist made would be the best option.

            <li> I previously wore dentist made hard plastic molded night guard, which no longer fit on my teeth.  Tried a couple others purchased through drug store, the type you soaked in warm water and molded to your upper teeth.  Weren&#x27;t comfortable.  These Plackers protected exactly where I clench and grind, with minimal invasion to my mouth.  Within a couple nights wear, the affected fractured tooth calmed down, and am very pleased with this little soft appliance. Am very glad I read others reviews and ultimately purchased these for myself.</li>
            <li> Before looking for some disposable night guards for travel, I&#x27;d had two or three for regular use including [[ASIN:B0036WTV2C The Doctor&#x27;s NightGuard Advanced Comfort Dental Protector for Teeth Grinding, 1 pack]]. After using Plackers Mouth Guard for several months, I have to say it&#x27;s the best in the market as far as I know! It does a great job of protecting teeth and is easy to clean. Although it&#x27;s \\&quot;disposable\\&quot;, the plastic is not thin so I&#x27;ve been using the same one every night. Best money spent on a night guard.</li>
            <li> Love love love these mouth guards.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m getting the best sleep I&#x27;ve had in awhile. I dream every single night now. I think I might have also had a case of sleep apnea along with grinding my teeth and now both seem to vanish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:the little plackers branding on the mouthguard seems to be in an awful place and I can feel it on the inside of my lip.&lt;br /&gt;Still love this product. So happy I ordered them.</li>
            <li> I clench my teeth in my sleep, causing migraines. I also have a small mouth, so those &amp;#34;boil to fit perfectly&amp;#34; kind don&#x27;t work... I end up looking like a football player or a wrestler while trying to go to sleep. These are perfect because they fit just right and they have a three day use. After three days, you throw it out and switch to a new one, which you would want to anyway because they do start to flatten out around day three anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I ordered this, it came no problem, The second time, the status said &amp;#34;delivered&amp;#34; but there was no package, though I suspect certain neighbors found they had mouth guards with no idea what to do with them. Amazon was great about sending out a replacement order and THAT one showed up on time.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Fits perfect in my mouth. No more headaches and more important, no more dizzy spells!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Plackers Mouth Guards for about 2 weeks now.  They do fit rather nicely.  I still wake up many times during the night and catch myself trying to grind.  I have already broke 2 teeth because of grinding and will admit it does keep my teeth from actually touching others.  I will continue for at least 2 months to see if there is a change in my sleeping habits.</li>
            <li> Overall, I like these night guards. They slip right between your back teeth and are unobtrusive. You can wear them above your top (I prefer) or bottom teeth as is more comfortable. I have not noticed them slipping off. My only complaint is that I worry my bite is shifting. In addition, I worry that I am clenching my teeth to keep the guard in place. I will likely try another brand due to these concerns.</li>
            <li> Sorry but these are way too flimsy to help me. Some of them are not even &amp;#34;squared&amp;#34; to fit in your mouth… unless my jaw has become &amp;#34;un-squared&amp;#34; which I guess is a possibility.  These are not going to work for anyone as far as I can tell.. They seem to be based on a small set of perfect teeth and a very weak bite… in which case, you wouldn&#x27;t need a mouth guard for in the first place.</li>
            <li> I am wearing them now. feels OK to me. I do not know what my dentist will say.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very difficult to sleep with this mouth guard in your mouth. I attempted to use a few times, but the guard ends up being too much of a nuisance to sleep in.</li>
            <li> just get a professional one done...i used one, and threw the rest of these grind no more away.  terrible product unfortunately :(</li>
            <li> These will do in a pinch. I&#x27;ve lost my mouth guards 3 times now. I use these for travel so I can&#x27;t lose the expensive NTI from my dentist. They aren&#x27;t hard so it&#x27;s difficult to compare (apples to oranges) but for a temporary solution these work.</li>
            <li> At first I was very hesitant to purchase this item; but I&#x27;ve used up a box of 14 so far. I&#x27;m surprised at how good they work. They don&#x27;t cut me or make my mouth sore. The guard fits pretty well and doesn&#x27;t slip, over all I&#x27;d say that I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> The Grind-No-More night protector works very well for me. I found that I was grinding my teeth as I slept and it was causing problems with wear. I tried a couple other over the counter night guards and found them to be too bulky in my mouth. The Grind-No-More is a good fit for me and does the job!</li>
            <li> For a female with a relatively small jaw, these work great. Big enough to remain in place all night, but small enough to protect my teeth without irritating my gums or altering my bite. As noted by another reviewer, the protectors last remarkably long for a disposeable product.</li>
            <li> They are not big, thick &amp; bulky.  Fit comfortably in the mouth.  I like them also because they are disposable.  Not spending a lot of money on a custom made guard that you may not continue to use.</li>
            <li> Bought these once my dentist attributed my cracked tooth to clenching. Wore them for one month. Went back to see the dentist with more pain and he said this device is definitely just for grinders. He then told me it actually makes clenching worse and that only full mouth or anterior mouth splints should be used for clenchers. Perhaps it&#x27;s an excellent product for grinders, but definitely is not made for clenchers and ended up making my problem worse--not better.</li>
            <li> Comfortable, prevents me from grinding (which I&#x27;ve cracked teeth in the past doing).  Does not irritate my gums which was a problem with others I&#x27;ve tried including a custom dentist created mouth guard.  The only complaint I could possibly have is that it will occasionally slip out of its place which inevitably causes me to have a dream where I&#x27;m chewing gum while munching on the mouth guard.  These are made well enough that they usually survive this nightly chewing nightmare.  This is also cheap enough that tossing the guards after 3 nights is realistic ensuring a clean fresh guard that hasn&#x27;t been chewed or ground to half its original height.</li>
            <li> Product is OK but just does not work for me</li>
            <li> My dentist told me there was evidence I was grinding my teeth and offered to sell me a custom fit guard. It would explain tired/aching jaws and headaches in the morning, but insurance wouldn&#x27;t cover it and I wasn&#x27;t willing to spend the full amount without trying some over the counter solutions first. So I tried these.&lt;br /&gt;I found that these increased the ache in my mouth - I was biting down on these guards almost in reflex to having them in there, or perhaps to try to hold them in place. I didn&#x27;t last more than an hour before I took them out. I tried again the next night but same thing. I also had some gagging reactions.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried anything else as yet but if I find a good solution, I&#x27;ll update this review.</li>
            <li> Extremely uncomfortable. Not worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I was about to order these on Amazon when I found single packs at the Dollar Tree- for a dollar obviously.  I tried it and really think it helped.  Way more comfortable than the one the dentist had made for 400.00.  I&#x27;ll order or buy more.</li>
            <li> Very light and easy to use.  No need to boil before putting in.</li>
            <li> These really help with daytime and nighttime grinding. Love they help with jaw fatigue.</li>
            <li> I constantly woke up with terrible headaches.  Had to keep the migraine medicine on my nightstand.  Ever since I started using Plackers, the headaches stopped.  They are so easy to wear.  Not bulky at all.  Like another reviewer posted, you can use them way beyond the 3 days.  I won&#x27;t go to sleep without these in my mouth ever again.</li>
            <li> This product is junk!</li>
            <li> Have been using them now for about a year.  They work exactly as advertised and are saving my teeth very nicely.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, comfortable.  Disposable.  Great for traveling, if you lose it..you have extras. I can finally sleep without waking up with headache.</li>
            <li> Update: It&#x27;s been a month and I still adore them. I wear them under my top teeth for a more comfortable fit, but they are just the most amazing little things. I sleep so much better now. Granted, with my breath right strip and the teeth protector I feel a bit like I did back in my braces days, but I wouldn&#x27;t trade it for one night. I sleep like a baby now, and no more headaches :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow. First night down and yeah it felt a little weird, but I could use it on the top teeth or the bottom teeth and I slept fine without it getting in the way or falling out. There was ZERO adjustment issues with this thing. Open the individual packs, tested it under my top teeth, flipped it over onto my bottom teeth because it was more comfortable and voila! Done. no scraping, pinching, spit buildup-no anything just a nice piece that fit over my molars to protect against the nightly grind.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely noticed a difference this morning in how my jaw felt too which was just unbelievably nice.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update the post later if it starts to perform less than stellar, but if the first night went this well it will only get better as I continue to get used to the feeling.</li>
            <li> These are pretty basic, I like that they are thin and no gagging however they are a one time use.</li>
            <li> These saved my life. 500 dollar bite guards from the dentist are way less comfortable than these. They work, plus you can still talk/kiss with them on! I have such bad grinding at night and these have made my AM headaches go away. Id give them ten stars if i could. Literally a life saver.</li>
            <li> I have tried others but this one fits my mouth the best.  I would recommend you try if you grind your teeth at night.</li>
            <li> Holy cow!  Wish I had discovered these sooner!&lt;br /&gt;1- They cost just over $1 each (rather than $30 for other kinds of mouthpieces)&lt;br /&gt;2-No boiling (unlike the $30 mouthpieces that you wind up throwing away because they don&#x27;t fit right)&lt;br /&gt;3-Unobtrusive- You can even wear them during the day (you can even talk while wearing it!)&lt;br /&gt;4-Can be worn on top or bottom teeth</li>
            <li> Okay i liked the 600 dollar mouth guard best but the dog ate it. The sixty dollar drugstore model was ok too but the dog got that one also.(dogs name is SLICK and he is that).  This guard keeps my teeth apart, fits perfectly in my mouth,is comfortable, and the dog seems not to like it. It is also reasonably priced, so perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time sleeping with other types of grind guards in my mouth...they were just too big, and it kept me awake.  These are perfect - very small &amp; non-intrusive.  Though the package says to dispose of each one after 2-3 days, I use a single grind guard from this package for weeks, which means this will last you for a very long time. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> After my insurance company declined me for a real mouth guard, I decided to give these a shot. Very affordable and very affective. When I wake up in the morning my teeth feel great and I can actually see deep bite marks in them from me grinding in my sleep. They say to use each one 3 times before throwing away, so you get about a 42 night supply for this low price. It does take a few nights to get used to sleeping with something in your mouth though.</li>
            <li> Used to use other brands with similar shape and I liked it except that it&#x27;s much more expensive.  This gives more protectors, which has softer material for you to chew on.  That&#x27;s fine as you are supposed to replace it every few days!!  Much more economical and hygienic than other brands.</li>
            <li> Light and comfortable.</li>
            <li> As with other mouth guards I have used, the fit is poor and cuts into my gum line. But keeps me from grinding my teeth.</li>
            <li> Supposedly these are to help stop grinding and clenching, but the package says you can&#x27;t use them if you have any jaw pain associated with grinding...orTMJ...or braces. Seriously? So I guess only non-grinders with perfect teeth should use these.</li>
            <li> I like that these are smaller than other types, but the inside of my cheeks are getting torn up.  I&#x27;m going to give it a couple more nights and hope that it gets better.</li>
            <li> These were good, but i had one made at the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Wonderful idea! I often  wake up with a mouth full of blood, and some instances broken teeth not to mention headache every morning,I tried the one that we boil in water and set, but not only they hurt my mouth and never really fit correctly they were expensive , they start to take on odor and have to be replaced often.&lt;br /&gt;this item feels comfortable,I don&#x27;t even know I am wearing it, and it work wonderfully, no more headache, no pain, and no grinding...very few items does what it is made for, but this one really does the job, at least for me.</li>
            <li> Good to use while driving. Have the fear of swallowing at night.</li>
            <li> I only use these when I am stressed and can feel that I will have a grind my teeth kind of night and that is why I choose disposable because then I don&#x27;t have to store and clean anything.  These work great!</li>
            <li> One size doess not fit all</li>
            <li> Awesome, no complaints!</li>
            <li> I tend to grind my teeth alot. I have been using these for over a year. They help without hurting your teeth or being bulky like the normal mouth guards. It&#x27;s nice that you can have a new pair when needed.</li>
            <li> I click my teeth at night and sometimes would wake up from a dream with my jaw clenched tight. I bought Plackers mouth guards hoping to prevent grinding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first night, it worked perfectly. I woke up with the guard in my mouth, feeling fine.&lt;br /&gt;The second night I woke up with no guard. Upon inspecting the bed I found it in the middle of the bed, bone dry. When did it fall out?&lt;br /&gt;This morning, after the third night, I have the worst headache and my bite is so misaligned that I can&#x27;t fully close my mouth. This product works for some people but I am done with it.</li>
            <li> Best product available I have seen or used for teeth grinding. I love the fact that it is discrete and does not cover the front of your teeth.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.  Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I think they are a little too small. Not sure why but I would expect better support. Also, if you&#x27;re not familiar with this product, know that in most cases it means you&#x27;ll sleep with your mouth open and wake up dry...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t listen to negative reviews. This really works and does not bother me a bit while I&#x27;m sleeping. Good luck!</li>
            <li> For the price you pay, I guess plackers are worth it. I debated between the moldable mouth guards and these and decided to go with plackers since theres 14 guards. One piece of advice though: wear it on your bottom teeth because I&#x27;ve come to realize that when you wear it on the top, it falls out while you&#x27;re sleeping (at least for me since I tend to sleep with my mouth open at times). One slight complaint is that theres nights where I grind my teeth really hard and in the morning, it somewhat changed my bite in my mouth. I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s the manufacturers fault, but just a heads up.</li>
            <li> Certainly much cheaper than having the dentist composing an appliance for your teeth!!! Very useful considering the cost and what would have cost if one is to go through the hassle of claiming one through insurance.</li>
            <li> This is really great product for dental guard.</li>
            <li> I clench my teeth really really hard - I&#x27;ve broken two and always get a tremendous headache.  With Plackers, no more.</li>
            <li> Works as described. Clean when you wake up and you can use it for a couple weeks, not days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a teeth grinder for years. I have had the mouth guards molded at the dentist and they whole nine yards. My dog has destroyed a couple of them and they ones she didn&#x27;t after a while just got gross. These seem to work just as good and they are disposable. Big plus they are not bulky like the other mouth guards I&#x27;ve had in the past so I ma a lot less likely to spit it out in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li> These help me not have tooth pain. I was clenching my jaw at night apparently without realizing it.</li>
            <li> As others have noted, these are comfortable, affordable, sanitary, and absolutely do the job!  I&#x27;ll use these from now on!</li>
            <li> They get the job done well but aren&#x27;t the most comfortable thing. However, it could be way worse.</li>
            <li> I have 3 big problems with this product:&lt;br /&gt;1. They are super flimsy. Why not just bite down on any old piece of plastic?&lt;br /&gt;2. One size most definitely does not fit all. The guard was so big that the front connector didn&#x27;t even come close to touching my gums.&lt;br /&gt;3. They should really state in the advertising that this product is NOT ADVISED if you have TMJ. I would have never purchased these had I known.</li>
            <li> I like these a lot. I wish they made a version like this that wasn&#x27;t disposable though. They are kind of pricey for as often as you have to replace them. I can usually get about a good weeks worth of use from one pair, but still, I like how they perform. They aren&#x27;t bulky at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read some people&#x27;s dramatic reviews that they almost choked on them. Well if you have that big of mouth or don&#x27;t constantly clench your teeth throughout the night so they stay put, I would recommend buying a single pair from Walgreens first before investing in a multipack. Just food for thought. I have never choked or had them come loose during the night. I have grinded my teeth for 28 years and so my teeth pretty much stay together through the night. Sometimes I would even wake up with toothaches in my rear molars from clenching so bad, but these really help cushion the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend these!</li>
            <li> Update:  Not sure how many nights I have used this, but it is at least 20+ and I&#x27;m pretty sure a single one will last me 50+ nights as a teeth clencher.  I do not use it every night; mostly when I am feeling a bit stressed or some times if I wake up and find that I have been clenching.  This should be my final review and I&#x27;m pretty happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;first update&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore one of these for maybe a week and did somewhat feel like it changed my bite, as somebody else mentioned.  After wearing it, I had somewhat of a naturally tendency to not clench my teeth, like I used to.  It has now probably been about a week without, and I am probably going to wear it again tonight so I do not clench my teeth.  I may plan to wear it every other night or every few nights, depending on how things go.  Also, for my teeth clenching problem, it seems like I could easily use a single guard for a month if not a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;original&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is after only using it one night, but to counter some other reviews I saw I would like to suggest that one size should fit all.  I was fairly skeptical at first, especially after opening the package to see what they actually looked like, but it does seem fairly well designed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting the guard to fully wrap around my upper or lower set of teeth, but these are designed so that the guard is a bit behind my canines.  The positioning keeps my jaw slightly open and any of my teeth from touching each other, so I for one do not have to worry about my teeth clenching problem any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people claimed that it would not stay in position and I can only imagine that being the case if you were somehow chewing on it during your sleep, so they would likely have that problem with anything.  Regardless of the size of your mouth, it should be a pretty tight fit between the outer wall of your mouth and your gums/teeth.  If your mouth is smaller the bite guards are further back, and if it islarger they are closer to the front, but the function and tight/secure fit would seem to be the same for anybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my thoughts on this change I will come back and update this, but I have been concerned about my teeth clenching problem while I sleep for a year or two now and I expect that I will be pretty happy with these.  Unless your teeth are weird and would need a custom designed product regardless, this would probably also work for you.</li>
            <li> Tried these one night and it was obvious within a few hours they weren&#x27;t going to work for me. They sit between two or three sets of molars on each side so all of the pressure is concentrated there. I happen to have a sensitive tooth in the area which quickly became painful. Obviously, a no go. The guards also didn&#x27;t feel especially secure--not sure I wasn&#x27;t clenching my teeth even more to compensate. Clearly no perfect for everyone.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, at the least these are not one size fits all.  I am a grown woman; however, apparently my mouth is too small for these.  I&#x27;ve tried multiple times to make one work, and it just doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> You get your money&#x27;s worth with the plackers mouth guard. It lasts about a week each and it only takes a few days to get used to the rubbery taste and feel. It doesn&#x27;t feel too thick but thick enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t grind, I clench. I rinse and reuse. My dentist thought they were so cool. He hadn&#x27;t seen them before. Hard to find in my area. Very soft and thin, better than any other guards I&#x27;ve tried. Great Product. I would give 5 stars if they weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> Perfect size without having to boil water</li>
            <li> I use these mouth guards religiously.  I wash them out using toothpaste and will use the guard longer than the 3 day recommended allowance. I would recommend them to anyone.  They last a long time and don&#x27;t need to be tossed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One main reason I like them so much is they are not  bulky like the other mouth guards on the market and they last a long time; even though they are recommended for disposble use after three uses.  I have used one guard for several weeks or more. The guard doesn&#x27;t hinder my breathing and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m going to choke on anything.</li>
            <li> These things actually work!  I didn&#x27;t know what to expect but I really like them now.  I like that they are flexible and not a hard rigid guard on your teeth.  They are easy to clean (rinse in water or soak in mouth wash).  I change mine out every week or so.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! I can sleep comfortably with one in. Can be worn on top or bottom teeth.</li>
            <li> Does the job, and is a lot more comfortable and less expensive than other over the counter products I have used. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I think the product is okay, but it&#x27;s not really going to solve the particular problem I&#x27;m having.  I don&#x27;t just grind, I clench.  And that&#x27;s not going to really be prevented by these little guys.  This may work great for others, however.  I&#x27;m just going to have to bite the bullet and go see the dentist.  Bummer!</li>
            <li> I purchased these because I absolutely did not want to spend $600 on a night guard/bite splint that was offered to me at the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;When I am stressed out I grind and clench my jaw while I sleep.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re easy to pop in and they don&#x27;t bother me too much while I sleep.&lt;br /&gt;Some nights I have a harder time getting comfortable with it but this is much better than $600!</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t sure this would work since i typically wear the acrylic one from my dentist, but it&#x27;s great for weekend trips. plus it&#x27;s flexible enough to fit my wider jaw.</li>
            <li> I was tired of using my old invisalign retainers as my mouth guard, so quit using anything and found myself clenching and grinding badly at night.  After just one night of using these I love them!  So innovative!!!  Bravo!!!!</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve run across. I grind my teeth so much that I&#x27;ve had to get multiple drillings on the molars to fix &#x27;em. These work surprisingly well, with no discomfort. Some other guards I&#x27;ve found end up causing your lips to be propped open at night, and you wake up with a very dry mouth - and in the desert, a decent amount of dehydration. No such issues here - they&#x27;re inexpensive and quite effective.</li>
            <li> best grinding guard I ever wore!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dad&#x27;s a dentist &amp; PLACKERS is even better than several custom guards I own.  I&#x27;ve had a retainer with a bite plate between my upper &amp; lower front teeth...was ok, I had a semi flexible/semi rigid full upper custom mouth guard &amp; i would grind &amp; gnash the hell out of it.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think my custom guard actually encouraged me to grind even more b/c it provided so much resistance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love my Plackers.......i hope they never ever ever stop making them.  FINALLY I CAN WAKE UP WITHOUT A SORE JAW &amp; HEADACHE EVERY DAY</li>
            <li> The only night guard I use in my mouth. Comfortable, barely there feel, no noise, no bulk. I spent thousands of dollars worth of custom made anti-grind contraptions &amp; chewed thru them all. I smartened up &amp; use these now. One lasts 7 days for me, or when it&#x27;s chewed thru. I buy 52 to cover an entire year.</li>
            <li> I was previously using SleepRight Dental Guard because of its slim profile, but this is even better. It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s much cheaper than the SleepRight—for about half the price of one night guard, you get 14. The profile is ridiculously slim and much more comfortable. I don&#x27;t find my back teeth touching like one of the other reviews said.</li>
            <li> Works great, didn&#x27;t think they would even looking at them in my hand I was skeptical... I was wrong! they are comfortable and don&#x27;t interfere with my oxygen at all. I cheat and keep a glass of mouthwash next to the bed and have been using one a week - could probably go longer but hey, they are inexpensive. Really a top notch product, they are tiny but you will be surprised how well they work!</li>
            <li> Tldr; This brand does not provide very much protection for us chronic grinders but they are small and great for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Really small design. You can talk and smile and it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;Great for travel. Light weight and who cares if you lose it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I still have headaches after use, on bad nights.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth feel a bit weird after 1 use.&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t really a cheap option if used as directed - 1 mouth guard every 3 days. I probably would not exceed 5-7 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers mentioned that the length is too short, that the guard does not reach all of your teeth. This is definitely true as they do not reach my back molars. I think this length is more ideal than reaching all the way to the back, just personal preference and how my teeth are lined up.</li>
            <li> yes i grind my teeth, sucks, but these are small and you can have them on top or bottom of your mouth, about the only ones i keep in my mouth all night long, took a bit to get use to but they last more then 3 days each, good buy and easy to take on the road with you</li>
            <li> Product is Great. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone with this intense problem.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using night guards and I find myself with More TMJ problems.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great solution.</li>
            <li> wife uses them every night, wish they were colored would make easier to find when she spits them out at night</li>
            <li> This is cheaper than Target, easy to use.  I like that you can use on upper or lower jaw.</li>
            <li> these helped me to stop grinding my teeth at night and even during the day when I would find my self extra stressed out at work.  Though after wearing these for a while it makes you feel like you have a different bite but it corrects itself shortly after having them out of your mouth.</li>
            <li> This is a regular purchase for our household. I wish I could buy them in bulk. I love that they don&#x27;t take up your whole mouth. THere is just enough plastic to keep you from grinding.</li>
            <li> Pros: no boiling, reasonable price, works/does the job&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I do hate using disposable that get thrown in the trash when there are permanent solutions around. Over time its more expensive than other options.</li>
            <li> After a week both my husband and 11 year old son have no complaints and both report less grinding.  I can also report less snoring from the husband!</li>
