            <li>Extreamly effective!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>They seem to think they need to &amp;#34;improve&amp;#34; what was a great product.</li>
            <li>they work great.....</li>

            <li>I enjoy the lemon-lime the very best!</li>
            <li>Easy to chug and go!!</li>
            <li>purchase over 250 items a year from Amazon and always give my honest opinion and rating.&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li>Most flavors are very strong.</li>
            <li>Lemon-lime is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I like this energy drink more than any because I don&#x27;t have to drink 8 ozs to see results.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Lemon Lime seems to sit best on the stomach and honestly tastes better than the other flavors.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found this flavor to taste much better than the original.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, Couldn&#x27;t find this flavor in the local stores in case form.</li>

            <li>only is it cheaper to buy the 12 packs here on Amazon (price per bottle cheaper, no tax) but if you use Subscribe and save you save even more money and are guaranteed to not run out of energy drinks as they come scheduled weekly/monthly/bi monthly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>if I take it and continue to sit that it works much slower.  </li>
            <li>This is really what is says it is.  </li>
            <li>Apparently, this is 5 Hr&#x27;s new and &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; flavor.</li>

            <li> I ordered a case of Lemon Lime flavored 5 hr Energy drinks and was sent a case of Citrus Lime drinks. Apparently, this is 5 Hr&#x27;s new and &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; flavor. That&#x27;s NOT what I ordered. The Citrus Lime flavor is so sweet it Really is undrinkable. I ended up throwing all but one shot away since it was too late to return it. Be careful what you order from 5 Hr. They seem to think they need to &amp;#34;improve&amp;#34; what was a great product.</li>
            <li> I use to do some Montain biking and 5 hour energy is good when trail is too Hard or when I want improve performance</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of 5 Hour Energy as I find it&#x27;s effects to be very subtle. (I am rather large).  I found this flavor to taste much better than the original.</li>
            <li> It works. It keeps you awake when you miss sleep. An my friend who is a night nurse uses it and says, within moderation, it is not bad for you.</li>
            <li> I use these to keep me awake during long days at work.  They&#x27;re great!  Can&#x27;t argue with the price either.  Lemon-lime is my favorite.</li>
            <li> It is fair enough. Good product, good price.</li>
            <li> they work great.....just dont rely on them all the time in leu of sleep!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this product often, but when I need it, it works!  I go out of my way to find the lemon-lime flavor.</li>
            <li> Extreamly effective!!!!!!!! I cant stop running Ultra Marathons and and I got a job at the local power plant as a generator!!!!! This is the &amp;#34;Form of fusion&amp;#34; Morpheus was talking about in The Matrix!!! All the power You&#x27;ll ever need!!!</li>
            <li> This flavor is suttle. Most flavors are very strong. Aweful!! Easy to chug and go!! I luv 5 hour!! Drink one a day!! They last me all day. Not just 5 hours</li>
            <li> I have been an avid 5 hour energy drink user for years. It does seem to lose its effectiveness after so long but still gets the job done. Wakes you up and just makes you feel better.&lt;br /&gt;Great alternative to those that like coffee, or don&#x27;t want an amped up sugar drink that makes you crash.&lt;br /&gt;Lemon Lime seems to sit best on the stomach and honestly tastes better than the other flavors.&lt;br /&gt;If you have never had one I suggest drinking 1/2 of a bottle to see if it gives you jitters. These do not need to be refrigerated so you can drink 1/2 now 1/2 later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is it cheaper to buy the 12 packs here on Amazon (price per bottle cheaper, no tax) but if you use Subscribe and save you save even more money and are guaranteed to not run out of energy drinks as they come scheduled weekly/monthly/bi monthly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchase over 250 items a year from Amazon and always give my honest opinion and rating.&lt;br /&gt;5 hour energy earns 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I have been using 5 hour for a good while now and find it works great for me.  I get drowsy at work and this ends those sagging, dozing feelings.  I find though that if I take it and continue to sit that it works much slower.  If I get up and walk around for a while it kicks in faster.  I do not get a sudden burst of energy but find that I just am no longer sleepy.  No jitters or other ill effects.  Try it.</li>
            <li> This is really what is says it is.  Energy with almost no sugar or caffeine.  It provides at least 5 good hours of energy and comes on quickly.  May be helpful with crazy hours at work, long road trips or traveling...</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, Couldn&#x27;t find this flavor in the local stores in case form. So happy with the lemon lime.</li>
            <li> I use 5-hour Energy often</li>
            <li> I like this energy drink more than any because I don&#x27;t have to drink 8 ozs to see results.  In fact, usually 1/2 the bottle per day is perfect for me.  I enjoy the lemon-lime the very best!</li>
            <li> This product help me a lot with my energy</li>
