            <li> these are half the price of sanex strips, the do the same thing they have a different feel they are rougher than the sanex and maybe a little shorter</li>
            <li> They are a tad bit stiffer than Sanex but other than that they are the same quality at half the price.</li>
            <li> Allow at least a week, or so for complete access.</li>
            <li> Been disappointed with a certain company&#x27;s neck strips for a while, and was surprised to find another company that makes a similar product.</li>
            <li> softer than the other brand</li>
            <li> They work as well as other brands &amp; cost less.</li>
            <li> The only negative I have, is the length of time for shipping.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to waste time &amp; gas going to get it!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> They work great,great deal.</li>
            <li> Product is unsatisfactory. Length of item is too small to fit around most men&#x27;s necks, product disintegrates when it gets wet.</li>
            <li> Very good quality and even better price. There&#x27;s no reason to buy anything more expensive than this to just throw in the trash after every client.</li>
            <li> Great product and great seller</li>
            <li> softer than the other brand</li>
            <li> good stuff I but again like always</li>
            <li> these are half the price of sanex strips, the do the same thing they have a different feel they are rougher than the sanex and maybe a little shorter but i haven&#x27;t had one tore when pulling out of the neck strip holder</li>
            <li> Whatever it is made of seems to not make the kids happy. The adults don&#x27;t say anything but they grab at their neck showing discomfort</li>
            <li> I have always bought Sanex neck strips but they continue to get more expensive  so when I saw this brand I thought I would give them a try.  They are a tad bit stiffer than Sanex but other than that they are the same quality at half the price.</li>
            <li> Great amount for a low price</li>
            <li> Very happy to find these, the price is great &amp; they are strong enough to put around a customers nect.</li>
            <li> Work as good as any others.</li>
            <li> Itchy and scratchy. Tossed the whole pack in the recycle bin.</li>
            <li> Been disappointed with a certain company&#x27;s neck strips for a while, and was surprised to find another company that makes a similar product. Ordered a box to try and am very pleased with the Dream strips. They don&#x27;t rip when you pull them out of the holder or when you stretch them before putting them around a customer&#x27;s neck. Will order more when I am out of the other brand and would highly recommend these to any barber fed up with the more expensive, lower quality brand.</li>
            <li> Grwat and comfortable for the neck and catchesall the hair,ggreat product to experience!</li>
            <li> Fast shipment good quality</li>
            <li> Best value for your money! The only negative I have, is the length of time for shipping. Allow at least a week, or so for complete access. For a product to result in its sudden final destination of trash, it&#x27;s an excellent purchase.</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because quality wise it is good but it keeps coming out from the customers neck. There is no adhesive for both ends to stick together. it has to be tucked in to one another</li>
            <li> I bought this for my friend who has a barbering shop and he loves it so much. I think its a good purchase because my friend ask me to buy him a third box of these strip</li>
            <li> Great for price would recommend to every barber. Would definitely start using these from now on. Great purchase changed my life</li>
            <li> We have been using these in our barber shop for years now. They work as well as other brands &amp; cost less.</li>
            <li> These work just as well as the bigger name brands but save you lots of money! We highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> perfect for the cap size</li>
            <li> very nice i will buy again</li>
            <li> Great price and nice strips.</li>
            <li> Works just as good as a more expensive brand I used to use. Now I don&#x27;t have to waste time &amp; gas going to get it!</li>
            <li> Works cool for the price</li>
            <li> Awesome deal and great quality!</li>
            <li> As expected for a great price</li>
            <li> I wouldve enjoyed more if there was the black option. But hygiene is everything so im not complaining. Great product.</li>
            <li> Love em. Comes with hella too. Buy itðŸ˜Ž</li>
