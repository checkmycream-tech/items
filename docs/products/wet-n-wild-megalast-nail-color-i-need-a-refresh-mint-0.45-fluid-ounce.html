    <ol>
            <li>Brush\\&quot; is the best I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li>Happy polishing!</li>
            <li>Perfect color for the summer.</li>
            <li>The brush is great, and the color is perfect mint.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s gorgeous!</li>
            <li>The perfect minty color &amp; the brush is fantastic as well!!</li>
            <li>Great polish.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely gorgeous.</li>
            <li>The formula is really good in that it isn&#x27;t runny or messy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once it&#x27;s on it stays on good.</li>
            <li>The perfect shade of robin&#x27;s egg blue, and the perfect price.</li>
            <li>Very refreshing.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this color!</li>
            <li>Please come out with more colors!</li>
            <li>but I received this as a gift and love it!</li>
            <li>Really pretty colors, nice coverage, and best of all price.</li>
            <li>Nice polish and service.</li>
            <li>I could never do the five strokes or so to form a nice, even coat.</li>
            <li>The top coat will keep your manicure longer and give good shine.</li>
            <li>This is the kind of brush</li>
            <li>Nice polish.</li>
            <li>I already own the shade called 2% Milk</li>
            <li>Essie had a nice color, &amp;#34;in the cab-ana&amp;#34;, but $8.50 a pop?</li>
            <li>My new favorite summer shade!!!</li>
            <li>The color is gorgeous, goes in easily with one application, and doesn&#x27;t chip overly easy.</li>
            <li>This particular shade is great, also a nice brush as well.</li>
            <li>I am VERY impressed with this \\&quot;low end\\&quot; nail polish.  </li>
            <li>Love this color for Spring and Summer.</li>
            <li>I love the color and consistency.  </li>
            <li>The marks would then bug me, and I would then go over it with more paint/ another coat even if that wasn&#x27;t the opaqueness I wanted.</li>
            <li>The thing to spend the money on is the top coat.</li>
            <li>I love this color.  </li>
            <li>precision brush is actually the best part of the nail color.</li>
            <li>I think their precision brush is AWWESOME :)</li>
            <li>I am good with a polish brush, but far from great (see the incredible manicures done by the smart and artful Michelle, the Australian PhD science student on her LabMuffin blog--extraordinary!).</li>
            <li>on my first day, I received so many compliments!</li>
            <li>I find that the brush makes it so easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t chip easily either.</li>
            <li>Not understanding why I would pay you $5.00 when Walgreen&#x27;s had them on sale $.99, with a buy two get one free.</li>
            <li>Best nail polish ive ever gotten, i got one at the beach because it was only $1 and was surprised i loved it so much</li>
            <li>And I have to say this is by far one of the best colors and better quality nail polish I&#x27;ve ever used (and within such a cheap price!).&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>, max two strokes -- much easier to make that perfect looking coat, then you can decide if you need that second coat at all.</li>
            <li>It is very rare to find a color that isn&#x27;t opaque in two coats...</li>
            <li>Contrary to what a reviewer said about the new brush, I love it!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Their other color, 2% Milk is gorgeous!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really, really impressed with this polish and am starting to rethink my opinion that cheap&#x3D;low quality, because apparently that&#x27;s not always the case.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very opaque, creamy and great for the summer months.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely repurchase this.</li>
            <li>So many of my sun dresses have this color mixed in, so glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>If you like super shiny, finish with a glossy topcoat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This went on smooth and vibrant, and true to shade in two coats.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fun item after all, don&#x27;t need to cost $10</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m right handed)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s likely not as easy to make fine</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a really nice color that&#x27;s fun to wear and lasts a long time without ruddiness and discoloration.</li>
            <li>:) I got mine at Dollar General</li>
            <li>/&gt;Happily, WnW Megalast is exactly the right consistency.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve got a Walgreens, CVS, or a supermarket like Meijer around...check there first.</li>
            <li>For me, the polish has been long-lasting brushed over Orly Bonder with a top coat of Seche Vite.</li>
            <li>I purchase two of the shades from 2012, and a pretty frost as well.</li>
            <li>The lasting power is better than my Zoya/OPI ones.</li>
            <li>I do a lot of typing and handsy stuff, so the formula is pretty</li>
            <li>, i had to find it again, its long lasting (on the toes) and its bright and keeps the color you initally put it on as, it stays bright and the thick brush is amazing to apply... for a wet m wild product it really is amazing.</li>
            <li>plan to update this review when I&#x27;m back from vacation to report how it held up at the beach. :)</li>
            <li>The color is really vivid and opaque and you can achieve full opaque nails in 2 coats.</li>
            <li>Very nice and affordable vs other brands where you need several coats in the opaque color to cover your nails.  </li>
            <li>the lowest quality and really only suitable for 13 year old girls.  </li>
            <li>Some don&#x27;t like the wide brush, but I love it.</li>
            <li>really like this range of nail colors.</li>
            <li>Although, it takes a little extra time to dry and chipped easily, its a great color.</li>
            <li>Two coats, both of which dry pretty quickly, and you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li>I mean, it looks amazing in fashion, clean in prints and just overall a very flattering color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This new type of brush calls for one!</li>
            <li>My collection consists of mainly Essie, OPI, China Glaze etc, which can run around $8 a bottle.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>SH Triple Shine, while I love the super shiny color and it covers in one coat, is very thick and takes forever to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually really excited to try the other Megalast colors because at $1.79 a bottle I can get four or five shades for the price I&#x27;d normally pay for one!  </li>
            <li>those out there looking for a summer pink (especially my ladies with tanned skin), the Wet &#x27;n Wild Fergie line &amp;#34;fergalicious&amp;#34; is great.</li>
            <li>I only put 2 coats and 1 top coat and this polish will last until the next time I decide to change colors.</li>
            <li>need a Refresh-Mint is actually less mint and more of that Tiffany blue.</li>
            <li>The brush is wide so it coats very even and dries fast.  </li>
            <li>I found pretty much an exact match on the Wet n Wild shelf, &amp;#34;I Need A Reresh-Mint&amp;#34;, and at only $1.99 I was sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The finish has a nice subtle shine that&#x27;s a step or two above matte.</li>
            <li>This wet and wild color is minty like the cool mints peppermints or blue moon ice cream shade.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to see in the more expensive bottles of nail polish, and certainly didn&#x27;t expect to find in the cheaper brands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fun color with a slight neon result, but still versatile if you&#x27;re not hanging at the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was running low on cash one day and left my debit/credit cards at home, wanted an Essie shade very similar to this, and saw this for $1.79 and figured I wouldn&#x27;t be out much if it sucked.  </li>
            <li>As far as people who do nail art or French manicures, I could see them not liking the brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little thick, and the brush leaves weird marks if you do a thin-ish coat, but otherwise it&#x27;s an awesome polish.</li>

            <li> They are HUGE, very fluffy, and cut into a round shape at the ends.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent the last 15 years</li>
            <li> Very disappointed that ANY company would put a brush like that on a product and actually think it is a good enough idea to throw out into the world.</li>
            <li> With a base coat, two coats, and a top coat, this is wearing just as long as any of my more expensive polishes.  </li>
            <li> However, I saw the same polish at Walmart this weekend for less than $2.</li>
            <li> It makes them very difficult to control even to paint your nails at all, but free handing a french tip?  </li>
            <li> So, I like the wide brush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like blue or green shades in nail polish</li>
            <li> The brush is wide with a rounded tip.</li>
            <li> $5 is a little silly, seeing that the normal price at CVS is $1.99, but the color is hard to find, and so that alone makes it worth it.</li>
            <li> I took away two stars because the new brushes are the most terrible brushes I&#x27;ve ever worked with.  </li>
            <li> Plus, in the past I&#x27;ve found Essie polish to be watery, requiring several coats to get to opaque.</li>
            <li> formula takes a little while to dry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a firm flat brush with a slightly pointed center.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One coat is enough coverage and it hasn&#x27;t chipped in a few days after heavy dishes and typing.  </li>
            <li> For the love of God though, the current Amazon price of $6 a bottle is quite outrageous.  </li>
            <li> am also obsessed with this nail color from Wet n&#x27; Wild.</li>
            <li> After purchasing a few MegaLast colors at Walgreens, I&#x27;m sticking to this line.</li>
            <li> I did a review previously here if you want to check it out!</li>
            <li> Prior to this new type of applicator, I was a moron at doing my nails.</li>
            <li> A few brands now carry this applicator brush!</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m lazy, that adds up to almost a month.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Not too thin, not too thick.</li>
            <li> Was broken when I received.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>

            <li> Was broken when I received.</li>
            <li> I am VERY impressed with this \\&quot;low end\\&quot; nail polish.  My collection consists of mainly Essie, OPI, China Glaze etc, which can run around $8 a bottle.  I was running low on cash one day and left my debit/credit cards at home, wanted an Essie shade very similar to this, and saw this for $1.79 and figured I wouldn&#x27;t be out much if it sucked.  I&#x27;m really, really impressed with this polish and am starting to rethink my opinion that cheap&#x3D;low quality, because apparently that&#x27;s not always the case. I&#x27;ve spent the last 15 years a makeup snob considering Wet n Wild the lowest quality and really only suitable for 13 year old girls.  This went on smooth and vibrant, and true to shade in two coats. With a base coat, two coats, and a top coat, this is wearing just as long as any of my more expensive polishes.  I&#x27;m actually really excited to try the other Megalast colors because at $1.79 a bottle I can get four or five shades for the price I&#x27;d normally pay for one!  For the love of God though, the current Amazon price of $6 a bottle is quite outrageous.  If you&#x27;ve got a Walgreens, CVS, or a supermarket like Meijer around...check there first.</li>
            <li> Great polish. The color is gorgeous, goes in easily with one application, and doesn&#x27;t chip overly easy. However, I saw the same polish at Walmart this weekend for less than $2. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love this color for Spring and Summer. Very refreshing. Some don&#x27;t like the wide brush, but I love it. I am good with a polish brush, but far from great (see the incredible manicures done by the smart and artful Michelle, the Australian PhD science student on her LabMuffin blog--extraordinary!). So, I like the wide brush. For me, the polish has been long-lasting brushed over Orly Bonder with a top coat of Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely gorgeous. It&#x27;s very opaque, creamy and great for the summer months.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely repurchase this. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Nice polish and service.</li>
            <li> I have used Wet n Wild nail polishes for years.  I love the color and consistency.  It is very rare to find a color that isn&#x27;t opaque in two coats...however...I took away two stars because the new brushes are the most terrible brushes I&#x27;ve ever worked with.  They are HUGE, very fluffy, and cut into a round shape at the ends.  It makes them very difficult to control even to paint your nails at all, but free handing a french tip?  Yeah, forget about it.  I will be looking for products of theirs in the future that do not have the hell-brush.  Very disappointed that ANY company would put a brush like that on a product and actually think it is a good enough idea to throw out into the world.</li>
            <li> Contrary to what a reviewer said about the new brush, I love it! A few brands now carry this applicator brush! I&#x27;m a big fan. Prior to this new type of applicator, I was a moron at doing my nails. I could never do the five strokes or so to form a nice, even coat. The marks would then bug me, and I would then go over it with more paint/ another coat even if that wasn&#x27;t the opaqueness I wanted. This discouraged me from doing my nails! This new type of brush calls for one!, max two strokes -- much easier to make that perfect looking coat, then you can decide if you need that second coat at all. I&#x27;m a fan of Wet &#x27;n Wild also because of the price and the colors. It&#x27;s a fun item after all, don&#x27;t need to cost $10+.  As far as people who do nail art or French manicures, I could see them not liking the brush. It&#x27;s likely not as easy to make fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those out there looking for a summer pink (especially my ladies with tanned skin), the Wet &#x27;n Wild Fergie line &amp;#34;fergalicious&amp;#34; is great. It&#x27;s a fun color with a slight neon result, but still versatile if you&#x27;re not hanging at the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. The thing to spend the money on is the top coat. The top coat will keep your manicure longer and give good shine. I still look for deals though here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The coverage from the \\&quot;Manicurve Pro Brush\\&quot; is the best I&#x27;ve ever seen. One swipe covers the entire nail with even coverage. This is the kind of brush I&#x27;d like to see in the more expensive bottles of nail polish, and certainly didn&#x27;t expect to find in the cheaper brands. $5 is a little silly, seeing that the normal price at CVS is $1.99, but the color is hard to find, and so that alone makes it worth it. The perfect shade of robin&#x27;s egg blue, and the perfect price. My new favorite summer shade!!!</li>
            <li> This wet and wild color is minty like the cool mints peppermints or blue moon ice cream shade.  Looks identical to the Tiffany and Co. blue shade of their boxes .  The brush is wide so it coats very even and dries fast.  One coat is enough coverage and it hasn&#x27;t chipped in a few days after heavy dishes and typing.  I love this color.  Very nice and affordable vs other brands where you need several coats in the opaque color to cover your nails.  I will buy this shade again and always like wet n wild for the diversity of colors and the price.  5 stars</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this color! It&#x27;s a little thick, and the brush leaves weird marks if you do a thin-ish coat, but otherwise it&#x27;s an awesome polish. :) I got mine at Dollar General but you can find it at CVS and Walgreen&#x27;s as well. Happy polishing!</li>
            <li> After purchasing a few MegaLast colors at Walgreens, I&#x27;m sticking to this line. I always get compliments when I wear this color. I only put 2 coats and 1 top coat and this polish will last until the next time I decide to change colors. When I&#x27;m lazy, that adds up to almost a month. Seriously. Plus, they are among the cheapest nail polishes at any drugstore for $1.99 a bottle. Please come out with more colors!</li>
            <li> This is part of the 2012 line. Really pretty colors, nice coverage, and best of all price. This particular shade is great, also a nice brush as well. So many of my sun dresses have this color mixed in, so glad I purchased it. Not understanding why I would pay you $5.00 when Walgreen&#x27;s had them on sale $.99, with a buy two get one free. I purchase two of the shades from 2012, and a pretty frost as well. Nice polish.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t order this, but my mom bought it for me. The brush is great, and the color is perfect mint. Although, it takes a little extra time to dry and chipped easily, its a great color.</li>
            <li> Mint is essentially the prettiest cool-girl color ever. I mean, it looks amazing in fashion, clean in prints and just overall a very flattering color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also obsessed with this nail color from Wet n&#x27; Wild. I already own the shade called 2% Milk and it&#x27;s gorgeous! Yikes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need a Refresh-Mint is actually less mint and more of that Tiffany blue. The color is really vivid and opaque and you can achieve full opaque nails in 2 coats. The formula is really good in that it isn&#x27;t runny or messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The precision brush is actually the best part of the nail color. I find that the brush makes it so easy to apply. It&#x27;s a firm flat brush with a slightly pointed center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula takes a little while to dry so you have to be patient. Once it&#x27;s on it stays on good. The lasting power is better than my Zoya/OPI ones. Doesn&#x27;t chip easily either. Pictured above is the mani that&#x27;s been about 3 days. I do a lot of typing and handsy stuff, so the formula is pretty tough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a really nice color that&#x27;s fun to wear and lasts a long time without ruddiness and discoloration. This is 2 coats of color and you can see its opacity right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this range of nail colors. I think their precision brush is AWWESOME :)&lt;br /&gt;Their other color, 2% Milk is gorgeous! I did a review previously here if you want to check it out!</li>
            <li> Best nail polish ive ever gotten, i got one at the beach because it was only $1 and was surprised i loved it so much, i had to find it again, its long lasting (on the toes) and its bright and keeps the color you initally put it on as, it stays bright and the thick brush is amazing to apply... for a wet m wild product it really is amazing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like blue or green shades in nail polish but I received this as a gift and love it! The perfect minty color &amp; the brush is fantastic as well!!</li>
            <li> I recently bought this from my local Rite Aid pharmacy for $1.99! And I have to say this is by far one of the best colors and better quality nail polish I&#x27;ve ever used (and within such a cheap price!).&lt;br /&gt;Just on my first day, I received so many compliments! Perfect color for the summer.</li>
            <li> My fav nail polish color!</li>
            <li> So I was in a well-known drug store today perusing nail polishes for my upcoming beach vacation. Essie had a nice color, &amp;#34;in the cab-ana&amp;#34;, but $8.50 a pop? Yikes. Plus, in the past I&#x27;ve found Essie polish to be watery, requiring several coats to get to opaque. Ain&#x27;t nobody got time for that! I found pretty much an exact match on the Wet n Wild shelf, &amp;#34;I Need A Reresh-Mint&amp;#34;, and at only $1.99 I was sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually try a polish on my left thumbnail first (I&#x27;m right handed) to see how it looks before doing my toes. The brush is wide with a rounded tip. If you&#x27;ve ever used Sally Hansen Triple Shine polish, it&#x27;s the same brush. SH Triple Shine, while I love the super shiny color and it covers in one coat, is very thick and takes forever to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happily, WnW Megalast is exactly the right consistency. Not too thin, not too thick. Two coats, both of which dry pretty quickly, and you&#x27;re done. The trick with the brush is not to overload it. The finish has a nice subtle shine that&#x27;s a step or two above matte. If you like super shiny, finish with a glossy topcoat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to update this review when I&#x27;m back from vacation to report how it held up at the beach. :)</li>
