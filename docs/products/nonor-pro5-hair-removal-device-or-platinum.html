            <li> thin, fine hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess if you rub it across you skin long enough the hair will rub off from friction.</li>

            <li> There&#x27;s a lot of bad reviews about nono out there, but honestly if you just follow the direction and don&#x27;t expect miracles it works!&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give one of the wide tips a try Wednesday</li>
            <li> Go over the same are 3 or 4 times but no more</li>
            <li> I just watched the TV advertisement again today which clearly shows false advertising</li>
            <li> Also did not received the little case to keep it in.</li>
            <li> I have had the No No for a few years.  </li>
            <li> Shave a few days before you use nono and don&#x27;t shave again.</li>
            <li> doing this every time you have stubble and your coarse hairs will eventually become thin.</li>
            <li> Then I put in the narrow tip and went into the bathroom, and gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping to use the narrow tip for my &amp;#34;shaving tip.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> They burn off your current body hair which smells bad &amp; is about the same growback as shaving.</li>
            <li> I love the No No.  Waxing is so painful and expensive getting done couple times a month.  </li>
            <li> Not sure yet if it works</li>
            <li> not satisfied with it</li>
            <li> My wife is not pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> This thing doesn&#x27;t do a darn thing ,don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> No do at least for me is to make the hairs thinker and took longer time to grback.  </li>
            <li> Each treatment leaves behind prickly stubble&lt;</li>
            <li> and I was shocked because they were crystalized hairs</li>
            <li> What a disappointment!  </li>
            <li> in the maximum power set up, is not even removing the hair from my forearm, it does not perform as advertised, the worst, is a  scam, do not bye this ever</li>
            <li> The hair is burned off and emits a disgusting odor</li>
            <li> This is the worst investment I have ever made!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> All you have to do is go read the reviews on HSN.com&lt;br /&gt;They have been selling it for years and the ratings have NEVER been good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be fooled by the television hype. It is all lies! It does not remove hair and it will burn your skin.</li>
            <li> in the maximum power set up, is not even removing the hair from my forearm, it does not perform as advertised, the worst, is a  scam, do not bye this ever</li>
            <li> it takes forever if u dont shave first and u got to put the level up more if u want faster results</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t work as good as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> thank you for the speedy delivery and what a good price</li>
            <li> According to the TV advertisement no!no!  will remove hair as it is used.  The TV advertisement shows a man with a bald patch of hair on his arm and the woman using this product on her face leads you to believe that the hair is being removed as she is using it.  I ordered this product directly from no!no!, which by the way is over $300, and used it several times on my legs and face, not one hair was removed.  I called customer service to return the product and was told that the no!no! does NOT remove hair immediately....as it is used over and over for weeks, the hair will become finer and will not grow back once YOU have removed it via shaving, plucking and/or buffing.  The customer service person told me that the no!no! would not remove hair during use, but that I would need to use the no!no! and then proceed to remove the hair as I have been.  I just watched the TV advertisement again today which clearly shows false advertising and I will be returning this unit tomorrow!</li>
            <li> I received this yesterday. II charged it all night. Will not come on. Also did not received the little case to keep it in.</li>
            <li> I love the No No.  Waxing is so painful and expensive getting done couple times a month.  I have had the No No for a few years.  Only used off and on but decided to really start using it more.  What I have seen No No do at least for me is to make the hairs thinker and took longer time to grback.  I actually buffed after using it today and seen missed hairs so I used my tweezers to get off and I was shocked because they were crystalized hairs and they just came off so easy when tweeze.  I use it on my face primarly because I do not want to shave there.</li>
            <li> Not sure yet if it works</li>
            <li> The replace tip light comes on and I only used it for 5 minutes.  I would return it if I could.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt and if it worked I would probably like it.</li>
            <li> Trying to return the product.  not satisfied with it</li>
            <li> It is ok but not completly impressed</li>
            <li> This product is not what they proclaim it to be.  My wife is not pleased with it.  Wasn&#x27;t worth the money I spent.</li>
            <li> Not as easy to use as the advert. Works best on stubble</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot of bad reviews about nono out there, but honestly if you just follow the direction and don&#x27;t expect miracles it works!&lt;br /&gt;1. Make sure you exfoliate!&lt;br /&gt;2. Shave a few days before you use nono and don&#x27;t shave again. You want barely a stubble. (The direction say 1 to 3 mm but stick to 1.)&lt;br /&gt;3. Start out slowly until you get the hang of it, then it should be pretty easy.&lt;br /&gt;4. Go over the same are 3 or 4 times but no more or you might get irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;5. Buffer and lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep doing this every time you have stubble and your coarse hairs will eventually become thin. You will notice on your first try that the nono immediately gets rid of thin, fine hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it! Enjoy.</li>
            <li> I wish that I had read the No No Pro reviews before ordering mine. I also wish I&#x27;d bought it from Amazon because then I could get my money back. As it is, I ordered it from a company that charged $149 and that has ignored my repeated requests for my money back. The TV ads for No No hair removal are totally misleading. I have found that&lt;br /&gt;• No No burns the skin on my face especially where I have wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;• The hair is burned off and emits a disgusting odor&lt;br /&gt;• Each treatment leaves behind prickly stubble&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my experience, No No Pro is an advertising fraud. It&#x27;s bogus. Avoid it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but not as easy or thorough as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> The No! No! I a complete rip off. I guess if you rub it across you skin long enough the hair will rub off from friction. The hot wire is not going to get it done.</li>
            <li> My face between upper lip and nose was red but hair remained even after trying stronger setting.</li>
            <li> This is the worst investment I have ever made! This thing doesn&#x27;t do a darn thing ,don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Well, my No No came in shortly after noon today.  I watched the DVD and read the instructions as the No No was charging, which took about 90 minutes to charge it.  Then I put in the narrow tip and went into the bathroom, and gave it a try.  The wire in the narrow tip lasted maybe 2 minutes before the red light came on - and this was on hair that I shave, on my neck.  I hope AirUtiopia.com does the right thing and replaces this tip.  It&#x27;s obvious the first one wasn&#x27;t quite &amp;#34;up to par&amp;#34; to the others.  I haven&#x27;t tried any of the others yet, since I shaved this morning.  I&#x27;ll give one of the wide tips a try Wednesday about 4 P. M.  I was hoping to use the narrow tip for my &amp;#34;shaving tip.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;ll keep y&#x27;all posted.  Ric</li>
            <li> It did not work as advertised.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment!  Doesn&#x27;t work well at all.</li>
            <li> None of these items work for permanent hair removal. They burn off your current body hair which smells bad &amp; is about the same growback as shaving. Returned for a refund; better to search for Groupons &amp; invesr for laser hair removal that lasts 2-5 yrs with less regiment.</li>
