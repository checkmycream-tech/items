            <li>Threw it away, wrote Amazon we did not get the full order and never heard from them until today when they requested a review.</li>
            <li>Great price for a nail clipper and is quite sharp.</li>
            <li>especially your toes thank you so much by not discontinuing the product good materials</li>
            <li>this junk does not rate a capitol letter!&lt;br /&gt;Not worth your time.</li>
            <li>Not even worth a score of one.  </li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s right</li>
            <li>...get right up to the cuticle.  </li>
            <li>They do not cut right.</li>
            <li>As a pianist, full of passion, let your nails short, in good condition is essential.</li>
            <li>I have a pair that I bought locally and LOVE.</li>
            <li>I love the La Cross brand of this slant edge clippers</li>
            <li>I would just somewhere more closer to home to order them from next time.  </li>
            <li>I was just so glad to finally find them that I over looked where I was ordering them from, that&#x27;s all.  </li>
            <li>They are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>exactly...</li>
            <li>Let me first say I really like the design of slanted edge clippers...</li>
            <li>Those large clippers would just hack away</li>
            <li>1 pair was OK and the 2 other pairs I only have as an if absolutely needed pair since they don&#x27;t cut very clean</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>These have turned out to be VERY helpful.</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied</li>
            <li>These cut really well</li>
            <li>These are just as good as other ones I have bought and will continue to buy this type only...</li>
            <li>You have to clip multiple times to get a clean cut.</li>
            <li>nice little clipper and the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li>Out of the dozen I ordered, 2 have a decent tip.</li>
            <li>Sharp and easy to handle</li>
            <li>Would probably work nicely for babies too, or if you just have a hard time reaching toe nails too I suppose.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money, spend more elsewhere and get something that works.</li>
            <li>The clipping &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; I guess you&#x27;d call them, don&#x27;t even live up.</li>
            <li>Not very sharp, doesn&#x27;t work very well for hangnails or cuticle trims as described.</li>
            <li>When I looked for a new one, I could not find this nail clipper anywhere near my home.</li>
            <li>they could not be more dull...</li>
            <li>These slanted edge clippers are the only ones which really work--those blunt, rounded edge ones just create disaster.</li>
            <li>Not sharp at all!</li>
            <li>this was not sharp at all</li>
            <li>They are not sharp</li>
            <li>They are not sharp.</li>
            <li>I generally have my toe nail growing into my skin.  </li>
            <li>It is, but really good, as part of a series of cutting tools, there is a small useful items.</li>
            <li>When the clippers came in both pair were not sharp enough to cut my cuticle.</li>
            <li>They are not sharp enough to cut fingernails let alone toe nails.</li>
            <li>They r not sharp enough</li>
            <li>Sharp, decent product.</li>
            <li>Never realized I needed these smart little clippers until I tried them.  </li>
            <li>but, like most similar instruments, it&#x27;s awkward and hard to use accurately, .</li>

            <li> but, like most similar instruments, it&#x27;s awkward and hard to use accurately, .</li>
            <li> You actually have to be careful not to cut too much as these are quite sharp.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes the straighter edged clipper just can&#x27;t reach certain places where this clipper can get into delicate areas.</li>
            <li> , it took quite a long time to receive these in the mail.  </li>
            <li> Not very sharp or clean cutting.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that they were sharp enough.  </li>
            <li> was ground back to make a slight flat surface before it was plated and shipped.</li>
            <li> It is average for similar tools.  </li>
            <li> junky wont even cut a cuticle, will continue the search here locally wont buy again not worth returning.</li>
            <li> You will end up pressing down multiple times just to cut a nail.</li>
            <li> This really helps in cutting that extra nail, the curved tip helps to cut the  toe nail with less pain, the normal nail cutter doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Needed to replace the pair I had, but this pair is not as user friendly and definitely not as sharp! :(</li>
            <li> The product is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Each clipper has a bur right where you would cut so they are useless to use as they don&#x27;t cut</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not as sharp as I wish it were.</li>
            <li> Sharp and works well.</li>
            <li> Big disappointment.i have had clippers like these in the past that worked well.</li>
            <li> I bought 4 pairs and the quality was not consistent from pair to pair.  </li>
            <li> They are sharp and cut well.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews and said hey, for the price let me try it.</li>
            <li> poorly made, Seemed to be offrered as being similar to the ones made by Cross, but not.</li>
            <li> They are terrible, not sharp like my pair, and the tips are much more blunted, almost like the tips were cut.</li>
            <li> Not worth the hassle of returning them.  </li>
            <li> With delayed shipping and  inferior quality,  this product is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a poorly made clipper, it doesn&#x27;t even clip right as it&#x27;s blades are uneven and dull.  </li>
            <li> The tip of the clipper is really dull and flat.  </li>
            <li> Jaws are poorly ground and only contact each other at the tip.</li>
            <li> This one the cutting edge is much larger and it is not sharp.</li>
            <li> Now I have this little baby</li>
            <li> Took a little time to receive</li>
            <li> /&gt;This seems like a nail clippers and scissors, to encourage users to cut, rather than a few buckets.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money.</li>
            <li> I threw all 6 away... waste of money!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> device is very small, although well done, sharp edges, can not be cut particularly thick nails or nails.</li>
            <li> It took forever for the shipping and it is so dull it doesn&#x27;t even cut.  </li>
            <li> I ordered three and all three are dull.</li>
            <li> I can hardly cut any cuticles with these.  </li>
            <li> They are not aligned, you can see gaps in the cutting head when you press the clip down and it isn&#x27;t sharp.</li>
            <li> They handled small cuts but any thick nail will snap these clippers!</li>
            <li> Not good quality.</li>
            <li> no good</li>
            <li> These clippers were very dull.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product at all.</li>
            <li> the cutting edges are dull and do not trim the cuticles.</li>
            <li> Sadly, the quality is poor, and I would not order them again.  </li>
            <li> Well, I bought 4 pair figuring how bad can they be, I will get one or two goop pair at least.</li>
            <li> Too difficult to get used to</li>
            <li> I decided to return mine within minutes of opening and discovering how flawed it was made.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to hear that there are people that found these clippers insufficient.</li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> They are all very poor quality.</li>
            <li> While I received them on time, they are a very poor quality.  </li>
            <li> I found a crowd of integration ciipper from the Clippers into the awkward corners and cut cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cutting blades did not even match up.  </li>
            <li> I did not look at the pic of fingers holding this-too bad for Me.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in the product.</li>

            <li> This did not cut very easily</li>
            <li> Too difficult to get used to and I still haven&#x27;t. Price is good if you need to help fill a trash pail.</li>
            <li> Let me first say I really like the design of slanted edge clippers... I have a pair that I bought locally and LOVE. My ex boyfriend was always trying to steal them from me, which got me wondering what I would do if I ever lost them. I saw these on Amazon and thought I would buy them and have a spare. Well, I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay much for them. They are terrible, not sharp like my pair, and the tips are much more blunted, almost like the tips were cut. They can definitely never replace the pair I&#x27;ve had for years.</li>
            <li> They are cheap and cheaply made... they could not be more dull... I threw all 6 away... waste of money!</li>
            <li> Excellent. I&#x27;ve been using these for many years.  Could no longer find them at any retail stores.  Glad to have them again.</li>
            <li> I love the La Cross brand of this slant edge clippers and I thought I was purchasing this brand up received them in another brand that don&#x27;t clip as well.  I will only purchase the La Cross brand in the future.</li>
            <li> Not very sharp or clean cutting.  I got these to use as cuticle clippers for my fingernails, and they are all but identical to ones I already have but can&#x27;t find in stores any more.  Sadly, the quality is poor, and I would not order them again.  Not worth the hassle of returning them.  Find some better ones, please, Amazon!!</li>
            <li> This is a poorly made clipper, it doesn&#x27;t even clip right as it&#x27;s blades are uneven and dull.  I decided to return mine within minutes of opening and discovering how flawed it was made.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been looking on this product for a long time and my sister told me that its a very good one and she&#x27;s right it&#x27;s easy to use and deliver your nails maintenance especially your toes thank you so much by not discontinuing the product good materials</li>
            <li> I like the slanted tip, great for cuticles but it&#x27;s not as sharp as I wish it were.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to hear that there are people that found these clippers insufficient. I just thought I would add my .02 and say that I have always used these clippers for my cuticles and have found nothing that works as well as these. The problem is I can&#x27;t find them anywhere anymore and when I found them here, I stocked up. They work just great for me...can&#x27;t live without them!</li>
            <li> Thank you for having this product.  I have used this type of clipper for many years.  When I looked for a new one, I could not find this nail clipper anywhere near my home.</li>
            <li> these are the best cuticle trimmer is on the market. They work great for toes and fingers</li>
            <li> this junk does not rate a capitol letter!&lt;br /&gt;Not worth your time. money or review.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money &amp; buy a good one.</li>
            <li> These clippers did not work. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> These are great for clipping sugar glider nails.  Would probably work nicely for babies too, or if you just have a hard time reaching toe nails too I suppose.</li>
            <li> As a pianist, full of passion, let your nails short, in good condition is essential. I have a set of nail clippers, scissors and file, he bought this because it seemed to offer something a bit different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device is very small, although well done, sharp edges, can not be cut particularly thick nails or nails. I found a crowd of integration ciipper from the Clippers into the awkward corners and cut cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seems like a nail clippers and scissors, to encourage users to cut, rather than a few buckets. It is, but really good, as part of a series of cutting tools, there is a small useful items.</li>
            <li> Blades do not cut good. You have to clip multiple times to get a clean cut. Not good quality.</li>
            <li> Sharp and works well.</li>
            <li> I have had a pair of these before and I enjoyed these so well that I needed to order some more.  I didn&#x27;t realize that I had ordered these from another country and now I would pay closer attention to order these from somewhere in America, it took quite a long time to receive these in the mail.  They are good clippers and I&#x27;m glad that I ordered them, I would just somewhere more closer to home to order them from next time.  I was just so glad to finally find them that I over looked where I was ordering them from, that&#x27;s all.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that they were sharp enough.  The tip of the clipper is really dull and flat.  I wouldn&#x27; recommend.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find these in a store anymore...nice little clipper and the price can&#x27;t be beat! I can have one in every vehicle and in every travel case as well as both medicine cabinets.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for oblique clipper for some time and know I have them. I like them a lot.Thanks</li>
            <li> Sharp and easy to handle</li>
            <li> I do pedicures for diabetics I take care of. These have turned out to be VERY helpful. They are very sharp and the blades line up perfectly! VERY glad I bought 2 pair!!</li>
            <li> I generally have my toe nail growing into my skin.  This really helps in cutting that extra nail, the curved tip helps to cut the  toe nail with less pain, the normal nail cutter doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Jaws are poorly ground and only contact each other at the tip. Buy another brand of you want a clipper like this.</li>
            <li> Not very sharp, doesn&#x27;t work very well for hangnails or cuticle trims as described.</li>
            <li> I actually use these as clippers for cuticles and they work wonderfully. Cannot locate them in stores in my city.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t work for cuticles</li>
            <li> These slanted edge clippers are the only ones which really work--those blunt, rounded edge ones just create disaster.</li>
            <li> All three pair of clippers broke when I used them. They handled small cuts but any thick nail will snap these clippers! I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> I brought these for my mother and she is happy with them.  She has told me that they work well.</li>
            <li> poorly made, Seemed to be offrered as being similar to the ones made by Cross, but not.</li>
            <li> Each clipper has a bur right where you would cut so they are useless to use as they don&#x27;t cut</li>
            <li> this was not sharp at all</li>
            <li> LaCrosse used to make cuticle clippers like this, but don&#x27;t anymore. I was hesitant since they were coming from China. I&#x27;m happy to report they work as well my old LaCrosse. I bought several pair so I can gift them to friends.</li>
            <li> When the clippers came in both pair were not sharp enough to cut my cuticle. Still trying to figure out how to sharpen them. Very dissatisfied</li>
            <li> It is average for similar tools.  It does the job but, like most similar instruments, it&#x27;s awkward and hard to use accurately, .</li>
            <li> Nail clippers did not work, I don&#x27;t recommend anyone buying. They are not sharp</li>
            <li> Sharp, decent product.</li>
            <li> Needed to replace the pair I had, but this pair is not as user friendly and definitely not as sharp! :(</li>
            <li> Not even worth a score of one.  I was hoping that they would have been as good as Laross clippers,  but no such luck.  With delayed shipping and  inferior quality,  this product is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> looks cool, but they don&#x27;t work well at all</li>
            <li> These cut really well...get right up to the cuticle.  You actually have to be careful not to cut too much as these are quite sharp.  They are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I did not look at the pic of fingers holding this-too bad for Me.  But the clippers are real good &amp; it works great, just to small for My fingers.</li>
            <li> Great price for a nail clipper and is quite sharp. No issues to date; only aspect is I need to get accustomed to the slanted edge to cut.</li>
            <li> cant find these in stores anymore.  These are great.</li>
            <li> Never realized I needed these smart little clippers until I tried them.  It makes it so easy to clip nails now.  Those large clippers would just hack away and I never knew how my nails would end up looking.  Now I have this little baby and I can be as precise as I need to be, yet they are equally as strong as the others.  Great find!</li>
            <li> I received silver nail clippers but they were not slanted as shown</li>
            <li> I have one that I purchased a while back.  This one the cutting edge is much larger and it is not sharp. I am very disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> the cutting edges are dull and do not trim the cuticles. Big disappointment.i have had clippers like these in the past that worked well.</li>
            <li> I have used slant edge clippers before and I usually love them.  I bought 4 pairs and the quality was not consistent from pair to pair.  Only 1 pair was great 1 pair was OK and the 2 other pairs I only have as an if absolutely needed pair since they don&#x27;t cut very clean and I end up ripping the skin off my cuticles once the clipper is a hold of it.</li>
            <li> No longer found in drug stores, I was glad to find replacements.</li>
            <li> Order a bunch and you might get a good one. Out of the dozen I ordered, 2 have a decent tip. All the rest look like the tip was ground back to make a slight flat surface before it was plated and shipped.</li>
            <li> junky wont even cut a cuticle, will continue the search here locally wont buy again not worth returning. no good</li>
            <li> I purchased these as a filler to my order.  I was very happy when I used them the first time.  They are sharp and cut well.</li>
            <li> The product is not what I expected. They do not cut right. They are ruff on the edge that is by your skin. Not happy with this product at all.</li>
            <li> It took forever for the shipping and it is so dull it doesn&#x27;t even cut.  Don&#x27;t waste your time and money.</li>
            <li> They are not sharp.I ordered three and all three are dull.I would not buy them again.Now I have met the word requirement.</li>
            <li> These are just as good as other ones I have bought and will continue to buy this type only...I do not use regular clippers anymore...this slant edge is the best !!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, very easy to use. In addition, it has a good quality.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Took a little time to receive but once I learned where it was coming from, it was understandable. Would definitely purchase from buyer again.</li>
            <li> Prompt shipping. That is the only good thing I can say. I read other reviews and said hey, for the price let me try it. Well, I bought 4 pair figuring how bad can they be, I will get one or two goop pair at least. Wrong. They are all very poor quality. They are not aligned, you can see gaps in the cutting head when you press the clip down and it isn&#x27;t sharp. Bottom line - they do not work. Don&#x27;t waste your money, spend more elsewhere and get something that works.</li>
            <li> Works well, I like the angular blade</li>
            <li> We ordered the Clippers (two) and only received one. Tried to use it and it would not cut. Threw it away, wrote Amazon we did not get the full order and never heard from them until today when they requested a review. Do NOT purchase theses clippers and I will NEVER use Amazon again.</li>
            <li> Ok, took 1 month to get, my fault did not notice coming from China.</li>
            <li> These clippers were very dull. They are not sharp enough to cut fingernails let alone toe nails. I would not recommend them.</li>
            <li> This was a rip off. Overcharged and didn&#x27;t cut..they also fall apart..i bought 10. None left</li>
            <li> While I received them on time, they are a very poor quality.  I can hardly cut any cuticles with these.  I am disappointed.  Barbara Berman</li>
            <li> These are just rad if you like shaping your nails... just... exactly... so.</li>
            <li> The clipping &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; I guess you&#x27;d call them, don&#x27;t even live up. You can&#x27;t tell they&#x27;re some cheap China made junk.</li>
            <li> They r not sharp enough</li>
            <li> This is an excellent clipper due to slant of clipper . Sometimes the straighter edged clipper just can&#x27;t reach certain places where this clipper can get into delicate areas.</li>
            <li> Its&#x27;s a good price, but it takes about 2 weeks to receive it. If you order this item, order several of them at one time.</li>
            <li> Returned this item as it was cheaply made. The cutting blades did not even match up.  I would not recommend this item.</li>
            <li> This would be best ONLY for cuticles. Not sharp at all! You will end up pressing down multiple times just to cut a nail. Not worth it.</li>
