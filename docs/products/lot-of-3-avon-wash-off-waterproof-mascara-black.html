            <li>Best mascara, never flakes or rubs off</li>
            <li>The brush separates my lashes perfectly and the formula has no clumps.  </li>
            <li>and this stuff is the best.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best mascara in the world.</li>
            <li>Best wash off mascara I have used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve snorkeled with it and it is still perfect.  </li>
            <li>I was very happy to see I could order this from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The 3 pack pricing is a very good deal.</li>
            <li>It is great.</li>
            <li>This is great mascara.</li>
            <li>And the applicator is great too.  </li>
            <li>Great product; no smudging and washes off with soap and water.</li>
            <li>Great with contacts</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Everything came on time, great condition, and I have allergies and this mascara does NOT bother my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Washes off with no problem.</li>
            <li>However, the best part is it washes off easily with no makeup removers.  </li>
            <li>and it still looks good.  </li>
            <li>Holds curls better than any curling mascara I&#x27;ve paid up to $20 a tube for!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this mascara!  </li>
            <li>I love this mascara!</li>
            <li>It works great and although it is waterproof it washes off fairly easy.  </li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best mascara.  </li>
            <li>Great price and quick shipment will order again</li>
            <li>I WILL LOOK YOU UP WHEN ITS TIME TO RE-ORDER - QUICK SHIPPING AND GREAT PRICE</li>
            <li>No clumping and it was very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>The wand perfectly separates your lashes and is soft so it doesn&#x27;t poke you when you apply at the roots.  </li>
            <li>These are by far the best mascara I ever bought.  </li>
            <li>It layers beautifully, lasts all day, is easy to remove, great with my contacts, and looks natural.  </li>

            <li>that&#x27;s for sure</li>
            <li>It goes on each last perfect</li>

            <li>Sure hope Avon doesn&#x27;t discontinue it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m stocked for a while.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THESE -</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>Has always been my favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li>I love it and hope Avon never gets rid of it.  </li>
            <li>I have used this products for many years and LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I worked in a pool at the YMCA and it never ran but washed off easily.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to remove with soap and water.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smudge or run and lasts all day, but washes off easily.</li>
            <li>it stays on when i sweat and in light rain.</li>
            <li>Washes off and leaves no smudges with bar soap lightly smudged across them.  </li>
            <li>As it&#x27;s more complimentary to my&lt;br /&gt;hair and skin coloring.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different mascaras and this one is by far the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too thick and clumpy and the brush is the perfect size</li>
            <li>Came fast and the price was definitely right !!</li>
            <li>Great mascara as it stays on all day &amp; washes off with facial cleanser easily, Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It stays on and then easily washes off with soap and water that part is very true, however, it clumps and takes forever to get a enough on the lash to make the effort worth it.</li>
            <li>I have used this for several years and love it.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s so good that I wear it everyday.  </li>
            <li>But this really works.</li>
            <li>Does not smudge, smear, flake and really separate&#x27;s the lashes.  </li>
            <li>Terrific price and very fresh - not thick or clumpy at all!</li>
            <li>I have tried other mascaras but this is still my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Many other brands irritate my eyes and the Avon Wash-off Waterproof does not.  </li>
            <li>I use an Olay wet wash cloth, which I have used for years, and it takes all of it off easily.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this mascara.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay; it isn&#x27;t clumpy, but not smooth either.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, it was just fair, not great</li>
            <li>Nice and thick with 2 coats.  </li>
            <li>I think this is a new product for Avon</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not been able to get it and have been using $20 tubes of different brands from Ulta as well as every other wash-off waterproof at the drugstore and NONE of them work as well as this one.  </li>
            <li>and it is easy to remove with just a little makeup remover.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that a tube never seems to last quite long enough, but for a mascara that goes on easily, lasts pretty much all day, and stays at a good consistency until it&#x27;s empty, I&#x27;ll take it.</li>
            <li>Boy was I surprised with this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>Never runs, and completely washes off with ease.</li>
            <li>both high and low end -</li>
            <li>The only positive suggestion I have for Avon is to&lt;br /&gt;please bring back the Brown/Black.  </li>
            <li>It also makes your lashes look long and lush.</li>
            <li>So often the formula is good but the brush is bad or vice versa.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It was a little dry (seems like may be old).</li>
            <li> Hard to find directly from AVON.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d say it crumbles when wet, rather than runs, which i find preferable.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t run when wet but will flake if wet and then rubbed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually wear waterproof mascara and only bought it for our trip to Hawaii</li>
            <li> It was a little too wet for my liking.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally buy waterproof mascara, as it&#x27;s often difficult and messy to remove.  </li>
            <li> this washes away with a little rubbing in the pool or shower, and doesnt leave me looking like rocky raccoon.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have any trouble applying it.</li>
            <li> Even though the mascara was sealed, it was clumpy and dried out.</li>
            <li> Will be stocking up as I find it hard to come by.</li>
            <li> The Avon mascara doesn&#x27;t clump, unlike some that get very thick after a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> i have used a couple waterproof mascaras that stayed on in the pool, in bed, for three days, but when i wanted to remove it, it broke and pulled my lashes and required serious scrubbing.</li>
            <li> and if they ever quit making it I&#x27;m going have a serious problem.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed that Avon has discontinued this product.</li>
            <li> and I hate by the end of the day I look like a raccoon.</li>
            <li> and it is terrible.  </li>

            <li> Hard to find directly from AVON. Terrific price and very fresh - not thick or clumpy at all!</li>

            <li> Can&#x27;t believe this has been discontinued.  It is great.</li>
            <li> I have used the Avon wash-off waterproof mascara for 20 some years. I worked in a pool at the YMCA and it never ran but washed off easily. No clumping and it was very easy to apply.  It goes on evenly. I am disappointed that Avon has discontinued this product.</li>
            <li> It was a little too wet for my liking. I prefer a thicker mascara. Otherwise, it was just fair, not great</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally buy waterproof mascara, as it&#x27;s often difficult and messy to remove.  The Avon mascara doesn&#x27;t clump, unlike some that get very thick after a few weeks.

            <li> this has been my mascara of choice since i moved to florida three years ago. i needed something that didn&#x27;t run, but didn&#x27;t go on like asphalt. i have used a couple waterproof mascaras that stayed on in the pool, in bed, for three days, but when i wanted to remove it, it broke and pulled my lashes and required serious scrubbing. this washes away with a little rubbing in the pool or shower, and doesnt leave me looking like rocky raccoon. it stays on when i sweat and in light rain. i&#x27;d say it crumbles when wet, rather than runs, which i find preferable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay; it isn&#x27;t clumpy, but not smooth either.  It works, but is not one of my favorites. I will not purchase again; there are better brands out there.</li>
            <li> Best mascara, never flakes or rubs off and it&#x27;s easy to remove with soap and water. It also makes your lashes look long and lush.</li>
            <li> Stays on until you wash it off.  This is great mascara.</li>
            <li> Truly waterproof but comes off with soap.  The wand perfectly separates your lashes and is soft so it doesn&#x27;t poke you when you apply at the roots.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different mascaras and this one is by far the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara forever. I have used this for several years and love it.  Great price and quick shipment will order again that&#x27;s for sure</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best mascara.  I&#x27;ve not been able to get it and have been using $20 tubes of different brands from Ulta as well as every other wash-off waterproof at the drugstore and NONE of them work as well as this one.  The brush separates my lashes perfectly and the formula has no clumps.  It goes on each last perfect and I can just add layers for thickness.  Holds curls better than any curling mascara I&#x27;ve paid up to $20 a tube for!  Washes off and leaves no smudges with bar soap lightly smudged across them.  Cleansers and eye makeup removers don&#x27;t work well at getting it off.  Will be stocking up as I find it hard to come by.</li>
            <li> I love the mascara but I won&#x27;t it in Brown.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for twenty years. The 3 pack pricing is a very good deal. Sure hope Avon doesn&#x27;t discontinue it. Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every mascara out there - both high and low end - and this stuff is the best.  It is the only Avon product I use and if they ever quit making it I&#x27;m going have a serious problem.  It layers beautifully, lasts all day, is easy to remove, great with my contacts, and looks natural.  You can wear it all day and then put another layer on in the evening to go out and it still looks good.  And the applicator is great too.  So often the formula is good but the brush is bad or vice versa.  This has both nailed.  I&#x27;ve worn it for years and will never stop.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Avon Wash-Off mascara for almost 20 years.  Great product; no smudging and washes off with soap and water.</li>
            <li> Boy was I surprised with this mascara.  I don&#x27;t usually wear waterproof mascara and only bought it for our trip to Hawaii, it&#x27;s so good that I wear it everyday.  No clumping and it is easy to remove with just a little makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought Avon&#x27;s wash off water proof mascara for years. It&#x27;s the best mascara in the world. Yes, I&#x27;ve tried department store mascaras. I wear it while i swim and doesn&#x27;t smear but washes with soap with ease.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t run when wet but will flake if wet and then rubbed.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes and I hate by the end of the day I look like a raccoon. But this really works. I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m stocked for a while.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE - I ALWAYS STOCK UP ON THESE - I KOW I WILL LOOK YOU UP WHEN ITS TIME TO RE-ORDER - QUICK SHIPPING AND GREAT PRICE</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  Could not order from Avon as they have discontinued this one, so I bought 3 to last a while.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara!  Never runs, and completely washes off with ease.</li>
            <li> Best wash off mascara I have used. Great with contacts</li>
            <li> Bought these because Avon has discontinued this product.  Has always been my favorite mascara.  Doesn&#x27;t clump or flake and is definitely waterproof!@</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! It&#x27;s not too thick and clumpy and the brush is the perfect size so I don&#x27;t have any trouble applying it. It doesn&#x27;t smudge or run and lasts all day, but washes off easily. I highly recommend this mascara.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mascara for years.  I love it and hope Avon never gets rid of it.  It works great and although it is waterproof it washes off fairly easy.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great product. Everything came on time, great condition, and I have allergies and this mascara does NOT bother my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Washes off with no problem. I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> It was a little dry (seems like may be old).</li>
            <li> Even though the mascara was sealed, it was clumpy and dried out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this eye shadow for over 25 years.  It&#x27;s wonderful.  It is waterproof and doesn&#x27;t run or smear in the wettest conditions.  I&#x27;ve snorkeled with it and it is still perfect.  However, the best part is it washes off easily with no makeup removers.  I use an Olay wet wash cloth, which I have used for years, and it takes all of it off easily.  Please don&#x27;t ever stop making it.  I&#x27;ve tried others and always fall back to this one and always will!</li>
            <li> I have used this products for many years and LOVE it. I can&#x27;t find it on Avon&#x27;s website and I&#x27;m bummed! I&#x27;m a contact wearer and also have allergies and this mascara does not smudge. I use eye makeup remover to get it off.</li>
            <li> I have tried other mascaras but this is still my favorite.  I was very happy to see I could order this from Amazon.  Many other brands irritate my eyes and the Avon Wash-off Waterproof does not.  No smudges or smearing either.</li>
            <li> I have used it for years!&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t clump or fall off in flakes in your eyes&lt;br /&gt;or smear!  The only positive suggestion I have for Avon is to&lt;br /&gt;please bring back the Brown/Black.  As it&#x27;s more complimentary to my&lt;br /&gt;hair and skin coloring.  Beyond that I encourage anyone to give it a try!!</li>
            <li> Came fast and the price was definitely right !!</li>
            <li> These are by far the best mascara I ever bought.  I&#x27;ve had them over 6 months, just now went to the 2nd tube.  Does not smudge, smear, flake and really separate&#x27;s the lashes.  Nice and thick with 2 coats.  From Avon, who knew?!</li>
            <li> Great mascara as it stays on all day &amp; washes off with facial cleanser easily, Highly recommend.</li>
