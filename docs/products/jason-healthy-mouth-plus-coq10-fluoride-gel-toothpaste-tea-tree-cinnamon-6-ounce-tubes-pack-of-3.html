            <li>My husband&#x27;s teeth were getting more yellow as he got older.  </li>
            <li>For whatever reason my teeth have become super sensitive to sweets and sometimes even brushing triggers the sensitivity.</li>

            <li>Jason&#x27;s was literally the only toothpaste that fit the bill.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m in and really like it.</li>
            <li>I really like the cinnemon flavor and this product</li>
            <li>I have white teeth, so it was hard to tell if Jason&#x27;s was really great or not.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for awhile now; good stuff. Low foam, nice flavor, and tea tree is good for the teeth/gums. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I have a ton of problems with my gums and teeth and being diabetic on top of it does not help. I have tried almost everything to help with my whole mouth feeling sore and unclean all the time and this toothpaste, hands down, is the BEST! My gums and teeth are doing the best I have ever seen. Also it is the best tasting toothpaste out there!  My husband loves it also!</li>
            <li> Fresh and clean taste.  Contains FLUORIDE.  Some people seem to think it does not.  This is a great product and leaves you feeling so clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth are brighter and the sensitivity has drastically decrease since using this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Good product, but thought I would receive three tubes.</li>
            <li> For whatever reason my teeth have become super sensitive to sweets and sometimes even brushing triggers the sensitivity. I decided I wanted to find a toothpaste that wasn&#x27;t abrasive and also didn&#x27;t have saccharin - the sweetness bothers my teeth and the taste is awful. At the same time, fluoride was a must. Jason&#x27;s was literally the only toothpaste that fit the bill. I really like this toothpaste. I&#x27;ve only had it for a little over a week, but so far so good. It has a different, though not unpleasant, taste. Not really sure how to describe it, but I think it&#x27;s the tea tree oil. My mouth and teeth feel great afterward and the freshness lasts.</li>
            <li> I have white teeth, so it was hard to tell if Jason&#x27;s was really great or not.  My husband&#x27;s teeth were getting more yellow as he got older.  One day I noticed how white his teeth had gotten.  I could actually see the stains coming off his teeth!  I asked him which of the many toothpastes I had put in the bathroom he used...He said Jasons!  That was good enough for me...Now we keep Jason&#x27;s around and his teeth are nice and white.  Sounds like a commercial, eh?</li>
            <li> Going SLS-free will really help keep cankers sores away. I have been using a different SLS-free brand but since this one was cheaper at the store, I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not crazy about the taste and would NOT say it \\&quot;doesn&#x27;t overload my taste buds.\\&quot; I&#x27;m surprised at how many people love the flavor and consider it \\&quot;mellow,\\&quot; \\&quot;mild,\\&quot; and \\&quot;subtle.\\&quot; NOT!I think it has a very strong flavor, but that&#x27;s not that important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It foams A LOT! I definitely had to cut back on the amount I put on my toothbrush and I normally don&#x27;t use a lot anyway. The foaming makes me wonder what they put in there because usually stuff doesn&#x27;t foam a lot naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot rate its effectiveness as to cavity prevention or whiteness, but it is a good choice to avoid canker sores.</li>
            <li> convinced it prevents periodontal problems</li>
            <li> I like the taste. It reminds me of Beechnut gum. No bad chemicals, etc. and it has good things for your health. I&#x27;m in and really like it.</li>
            <li> So many healthy toothpastes either don&#x27;t foam or taste awful.....I&#x27;ve thrown away several others, including some from Jasons. This one foams right up in my mouth and stays that way throughout the brushing, and the taste is wonderful.  I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of weeks, so I can&#x27;t speak to the whitening power, but that seems just fine, too. I&#x27;ve got it on automated shipping, and the price is even better.</li>
            <li> I had been having problems with sensitivity and my gums had been sore.  I was desperate for something to help and I bought this toothpaste.  After 3 months of using this I have no problems with my gums or with sensitivity (aside from using this I also use a fluoride rinse and floss daily).  Its a great toothpaste that helps fight germs and bacteria and make your gums more healthy.  The flavor is very subtle and nice and I like how it leaves my mouth clean and feeling fresh without feeling all \\&quot;minty\\&quot; or artificial.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great taste for being natural! My favorite natural toothpaste and I&#x27;ve tried a lot!</li>
            <li> I started using this because I did some research on Teatree oil and gums.  I have been using it for about two weeks and have noticed the pockets in my gum are getting smaller,  and my gums are closer to my teeth and look much pinker.  I also gargle with a Teatree mouthwash. this is the only thing that I have added or changed about my dental care.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become accustomed to the strong flavor and like it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it was any better than any other toothpaste, and it didn&#x27;t have a pleasant taste either, not impressed at all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not thrilled about giving this product one star, however I couldn&#x27;t even use it. Why is it that manufacturers of products that are supposed to heal skin or gums have to put aloe in them? I&#x27;m allergic to the stuff, but I only noticed after ordering Jason Healthy Mouth that it contained aloe.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;Love this Toothpaste as much as the Jason Mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;Doesnt have that sickining sugar sweet ,funky taste.&lt;br /&gt;So does my Dentist.</li>
            <li> Nice product, clean feeling.</li>
            <li> This paste leaves your mouth feeling very clean . (with no soapy mintey sugar taste) My dentist recommended it to me,,,,,I see why she and  the smart people use it,  She don,t sell it  She buys it on Amazon herself.</li>
            <li> Just read the ingredients and you&#x27;ll be impressed. You&#x27;ll be even more impressed after brushing with it. My teeth are in great shape, and I&#x27;ve been using this for more than 5 years now. Dentists haven&#x27;t said that my teeth are worse off than people who use fluoride toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I find this tooth paste much to my liking because it is not full of chemicals and does not have a strong peppermint taste. I am of the option that it  has more health  advantages than regular commercial products.</li>
            <li> It leaves a funky taste in my mouth.. however, not funky enought that if stops me from using it. I bought it for the COQ10 benefits..and won&#x27;t know how good that works till my next dental appointment., in 3 months.</li>
            <li> We were recommended this product and it is ok. I really like the cinnemon flavor and this product only comes in the one flavor so I wouldn&#x27;t order it again.</li>
