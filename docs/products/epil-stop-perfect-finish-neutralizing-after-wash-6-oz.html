            <li>Great product, neutralizes the acids quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>Stop Perfect Finish, because I had developed bumps under my chin for a period of time</li>
            <li>Since I found this product I am able to tolerate hair removers much better.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this product, but instead of spending almost $5 on one and having to wait for it to be an add-on, I purchase a pack of four for $10 that I get shipped with Prime.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this wash for a couple of years now, but for some reason can&#x27;t find it in stores any more.</li>
            <li>I really love using Epil Stop</li>
            <li>My skin feels loads better after using it, and I know I don&#x27;t have to worry about what those chemical residues will do to my body.</li>

            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;after wash&amp;#34; did make my legs feel smooth.  </li>
            <li>special person in your life.</li>
            <li>I lathered my legs up with Epil Stop right after removing the hair and there were no adverse reactions!  </li>
            <li>I am super allergic to depilitories so this neutralizing after wash is my answer.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this stuff!!!</li>
            <li>But my local Dollar Tree keeps it in stock most of the time!</li>
            <li>Hair removers are highly alkaline and irritate the skin, but they&#x27;re so quick and easy, and must cheaper than waxing.  </li>
            <li>I love it and it really works for people with very sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>, that you follow the DIRECTIONS with, and then follow it right after you rinse with this.</li>
            <li>times are hard right now, money is tight, gotta look for the best deals :)</li>
            <li>I appreciate a product like this, makes me feel better about using such chemicals as Veet or Nair contains.</li>
            <li>Knowing that it will safely remove the chemical film left behind once you&#x27;ve removed/rinse the hair removal product is great.</li>
            <li>but if you dont have a dollar tree in your area, you can buy it off their web site, you could get a whole case for the price of one of these.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great and makes it so I can use Nair on my bikini area without burning the skin or irritating it.</li>
            <li>Like others said, you can&#x27;t find it in stores much...</li>
            <li>I just wish it was a little better priced and offered package options like a pack of 6 for a reduced cost (per item).</li>
            <li>I also feel better knowing that the harsh chemicals are off my body.</li>
            <li>I usually go and stock up :)</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve used hair removal products in the past and had a good burn, especially if you&#x27;re man-scaping - let&#x27;s just say it - especially if you burned your nuts, this is what you were missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using this for several years and it really keeps you from burning your skin.</li>
            <li>it completely removes all traces from my legs.</li>
            <li>I dont use depilatories very often (only when I am in a bind) but this is a MUST!!!</li>
            <li>I was really nervous about using Neet Gel because the last time my skin burned and turned red.  </li>
            <li>When I use this stuff, it doesn&#x27;t really change color as much as it says it will, so it can be hard to tell if it&#x27;s working if you just judge based on that requirement.</li>
            <li>It really does turn pink when in contact with the hair removing chemicals and then white when there is none.</li>
            <li>It is a clear color in the bottle, but when you apply it to skin that has traces of hair remover, it reacts with the hair remover to turn pink.    </li>

            <li> Okay, that&#x27;s a little dramatic</li>
            <li> But I have very sensitive skin and very stubborn hair, so I have to leave it on a little extra, and that is not good.</li>
            <li> It was recommended by a saleswoman in one of those little privately owned drugstores that aren&#x27;t around anymore, and is a bit hard to find, but worth the effort.  </li>
            <li> As said it turns pink to let you know when the prior product is still there.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and usually got bumps and redness from using hair removers.</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars, because I felt it was a little thin and much of it ended up down the drain, before I could &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; with it.</li>
            <li> I did experience some irritation, but a lot less than without using this product.</li>
            <li> I used to have ugly bumps and red skin the first day after using a hair remover, but no more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really weird, with all the pink bubbles-</li>
            <li> The harshchemicals really do smell awful, but this helps take some of it down the drain.</li>
            <li> Chemical hair removers always leave behind that kind-of tingling residue, you know the feeling I&#x27;m talking about.</li>
            <li> I always got a rash and painful ingrown hairs from both shaving and chemical hair remover.</li>
            <li> It cleans my skin and dissolves all nasty residue from your skin from any Hair remover product...</li>
            <li> but its insulting.</li>

            <li> This product is a life saver! Okay, that&#x27;s a little dramatic but still!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells great, works great, can&#x27;t beat the price. I&#x27;m just upset I didn&#x27;t know about it sooner. Even kills that gross hair remover scent. Can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> This product works great.  I have been using this for several years and it really keeps you from burning your skin.</li>
            <li> I was really nervous about using Neet Gel because the last time my skin burned and turned red.  I lathered my legs up with Epil Stop right after removing the hair and there were no adverse reactions!  It really does turn pink when in contact with the hair removing chemicals and then white when there is none.</li>
            <li> I always got a rash and painful ingrown hairs from both shaving and chemical hair remover. I bought this and it is the best. it completely removes all traces from my legs. i love how it changes color than rinses clean when all traces are gone!</li>
            <li> I love it and it really works for people with very sensitive skin! Just wish it was back in stock.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and usually got bumps and redness from using hair removers. Well not anymore. This product is awesome and I highly recommend it. I just wish it was a little better priced and offered package options like a pack of 6 for a reduced cost (per item). Great, great product.</li>
            <li> I like Epil Stop Perfect Finish, because I had developed bumps under my chin for a period of time, I needed to try something different and Epil Stop Perfect Finish seems to work now in preventing bumps and skin burns from shaving and hair removal creams . I would like to find a product that would delay hair growing back 1/2 as often. But until I find a safe product, I will recommend Epil Stop Perfect Finish because it does seem to neutralize hair removal product chemicals.</li>
            <li> Without this product, hair removers burn my skin no matter how carefully I rinse off afterwards.    Hair removers are highly alkaline and irritate the skin, but they&#x27;re so quick and easy, and must cheaper than waxing.  This after wash works with any brand of hair remover.  It is a clear color in the bottle, but when you apply it to skin that has traces of hair remover, it reacts with the hair remover to turn pink.    Since I found this product I am able to tolerate hair removers much better.  I used to have ugly bumps and red skin the first day after using a hair remover, but no more.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I am super allergic to depilitories so this neutralizing after wash is my answer. I dont use depilatories very often (only when I am in a bind) but this is a MUST!!!</li>
            <li> i just started using veet, i used it twice and got rashes each time, so i went to the dollar store here in my town. and bought this product, for $1. it works great, i recommend it. i stocked up. but if you dont have a dollar tree in your area, you can buy it off their web site, you could get a whole case for the price of one of these. times are hard right now, money is tight, gotta look for the best deals :)</li>
            <li> Skin irritation after hair removal has always been a problem for me; redness, burning, etc.  Only wish I had found this product earlier.  It was recommended by a saleswoman in one of those little privately owned drugstores that aren&#x27;t around anymore, and is a bit hard to find, but worth the effort.  I can use Nair, use this product, and then go out without waiting three hours for the rash to go away.  Also kills any lingering chemical odor.</li>
            <li> Came across this stuff at Rite Aid year(s) ago.  I absolutely LOVE it!!!  I&#x27;ve always had problems when using creams, and this stuff has put an end to that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Highly recommend this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve used hair removal products in the past and had a good burn, especially if you&#x27;re man-scaping - let&#x27;s just say it - especially if you burned your nuts, this is what you were missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put the stuff on you like to use, hopefully something i know works, that you follow the DIRECTIONS with, and then follow it right after you rinse with this. Boom. Neutralizes the nut-burning nastiness of the remover. No burn, no hot pink nuts, just smoove goodness for that... special person in your life. Unless... you&#x27;re denuding your nuts for your own pleasure... then... nice nuts for you. Enjoy.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product and find that it reduces irritation and itching.</li>
            <li> I appreciate a product like this, makes me feel better about using such chemicals as Veet or Nair contains. Knowing that it will safely remove the chemical film left behind once you&#x27;ve removed/rinse the hair removal product is great.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;after wash&amp;#34; did make my legs feel smooth.  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars, because I felt it was a little thin and much of it ended up down the drain, before I could &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; with it.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but instead of spending almost $5 on one and having to wait for it to be an add-on, I purchase a pack of four for $10 that I get shipped with Prime.  [[ASIN:B008N0QE8G Epil Stop Perfect Finish Neutralizing After Wash,6 Oz (Pack of 4)]]</li>
            <li> I adore veet- it doesn&#x27;t set me on fire like Nair does. But I have very sensitive skin and very stubborn hair, so I have to leave it on a little extra, and that is not good. But with this- my skin isn&#x27;t irritated at all. You get a lot of value from one bottle. It&#x27;s really weird, with all the pink bubbles- but I know it&#x27;s working.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I can veet and go swimming or veet and shave without any extra pain or difficulties. This is just the perfect cure for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this wash for a couple of years now, but for some reason can&#x27;t find it in stores any more. If you think you can&#x27;t tolerate depilitory creams, try using this afterwards. It totally prevents skin irritation and it&#x27;s like night and day. I will never be without this product!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t  do anything for me !</li>
            <li> This stuff works great and makes it so I can use Nair on my bikini area without burning the skin or irritating it. Like others said, you can&#x27;t find it in stores much... But my local Dollar Tree keeps it in stock most of the time! Full sized bottles! I usually go and stock up :)</li>
            <li> A must have if you are using chemical facial hair removers.</li>
            <li> I really love using Epil Stop Finish Neutralizing After wash... It cleans my skin and dissolves all nasty residue from your skin from any Hair remover product...</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the reviews. I have only used it twice, but it does seem to help. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great product, neutralizes the acids quickly and efficiently. I use hair removal cream semi often and I dont get burns when I follow up with this product. The harshchemicals really do smell awful, but this helps take some of it down the drain. My only concern is the cost! Ive purchased these things at DOLLAR TREE before! Why they knocked up the price 1300%, I dont know.. but its insulting.</li>
            <li> When I use this stuff, it doesn&#x27;t really change color as much as it says it will, so it can be hard to tell if it&#x27;s working if you just judge based on that requirement. I could tell if it was working based on how my skin felt. Chemical hair removers always leave behind that kind-of tingling residue, you know the feeling I&#x27;m talking about. Lather this around until that feeling goes away.&lt;br /&gt;The product does do its job well though. My skin feels loads better after using it, and I know I don&#x27;t have to worry about what those chemical residues will do to my body.</li>
            <li> my skin feels much better when I use it.  I also feel better knowing that the harsh chemicals are off my body.</li>
            <li> I will never be without this stuff again!  It affords a great way to make sure all the depilatory is off the skin.</li>
            <li> I used Veet and then this to cleanse afterwards. As said it turns pink to let you know when the prior product is still there. It is convenient and it smells great.</li>
            <li> This is great for removing the chemical residues that often times a hair removal cream leaves on your skin. If you want to make sure you got it all off after rinsing, this is a no fault way of doing so. I did experience some irritation, but a lot less than without using this product.</li>
