            <li>You&#x27;ll love it!!</li>
            <li>Love this!!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!!  </li>
            <li>My eyebrows look amazing!</li>
            <li>but basically the less-is-more approach seems to work the best for most people.</li>
            <li>Love this product and it is so beautiful!</li>
            <li>All in all it really is a great value, great bye, great product:)</li>
            <li>It goes on easily, stays on all day, and is the perfect shade for me.</li>
            <li>If you want perfect bold brows this is the product for you!</li>
            <li>The color is good.</li>
            <li>the NYX Eyebrow Gel is a good dupe for this product.</li>
            <li>I LOVED this product and I have darker rather than lighter brows.  </li>
            <li>Bought NYX&#x27;s as well since it came out 3 days after buying this, and NYX is almost as good, but this will not budge until your taking it off</li>
            <li>I feel like if your brows look good, the rest of your makeup doesn&#x27;t have to, so</li>
            <li>It blends well, and the color is good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply, stays on all day and makes my brows look great.</li>
            <li>Once you find the best technique for your unique, desired brow shape, you&#x27;ll  fall in love with this product.</li>
            <li>Perfect for brows, I love love love it.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Amazing product</li>
            <li>All I can say is that this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>and it matches nicely.  </li>
            <li>It is a neutral taupe shade that is much cooler toned than it looks in the photo and works perfectly with my skintone and hair color.</li>
            <li>I have an issue with brow color turning warm on me.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and it stays true even on my oily skin.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite new makeup &amp;#34;trick&amp;#34; as the results are excellent.</li>
            <li>The blonde color is perfect for me, and the formula is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Ive been using this for a week or two, and its pretty great stay-wise.</li>
            <li>if you have very light brows try the brow wiz</li>
            <li>I am a redhead with very light brows and lashes.  </li>
            <li>It is very light, so</li>
            <li>Best stuff you can use, applies smoothly and looks natural!</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>I love the way this product looks when applied.</li>
            <li>:) There is nothing else like this product.</li>
            <li>I have been using this now for about 10 months, and my brows have never looked better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a blonde and this color matches perfect!!</li>
            <li>I can get much better results with an eyebrow  pencil.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;d honestly be better off with an eyebrow pencil and some shadow to set it.</li>
            <li>I really love this dipbrow.</li>
            <li>LOVE love love.</li>
            <li>The pomade is fabulous!</li>
            <li>The darker shade helps define my eyes better.  </li>
            <li>I still love this product, I just use a darker shade.  </li>
            <li>I also love that it is water proof.</li>
            <li>I do need to reapply it 1-2 more times throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Plus, it blends a lot better than brow pencil.  </li>
            <li>My brows have never looked better.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Im better off using IT cosmetics brow spooly and pencil combo and saving 10 min.</li>
            <li>Love love love this product .</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I came back and bought the &amp;#34;Blonde&amp;#34; for every day wear, and I&#x27;m very happy.  </li>
            <li>I like this more than a pencil as it can also cover the gray.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I love the heck out of anything Anastasia makes.</li>
            <li>It wears all day, doesn&#x27;t smudge, and is the perfect color blonde I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Pick up more product as needed and apply.  </li>
            <li>Apply them wherever your own brows are sparse or too light to be seen</li>
            <li>This is my favorite makeup product.</li>
            <li>looks much better than taupe.</li>
            <li>This is a makeup bag must, just make sure you have an angled brush.</li>
            <li>Phenomenal product.</li>
            <li>This product is fabulous!</li>
            <li>Definitely not the best .</li>
            <li>I really do love this product.</li>
            <li>This is WAY better than powder</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Goes on very smooth and easy to use.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s way to becoming gray, but this looks better than anything else I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Dip brow is a nice cool color for lighter brows.</li>
            <li>Before trying Anastasia&#x27;s dipbrow, I used brow pencils most of the time because I found them to be more precise.</li>
            <li>looks great and very natural.</li>
            <li>Filling in the brows is one of the most important makeup steps, I believe for all ladies.  </li>
            <li>I am a professional Makeup artist and I love this!!</li>
            <li>This product lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t smudge easily.  </li>
            <li>This goes on easily and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to apply with an angled brush.</li>
            <li>and this is easily achieved by using a lighter hand and blending a bit with a mascara wand or spoolie.  </li>
            <li>Goes on easily and stays on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and I soften and blend them with the spoolie end of the brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hands down the best product for eyebrows !</li>
            <li>It lasts all day and goes on so easy and smooth.</li>
            <li>as long as you have the right brush this brow product is great!</li>
            <li>This  Dipbrow Pomade is perfect for those who have little hair like myself.</li>
            <li>I basically don&#x27;t have natural brows and this Pomade makes me look like I have perfect natural brows.</li>
            <li>Upon reflection, I&#x27;ve decided that \\&quot;blond\\&quot; is too light for me, so I will relegate it to the makeup drawer, where the things I don&#x27;t use go to die.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic pomade.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous.</li>
            <li>It really is fabulous.</li>
            <li>is light</li>
            <li>make sure you keep the top on, it dries out really fast.</li>
            <li>I use it with a stiff angle brush (specifically a MAC #266) and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>- I can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love it!!</li>
            <li>If you are a first timer, apply lightly- you can always build up more coverage as you go.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super creamy and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I have dark red/auburn colored hair and very fair</li>
            <li>I am fair and blonde so the blonde color was a great match.</li>
            <li>so it lasts and worth the money 100%!</li>
            <li>and I live in a warm humid climate.</li>
            <li>It worked okay with my old brow brush but worked 100% better once I got the Ardell brush.</li>
            <li>This is the best makeup to get natural looking brows, true to color for my blonde hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use with an angled brush spooly thing---but the blond is more like an ashy gray...better than red for sure, but darker than I thought.</li>
            <li>The blond shade is a very light taupe without any red or gray, perfect for light or dark blond hair.  </li>
            <li>It also looks good on my daughter who has red hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice, natural color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve told friends to try this product and they love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>Application is pretty easy too.</li>
            <li>Not quite blonde enough to me, but the best color I have found.</li>
            <li>This stuff, sed with the Brush - Duo A/S - Mini (#7), gives me a thicker, natural looking brow with a great shape and natural color.</li>
            <li>If you need a quick way to enhance your brows and go, then this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li>The blonde is a perfect color, about the same as &amp;#34;fling&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Also, shipping was quick, as promised.</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t jumped on the Dipbrow bandwagon yet, I highly recommend that you give it a try!!!  </li>
            <li>The blond color is a soft very light brown.  </li>
            <li>I prefer a more natural look with my eyebrows as opposed to the super defined &amp;#34;powerbrow&amp;#34; that is so in right now</li>
            <li>This is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>this gives you more control and looks natural.</li>
            <li>Overall, happy so far</li>
            <li>The blonde is a nice neutral color too.</li>
            <li>The pencils had better color, but I could never get them to look as natural as the powder.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>so so worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>, just can&#x27;t think of it right now).</li>
            <li>For right now, I like the darker look.</li>
            <li>I use this product in combo with Ardell brow powder, and that seems to be the right look and color for me.</li>
            <li>If you have nice full eyebrows (lucky you) you will need even less product.</li>
            <li>I purchased a small angled brush and it works great.</li>
            <li>so most of my eyebrows are barely noticeable.)  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s essential that you have a very fine angled brush.  </li>
            <li>I am very fair with dark blonde hair, strong cool undertones, and sparse, blond (clear, really) eyebrows that are invisible without makeup.</li>
            <li>This makes a great base and draws a great tail, so it is a lot easier to do my brows with this product going on first.</li>
            <li>I ordered the blonde color because I have very light brown hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am a natural light brunette with blond all-over highlights.</li>
            <li>I actually prefer this to the make forever waterproof brow gel in terms of longwear-ness (there&#x27;s probably a better term for that</li>
            <li>This  is the most hideous makeup purchase I&#x27;ve ever made in my entire life.</li>
            <li>Stays on with oily skin and that woman-of-a-certain-age glow (is it hot in here or is it me?</li>
            <li>First of all, the color.</li>
            <li>I was looking for that one Holy Grail product that would give me  consistent color and wearability.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
            <li>Very durable, stays on all day without a touch up!  </li>
            <li>Just received and used it for the first time this morning.</li>
            <li>reference, I have light brown hair with gold highlights and very ashy light brown brows and the blonde</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much!</li>
            <li>With dipbrow, so long as you have a fine-tip/slanted brush &amp; spoolie, this product can actually even more precise than a pencil!</li>
            <li>I love how you can do a stronger or softer brow with the same product just depending on how much you blend.</li>
            <li>The Pros for this product are,  the color which is what i would call a &#x27;true taupe&#x27;,(grayish tan), the smooth consistency of the formula and the value because a littel goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t very cheap, but it will probably dry out before it runs out.  </li>
            <li>first time I tried it I applied too much.</li>
            <li>Fairly waterproof (does tend to fade a little with sweat), but much better than any other pencil, pen or powder I&#x27;ve tried for the brows.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy and easy to use once you get used to it - especially if you use the spooly side of the Anastasia Brush Duo (#12) to help brush it in!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m sure this will last me one year, a little goes a long way, very nice</li>
            <li>it looks much warmer in the picture...</li>
            <li>Great for thin brows.</li>
            <li>Blonde looks light gray on my brows</li>
            <li>Get it while you can, I think it&#x27;s going to be sold out all the time once the word really gets out there.</li>
            <li>I also like that you can make it look lighter or darker depending on how much you use.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I missed a spot with my makeup remover last night and looked up to see that a chunk of one of my eyebrows was still filled in even after a 15 minute</li>
            <li>and I really like to sleep in, so for me to take time to do it in the morning</li>
            <li>I really like how it tames brows while darkening them</li>
            <li>but I dont think it works very well.</li>
            <li>It does match my hair color really well.</li>
            <li>Defining my eyebrows really brings out my eyes</li>
            <li>I use other Anastasia brands and love their product line.</li>
            <li>Highly pigmented so you don&#x27;t need much</li>
            <li>I have faint blond brows, and this is the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever found for them as far as staying power and looking natural.</li>
            <li>My biggest gripe with eyebrow products is that they are usually too warm toned or they can&#x27;t cut it against my oiliness.</li>
            <li>Okay for wearing at night, but too dark for day-wear.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you clean your brush daily or it will be more difficult to apply.</li>
            <li>Product stays on great but a little too dark for my light blonde hair...</li>
            <li>The consistency is creamy and you can control the darkness by applying more or less product.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll change my mind again as I get older.  </li>
            <li>and I found it here on Amazon at a decent price with shipping since I have</li>
            <li>older women w/white eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend it, especially for blondes or light brunettes!</li>
            <li>The blond was definitely the right choice -- it&#x27;s a very pigmented product, so if you&#x27;re choosing between two shades, go for the lighter one.</li>
            <li>There are several videos on youtube that really help you find the right way to apply the product</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li>I ordered the blonde, which was perfect for my dirty blonde hair--not too light, as I had worried.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other eyebrow products but the color wasn&#x27;t as natural and had to retouch often.</li>
            <li>Although this product took a few tries a to master, it looks amazing!</li>
            <li>Darker than I thought it would be but matches really well with my natural color.</li>
            <li>The color is too cool for me, too grey...  </li>
            <li>I am a natural blonde (but have colored my hair lighter blonde) and my eyebrows are practically nonexistent; they&#x27;re very, very light blonde and also sparse from plucking too much in the 90s</li>
            <li>AND I live in Texas heat.</li>
            <li>and it still looks brand new.</li>
            <li>I am using it with a Sigma brush and they look very natural.</li>
            <li>But, this product makes my eyebrows look very natural.</li>
            <li>It stays on ALL day, and it looks very natural.</li>
            <li>Leaves a very natural appearance, and stays until you take it off.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been filling/shaping my brows in for the past 7 years, alwas looking for the next best thing, but always using a pencil - usually Mac in fling.</li>
            <li>But I wanted a more sculpted, thicker look (and something that didn&#x27;t run out every few weeks!)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really hard to find a good blonde for really bleach blonde haird girls.</li>
            <li>It applies easily and smoothly, no smudging or melting from oily skin.</li>
            <li>, it would be a full star product but the blonde isn&#x27;t actually blonde.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a very light natural blond color so it can be difficult to find the right brow shade.</li>
            <li>I have somewhat sparse eyebrows, and this product fills them in naturally.</li>
            <li>but so far this looks like a keeper.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now using \\&quot;soft brown\\&quot; instead.  </li>
            <li>The product is very creamy and it will last forever.</li>
            <li>Completely waterproof and sweatproof.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s become a key piece of my getting ready routine</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>I was also worried that it wouldn&#x27;t look as natural as the Brow Wiz, but after three days I had it figured out.</li>
            <li>this looks natural and stays on until you wash it off.  </li>
            <li>it looks so natural.</li>
            <li>I usually use the powder from the drugstore, but it would wipe easily if I forget I have it on.</li>
            <li>I use the blonde Dipbrow Pomade using an eyeliner brush followed with the Bdellium Tools Professional Makeup Brush Pink Bambu Series - Lash 733 to achieve a full, natural brow.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure to screw the cap back on very tightly to prevent it from drying out.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I thought I was being innovative to think it could be used as eye liner as well (a subtle one).  </li>
            <li>I have dark golden (strawberry?)</li>
            <li>I was expecting the product to be light since I got the one in blonde, but it was very dark.</li>
            <li>I have pretty dark brown hair naturally</li>
            <li>But make sure ur brows are clean with no oil or other brow color before using, otherwise this product will turn very dark!!!!</li>
            <li>Make sure you use the right brush, small, stiff and slanted, to apply a tiny amount.</li>
            <li>Lasts pretty long too, as long as I don&#x27;t scratch my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Much darker than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>It was much lighter than I expected.</li>
            <li>Just barely touch the pomade and start filling in at the center of your brows working your way back towards the tail first and then with what is remaining on the brush move toward the front of your brows.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m a natural blonde</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for a month already and have barely made a dent in it.</li>
            <li>I love eye brow game</li>
            <li>The color is near what my now solid white eyebrows USE to be in color.  </li>
            <li>It does not dry up in the pot.</li>
            <li>I usually use a cover girl pencil, but I use it up so quickly that I decided to find something longer lasting.</li>
            <li>I have to use it VERY sparingly so my brows aren&#x27;t freakishly dark.</li>
            <li>You just barely tap your brush into this, and it will do the entire brow.  </li>
            <li>so I started bleaching my eyebrows to make them a little bit lighter, since I don&#x27;t like light hair and dark eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Still a little dark for me but with a light hand</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much, just use a little.</li>
            <li>Also the little pot lasts so much longer than an eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li>The color is slightly Ashy, not too dark, and not as bold or severe as the Taupe dip brow.</li>
            <li>Make sure to keep the lid as tight as possible to prevent it from drying out which is common for products in this type of container.</li>

            <li> Love this!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!  </li>
            <li> My eyebrows look amazing!</li>
            <li> but basically the less-is-more approach seems to work the best for most people.</li>
            <li> Love this product and it is so beautiful!</li>
            <li> All in all it really is a great value, great bye, great product:)</li>
            <li> It goes on easily, stays on all day, and is the perfect shade for me.</li>
            <li> If you want perfect bold brows this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> The color is good.</li>
            <li> the NYX Eyebrow Gel is a good dupe for this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVED this product and I have darker rather than lighter brows.  </li>
            <li> Bought NYX&#x27;s as well since it came out 3 days after buying this, and NYX is almost as good, but this will not budge until your taking it off</li>
            <li> I feel like if your brows look good, the rest of your makeup doesn&#x27;t have to, so</li>
            <li> It blends well, and the color is good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to apply, stays on all day and makes my brows look great.</li>
            <li> Once you find the best technique for your unique, desired brow shape, you&#x27;ll  fall in love with this product.</li>
            <li> Perfect for brows, I love love love it.  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Amazing product</li>
            <li> All I can say is that this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> and it matches nicely.  </li>
            <li> It is a neutral taupe shade that is much cooler toned than it looks in the photo and works perfectly with my skintone and hair color.</li>
            <li> I have an issue with brow color turning warm on me.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and it stays true even on my oily skin.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite new makeup &amp;#34;trick&amp;#34; as the results are excellent.</li>
            <li> The blonde color is perfect for me, and the formula is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for a week or two, and its pretty great stay-wise.</li>
            <li> if you have very light brows try the brow wiz</li>
            <li> I am a redhead with very light brows and lashes.  </li>
            <li> It is very light, so</li>
            <li> Best stuff you can use, applies smoothly and looks natural!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> I love the way this product looks when applied.</li>
            <li> :) There is nothing else like this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this now for about 10 months, and my brows have never looked better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a blonde and this color matches perfect!!</li>
            <li> I can get much better results with an eyebrow  pencil.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;d honestly be better off with an eyebrow pencil and some shadow to set it.</li>
            <li> I really love this dipbrow.</li>
            <li> LOVE love love.</li>
            <li> The pomade is fabulous!</li>
            <li> The darker shade helps define my eyes better.  </li>
            <li> I still love this product, I just use a darker shade.  </li>
            <li> I also love that it is water proof.</li>
            <li> I do need to reapply it 1-2 more times throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Plus, it blends a lot better than brow pencil.  </li>
            <li> My brows have never looked better.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Im better off using IT cosmetics brow spooly and pencil combo and saving 10 min.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product .</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I came back and bought the &amp;#34;Blonde&amp;#34; for every day wear, and I&#x27;m very happy.  </li>
            <li> I like this more than a pencil as it can also cover the gray.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> I love the heck out of anything Anastasia makes.</li>
            <li> It wears all day, doesn&#x27;t smudge, and is the perfect color blonde I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Pick up more product as needed and apply.  </li>
            <li> Apply them wherever your own brows are sparse or too light to be seen</li>
            <li> This is my favorite makeup product.</li>
            <li> looks much better than taupe.</li>
            <li> This is a makeup bag must, just make sure you have an angled brush.</li>
            <li> Phenomenal product.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous!</li>
            <li> Definitely not the best .</li>
            <li> I really do love this product.</li>
            <li> This is WAY better than powder</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> Goes on very smooth and easy to use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s way to becoming gray, but this looks better than anything else I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Dip brow is a nice cool color for lighter brows.</li>
            <li> Before trying Anastasia&#x27;s dipbrow, I used brow pencils most of the time because I found them to be more precise.</li>
            <li> looks great and very natural.</li>
            <li> Filling in the brows is one of the most important makeup steps, I believe for all ladies.  </li>
            <li> I am a professional Makeup artist and I love this!!</li>
            <li> This product lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t smudge easily.  </li>
            <li> This goes on easily and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is easy to apply with an angled brush.</li>
            <li> and this is easily achieved by using a lighter hand and blending a bit with a mascara wand or spoolie.  </li>
            <li> Goes on easily and stays on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and I soften and blend them with the spoolie end of the brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hands down the best product for eyebrows !</li>
            <li> It lasts all day and goes on so easy and smooth.</li>
            <li> as long as you have the right brush this brow product is great!</li>
            <li> This  Dipbrow Pomade is perfect for those who have little hair like myself.</li>
            <li> I basically don&#x27;t have natural brows and this Pomade makes me look like I have perfect natural brows.</li>
            <li> Upon reflection, I&#x27;ve decided that \\&quot;blond\\&quot; is too light for me, so I will relegate it to the makeup drawer, where the things I don&#x27;t use go to die.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic pomade.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> Fabulous.</li>
            <li> It really is fabulous.</li>
            <li> is light</li>
            <li> make sure you keep the top on, it dries out really fast.</li>
            <li> I use it with a stiff angle brush (specifically a MAC #266) and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> - I can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love it!!</li>
            <li> If you are a first timer, apply lightly- you can always build up more coverage as you go.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super creamy and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I have dark red/auburn colored hair and very fair</li>
            <li> I am fair and blonde so the blonde color was a great match.</li>
            <li> so it lasts and worth the money 100%!</li>
            <li> and I live in a warm humid climate.</li>
            <li> It worked okay with my old brow brush but worked 100% better once I got the Ardell brush.</li>
            <li> This is the best makeup to get natural looking brows, true to color for my blonde hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use with an angled brush spooly thing---but the blond is more like an ashy gray...better than red for sure, but darker than I thought.</li>
            <li> The blond shade is a very light taupe without any red or gray, perfect for light or dark blond hair.  </li>
            <li> It also looks good on my daughter who has red hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice, natural color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve told friends to try this product and they love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> Application is pretty easy too.</li>
            <li> Not quite blonde enough to me, but the best color I have found.</li>
            <li> This stuff, sed with the Brush - Duo A/S - Mini (#7), gives me a thicker, natural looking brow with a great shape and natural color.</li>
            <li> If you need a quick way to enhance your brows and go, then this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> The blonde is a perfect color, about the same as &amp;#34;fling&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Also, shipping was quick, as promised.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t jumped on the Dipbrow bandwagon yet, I highly recommend that you give it a try!!!  </li>
            <li> The blond color is a soft very light brown.  </li>
            <li> I prefer a more natural look with my eyebrows as opposed to the super defined &amp;#34;powerbrow&amp;#34; that is so in right now</li>
            <li> This is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> this gives you more control and looks natural.</li>
            <li> Overall, happy so far</li>
            <li> The blonde is a nice neutral color too.</li>
            <li> The pencils had better color, but I could never get them to look as natural as the powder.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> so so worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> , just can&#x27;t think of it right now).</li>
            <li> For right now, I like the darker look.</li>
            <li> I use this product in combo with Ardell brow powder, and that seems to be the right look and color for me.</li>
            <li> If you have nice full eyebrows (lucky you) you will need even less product.</li>
            <li> I purchased a small angled brush and it works great.</li>
            <li> so most of my eyebrows are barely noticeable.)  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s essential that you have a very fine angled brush.  </li>
            <li> I am very fair with dark blonde hair, strong cool undertones, and sparse, blond (clear, really) eyebrows that are invisible without makeup.</li>
            <li> This makes a great base and draws a great tail, so it is a lot easier to do my brows with this product going on first.</li>
            <li> I ordered the blonde color because I have very light brown hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am a natural light brunette with blond all-over highlights.</li>
            <li> I actually prefer this to the make forever waterproof brow gel in terms of longwear-ness (there&#x27;s probably a better term for that</li>
            <li> This  is the most hideous makeup purchase I&#x27;ve ever made in my entire life.</li>
            <li> Stays on with oily skin and that woman-of-a-certain-age glow (is it hot in here or is it me?</li>
            <li> First of all, the color.</li>
            <li> I was looking for that one Holy Grail product that would give me  consistent color and wearability.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
            <li> Very durable, stays on all day without a touch up!  </li>
            <li> Just received and used it for the first time this morning.</li>
            <li> reference, I have light brown hair with gold highlights and very ashy light brown brows and the blonde</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much!</li>
            <li> With dipbrow, so long as you have a fine-tip/slanted brush &amp; spoolie, this product can actually even more precise than a pencil!</li>
            <li> I love how you can do a stronger or softer brow with the same product just depending on how much you blend.</li>
            <li> The Pros for this product are,  the color which is what i would call a &#x27;true taupe&#x27;,(grayish tan), the smooth consistency of the formula and the value because a littel goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t very cheap, but it will probably dry out before it runs out.  </li>
            <li> first time I tried it I applied too much.</li>
            <li> Fairly waterproof (does tend to fade a little with sweat), but much better than any other pencil, pen or powder I&#x27;ve tried for the brows.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamy and easy to use once you get used to it - especially if you use the spooly side of the Anastasia Brush Duo (#12) to help brush it in!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sure this will last me one year, a little goes a long way, very nice</li>
            <li> it looks much warmer in the picture...</li>
            <li> Great for thin brows.</li>
            <li> Blonde looks light gray on my brows</li>
            <li> Get it while you can, I think it&#x27;s going to be sold out all the time once the word really gets out there.</li>
            <li> I also like that you can make it look lighter or darker depending on how much you use.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I missed a spot with my makeup remover last night and looked up to see that a chunk of one of my eyebrows was still filled in even after a 15 minute</li>
            <li> and I really like to sleep in, so for me to take time to do it in the morning</li>
            <li> I really like how it tames brows while darkening them</li>
            <li> but I dont think it works very well.</li>
            <li> It does match my hair color really well.</li>
            <li> Defining my eyebrows really brings out my eyes</li>
            <li> I use other Anastasia brands and love their product line.</li>
            <li> Highly pigmented so you don&#x27;t need much</li>
            <li> I have faint blond brows, and this is the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever found for them as far as staying power and looking natural.</li>
            <li> My biggest gripe with eyebrow products is that they are usually too warm toned or they can&#x27;t cut it against my oiliness.</li>
            <li> Okay for wearing at night, but too dark for day-wear.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you clean your brush daily or it will be more difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> Product stays on great but a little too dark for my light blonde hair...</li>
            <li> The consistency is creamy and you can control the darkness by applying more or less product.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll change my mind again as I get older.  </li>
            <li> and I found it here on Amazon at a decent price with shipping since I have</li>
            <li> older women w/white eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend it, especially for blondes or light brunettes!</li>
            <li> The blond was definitely the right choice -- it&#x27;s a very pigmented product, so if you&#x27;re choosing between two shades, go for the lighter one.</li>
            <li> There are several videos on youtube that really help you find the right way to apply the product</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li> I ordered the blonde, which was perfect for my dirty blonde hair--not too light, as I had worried.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other eyebrow products but the color wasn&#x27;t as natural and had to retouch often.</li>
            <li> Although this product took a few tries a to master, it looks amazing!</li>
            <li> Darker than I thought it would be but matches really well with my natural color.</li>
            <li> The color is too cool for me, too grey...  </li>
            <li> I am a natural blonde (but have colored my hair lighter blonde) and my eyebrows are practically nonexistent; they&#x27;re very, very light blonde and also sparse from plucking too much in the 90s</li>
            <li> AND I live in Texas heat.</li>
            <li> and it still looks brand new.</li>
            <li> I am using it with a Sigma brush and they look very natural.</li>
            <li> But, this product makes my eyebrows look very natural.</li>
            <li> It stays on ALL day, and it looks very natural.</li>
            <li> Leaves a very natural appearance, and stays until you take it off.  </li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been filling/shaping my brows in for the past 7 years, alwas looking for the next best thing, but always using a pencil - usually Mac in fling.</li>
            <li> But I wanted a more sculpted, thicker look (and something that didn&#x27;t run out every few weeks!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to find a good blonde for really bleach blonde haird girls.</li>
            <li> It applies easily and smoothly, no smudging or melting from oily skin.</li>
            <li> , it would be a full star product but the blonde isn&#x27;t actually blonde.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a very light natural blond color so it can be difficult to find the right brow shade.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sparse eyebrows, and this product fills them in naturally.</li>
            <li> but so far this looks like a keeper.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now using \\&quot;soft brown\\&quot; instead.  </li>
            <li> The product is very creamy and it will last forever.</li>
            <li> Completely waterproof and sweatproof.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s become a key piece of my getting ready routine</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> I was also worried that it wouldn&#x27;t look as natural as the Brow Wiz, but after three days I had it figured out.</li>
            <li> this looks natural and stays on until you wash it off.  </li>
            <li> it looks so natural.</li>
            <li> I usually use the powder from the drugstore, but it would wipe easily if I forget I have it on.</li>
            <li> I use the blonde Dipbrow Pomade using an eyeliner brush followed with the Bdellium Tools Professional Makeup Brush Pink Bambu Series - Lash 733 to achieve a full, natural brow.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure to screw the cap back on very tightly to prevent it from drying out.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I thought I was being innovative to think it could be used as eye liner as well (a subtle one).  </li>
            <li> I have dark golden (strawberry?)</li>
            <li> I was expecting the product to be light since I got the one in blonde, but it was very dark.</li>
            <li> I have pretty dark brown hair naturally</li>
            <li> But make sure ur brows are clean with no oil or other brow color before using, otherwise this product will turn very dark!!!!</li>
            <li> Make sure you use the right brush, small, stiff and slanted, to apply a tiny amount.</li>
            <li> Lasts pretty long too, as long as I don&#x27;t scratch my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Much darker than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> It was much lighter than I expected.</li>
            <li> Just barely touch the pomade and start filling in at the center of your brows working your way back towards the tail first and then with what is remaining on the brush move toward the front of your brows.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m a natural blonde</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a month already and have barely made a dent in it.</li>
            <li> I love eye brow game</li>
            <li> The color is near what my now solid white eyebrows USE to be in color.  </li>
            <li> It does not dry up in the pot.</li>
            <li> I usually use a cover girl pencil, but I use it up so quickly that I decided to find something longer lasting.</li>
            <li> I have to use it VERY sparingly so my brows aren&#x27;t freakishly dark.</li>
            <li> You just barely tap your brush into this, and it will do the entire brow.  </li>
            <li> so I started bleaching my eyebrows to make them a little bit lighter, since I don&#x27;t like light hair and dark eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Still a little dark for me but with a light hand</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take much, just use a little.</li>
            <li> Also the little pot lasts so much longer than an eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li> The color is slightly Ashy, not too dark, and not as bold or severe as the Taupe dip brow.</li>
            <li> Make sure to keep the lid as tight as possible to prevent it from drying out which is common for products in this type of container.</li>
            <li> A tiny, tiny amount goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what the whole hype is all about.</li>
            <li> This will definitely be a product I will keep in my make up bag as long as they are making it!</li>
            <li> so will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> The blonde shade has worked while I had bleach blonde hair and now with my dark blonde hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It should last a long, long time because just a dab is plenty!</li>
            <li> Once I have used my Dipbrow Pomade, I simply powder over my brows with my CoverGirl loose powder and brush upward once through with the blending tip of the Ardell Duo Brush I bought with it.</li>
            <li> I  think it will last a long time as long as it doesn&#x27;t dry out.  </li>
            <li> My eyebrows looked gray YES GRAY when I complete waste of money on my brows.</li>
            <li> says a lot for the product, although it doesn&#x27;t take long at all to apply.  </li>
            <li> lasts so long and doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li> I just blend it with my Etude House eye fix pencils, which are both really grey.</li>
            <li> and I have no idea how I managed so long without it.</li>
            <li> There is plenty of product, enough to last years as long as you keep it tightly capped.</li>
            <li> and I use it every single day.</li>
            <li> but this was 3 maybe 4 shades to dark for my beachy blonde hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is dark ash blonde, so it doesnt quite match.</li>
            <li> I had been using NYX&#x27;s powder/wax combo, which I still love and will forever have a place in my heart, but Dipbrow has seriously upped my brow game by a million.</li>
            <li> It appears to be a little darker than \\&quot;blond\\&quot; but not as dark as \\&quot;soft brown\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> You use very little product on a brush so this pot will last a really long, long time.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a lot of success with this product, and the color is too dark for me, I have very blonde hair, but unfortunately it is the lightest they offer in the dip brow,</li>
            <li> I have eyebrows that are thin in certain spots and have patches and this helps get my eyebrows all one color without looking like</li>
            <li> This little jar is gonna last me quite a while</li>
            <li> This one little jar will last me a life time!  </li>
            <li> Truth be told, this jar could last a year or two IF it wouldn&#x27;t dry out first, but I&#x27;m afraid mine will dry out before I get a chance to use it all.</li>
            <li> Although for being blonde this is very dark.</li>
            <li> I bought the lightest brown to start with, and it&#x27;s a tad darker than what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I bought this a few months ago and it&#x27;s already starting to get drier.</li>
            <li> keep the product tightly closed to keep it from drying out.  </li>
            <li> The powders looked more natural but always had a reddish tint to it, which I hated.</li>
            <li> I am a pale blonde with minimal brows and combination to oily skin.  </li>
            <li> I only wish it was slightly lighter!</li>
            <li> I have pale (almost white), sparse brows.  </li>
            <li> I got the lightest shade possible, it seemed a *little* dark to me</li>
            <li> I do however think it&#x27;s a little dark for Blonde.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with using the product .</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way !</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way with this stuff!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small jar, but it&#x27;s going to last a looooong time.</li>
            <li> product wears longer than any other brow product I have used and stays in place in heat, humidity, and rain.</li>
            <li> All though it says its water proof I found it coming off like any other product .</li>
            <li> The only complaint I can even think of is be careful of what color you choose.  </li>
            <li> Though this is a little darker than I expected it still works for me.  </li>
            <li> I just use the brush part to go over each brow needing adjustment and it removes the excess.&lt;br /&gt;Altho&#x27; I attempted to find online any stores in my area that sells the product and it came up with &amp;#34;none&amp;#34;, I was in the mall&#x27;s JC Pennys to watch my granddaughter find a Homecoming dress for the dance, and we meandered into the makeup dept. of same store, and there were the small little jars.  </li>
            <li> and they praise it to no end, but I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s not worth the money</li>
            <li> auburn looks dark gray.</li>
            <li> My hair is dark blond</li>
            <li> My hair is gray so when I try eyebrow products they turn out too dark even if they are lighter than my brows.  </li>
            <li> if you have dark brows, go a shade darker.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would be lighter being for blondes, but its still prettttty dark.</li>
            <li> I am 60 years old and have always had thin eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It takes a few tries to get the hang of it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed other people have issues with this product drying out, but I&#x27;ve never had that problem!</li>
            <li> You only need a very small amount</li>
            <li> I do have to use powder that is slightly darker to give the illusion of a brow and this makes it easier to do.</li>
            <li> I find that if it looks too dark, a few swipes with a tissue removed any excess.</li>
            <li> I use thick lotion on my face and a foundation for dry skin</li>
            <li> I find that a little bit goes a long way so while it might seem expensive, I can see this pot lasting me years.</li>
            <li> I would recommend practicing with it a little before applying it to go out &amp; about.</li>
            <li> Just takes a little bit of time to get used to using the brush for the dipbrow instead of filling in with a pencil like I did before.</li>
            <li> It fills in the patches like brow powder would, and even holds them in place a little, like a brow gel would.  </li>
            <li> I bought the little angled brush/spoolie from another manufacturer because Anastasia was sold out.</li>
            <li> I use a spoolie to run through my brows to soften it a little.</li>
            <li> I bought this to save the expense of having to purchase the Anastasia Brow Wiz once or twice a month due to the small amount you get for the price.</li>
            <li> If I get a little too heavy-handed making them darker</li>
            <li> and it is still very dark compared to my hair color.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> This color is still dark on me which requires I use a tiny bit on a razor thin, small angled brush.  </li>
            <li> and I have to fill in a lot of my uneven and patchy eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Dried up when I received it</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> I am medium blonde, 68, with a few grays in my brows and there are thin areas.</li>
            <li> Apply it using a stiff slanted brush.  </li>
            <li> I am blonde, so it&#x27;s hard to find a product that is not to dark and that doesn&#x27;t look fake on me.</li>
            <li> Very little needed on brush.</li>
            <li> I usually use a Taupe or brown eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li> People don&#x27;t usually recognize that I&#x27;ve done my eyebrows -</li>
            <li> Instead, they usually guess I&#x27;ve done something to define my eyes.</li>
            <li> So I decided to give the pomade a try, even tho I have been scared of it in the past.</li>
            <li> Have never liked using eyebrow pencils on them because I looked too overdone.</li>
            <li> Mine are quite thin from years of plucking and the follicles are obviously dead.</li>
            <li> It even helps hold your brows into place, so no more brow gel for me!</li>
            <li> When I use it in my clients they usually ask me what brand is it and the shade because they want to get it!</li>
            <li> I put a very small amount on the tip of the brush and smoothed it onto a magnifying mirror to limit the amount of color being applied at once.  </li>
            <li> I seriously doubt I&#x27;ll ever use another product for my brows again that isn&#x27;t Anastasia.</li>
            <li> It has a weird orangey tint to it... just slightly.</li>
            <li> Your brow game will exceed expectations with this.</li>
            <li> This is the WORST most WORTHLESS product (s) I&#x27;ve ever bought in my life</li>
            <li> I thought that if I tried it out it would match and that the color would blend out, but sadly it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I am totally a novice at eyebrow makeup and have found that pencil and powders just make me look insane.</li>
            <li> (pencil thin eyebrows, be damned!)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll still use it though since it&#x27;s kinda expensive .</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Fantastic product! I have somewhat sparse eyebrows, and this product fills them in naturally. It stays on all day with no smudging. No complaints -- I just wish I found this earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a natural light brunette with blond all-over highlights. The blond was definitely the right choice -- it&#x27;s a very pigmented product, so if you&#x27;re choosing between two shades, go for the lighter one.</li>
            <li> Although this product took a few tries a to master, it looks amazing! Before trying Anastasia&#x27;s dipbrow, I used brow pencils most of the time because I found them to be more precise. With dipbrow, so long as you have a fine-tip/slanted brush &amp; spoolie, this product can actually even more precise than a pencil! There are several videos on youtube that really help you find the right way to apply the product but basically the less-is-more approach seems to work the best for most people. Once it&#x27;s on, you can swim, sweat, battle dragons, etc &amp; your dipbrow will stay put. I actually prefer this to the make forever waterproof brow gel in terms of longwear-ness (there&#x27;s probably a better term for that, just can&#x27;t think of it right now). I would recommend practicing with it a little before applying it to go out &amp; about. Once you find the best technique for your unique, desired brow shape, you&#x27;ll  fall in love with this product.</li>
            <li> Not quite blonde enough to me, but the best color I have found.</li>
            <li> I have pale (almost white), sparse brows.  I use the blonde Dipbrow Pomade using an eyeliner brush followed with the Bdellium Tools Professional Makeup Brush Pink Bambu Series - Lash 733 to achieve a full, natural brow.  This is my favorite new makeup &amp;#34;trick&amp;#34; as the results are excellent.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product looks when applied. It allows for fuller, defined brows without the appearance of being obviously drawn-on.  This product lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t smudge easily.  I only wish it was slightly lighter! I have to use it VERY sparingly so my brows aren&#x27;t freakishly dark.</li>
            <li> The color is too cool for me, too grey...  it looks much warmer in the picture...</li>
            <li> This is awesome ! It stays on all day</li>
            <li> Best product for flawless brows</li>
            <li> This is worth every penny. :) There is nothing else like this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best makeup to get natural looking brows, true to color for my blonde hair. I am getting tons of compliments on my eyebrows! Just takes a little bit of time to get used to using the brush for the dipbrow instead of filling in with a pencil like I did before. It even helps hold your brows into place, so no more brow gel for me! Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Great for thin brows.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t jumped on the Dipbrow bandwagon yet, I highly recommend that you give it a try!!!  I have unruly, patchy eyebrows and this stuff is a godsend.  It fills in the patches like brow powder would, and even holds them in place a little, like a brow gel would.  I have been using this now for about 10 months, and my brows have never looked better.  If you are a first timer, apply lightly- you can always build up more coverage as you go.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way ! I&#x27;m a blonde and this color matches perfect!!</li>
            <li> This was deceiving. I thought it was a powder. But it was cream. Yuk</li>
            <li> I have faint blond brows, and this is the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever found for them as far as staying power and looking natural. Also, it lasts and lasts. Great!</li>
            <li> Though this is a little darker than I expected it still works for me.  My brows (what I have) are brown and my hair is well on it&#x27;s way to becoming gray, but this looks better than anything else I have tried.  I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of money invested in trying different products for brows but so far this looks like a keeper.  I bought the caramel color at the same time and I wear it occasionally when I am not going any where.  On me it has a reddish brown color.  I prefer the blond color.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a lot of success with this product, and the color is too dark for me, I have very blonde hair, but unfortunately it is the lightest they offer in the dip brow, if you have very light brows try the brow wiz</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sure this will last me one year, a little goes a long way, very nice</li>
            <li> I can get much better results with an eyebrow  pencil.</li>
            <li> I was expecting the product to be light since I got the one in blonde, but it was very dark. Much darker than I expected it to be. I thought that if I tried it out it would match and that the color would blend out, but sadly it didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve watched beauty gurus on YouTube try this out and they praise it to no end, but I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s not worth the money and you&#x27;d honestly be better off with an eyebrow pencil and some shadow to set it.</li>
            <li> I love anastasia dipbrow pomade!&lt;br /&gt;Stays put all day and night!! I mix blonde with auburn. Goes on very smooth and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love this product and it is so beautiful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a year now and I&#x27;m totally hooked! I love how you can do a stronger or softer brow with the same product just depending on how much you blend. Definitely would recommend this product. Might i add that I&#x27;ve had the same pot of it for almost a year and it still hasn&#x27;t ran out! I&#x27;ve attached a picture of me wearing it an in the picture I;m wearing the blonde shade just for reference. The blonde shade has worked while I had bleach blonde hair and now with my dark blonde hair. All in all it really is a great value, great bye, great product:)</li>
            <li> Amazing product - I can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love it!! If you want perfect bold brows this is the product for you! You&#x27;ll love it!!</li>
            <li> This  is the most hideous makeup purchase I&#x27;ve ever made in my entire life. I read the reviews which I realize now are total bulls***!!! My eyebrows looked gray YES GRAY when I complete waste of money on my brows. I even tried 2 different both equally suck.  Blonde looks light gray on my brows auburn looks dark gray. Don&#x27;t waste your money.  This is the WORST most WORTHLESS product (s) I&#x27;ve ever bought in my life</li>
            <li> I  would never ever use another product to fill is my eyebrows. This product is great. I am using it with a Sigma brush and they look very natural. I am blonde, so it&#x27;s hard to find a product that is not to dark and that doesn&#x27;t look fake on me. But, this product makes my eyebrows look very natural.</li>
            <li> I really love this dipbrow. It goes on easily, stays on all day, and is the perfect shade for me. A tiny, tiny amount goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> LOVE love love. Forever ordering.</li>
            <li> I am totally a novice at eyebrow makeup and have found that pencil and powders just make me look insane. this gives you more control and looks natural. make sure you keep the top on, it dries out really fast. It&#x27;s easy to use with an angled brush spooly thing---but the blond is more like an ashy gray...better than red for sure, but darker than I thought. Doesn&#x27;t take much, just use a little. I would def order again.</li>
            <li> I got the lightest shade possible, it seemed a *little* dark to me but I have actually gotten compliments on my eyebrows when I wear it. Who compliments eyebrows?!?  I&#x27;ve recommended this product to friends, and it does what it says. I thought I was being innovative to think it could be used as eye liner as well (a subtle one).  Stays on with oily skin and that woman-of-a-certain-age glow (is it hot in here or is it me? yeah, it&#x27;s me).</li>
            <li> I learned about this from a YouTube tutorial, and decided to splurge and try it.. I usually use a cover girl pencil, but I use it up so quickly that I decided to find something longer lasting. The pomade is fabulous! It stays on ALL day, and it looks very natural. It does take some practice.. And it does not come with a brush. I purchased a small angled brush and it works great. A little bit goes a long way with this stuff! This will definitely be a product I will keep in my make up bag as long as they are making it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I bought the little angled brush/spoolie from another manufacturer because Anastasia was sold out. I bought the blonde after watching a YouTube video of a woman with similar eyebrow and skin colour to mine. I usually use a Taupe or brown eyebrow pencil. I think the darker colours would have been too drastic. My husband was impressed and said it looks like I just have eyebrows now. Mine are quite thin from years of plucking and the follicles are obviously dead. I use thick lotion on my face and a foundation for dry skin AND I live in Texas heat. This stuff stays on all day! Get it while you can, I think it&#x27;s going to be sold out all the time once the word really gets out there.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and it stays true even on my oily skin.  You use very little product on a brush so this pot will last a really long, long time.  It&#x27;s essential that you have a very fine angled brush.  Mine is from Japonesque.  A little goes a long way.  The blond shade is a very light taupe without any red or gray, perfect for light or dark blond hair.  The consistency is creamy and you can control the darkness by applying more or less product.  It also helps keep brow hair in place throughout the day.  I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Anastasia has released it&#x27;s newest colors and there now exists \\&quot;taupe\\&quot;.  It appears to be a little darker than \\&quot;blond\\&quot; but not as dark as \\&quot;soft brown\\&quot;.  Upon reflection, I&#x27;ve decided that \\&quot;blond\\&quot; is too light for me, so I will relegate it to the makeup drawer, where the things I don&#x27;t use go to die.  I&#x27;m now using \\&quot;soft brown\\&quot; instead.  My hair is dark blond and I like my brows to be a couple of shades darker than my hair.  The darker shade helps define my eyes better.  I still love this product, I just use a darker shade.  Maybe I&#x27;ll change my mind again as I get older.  I made need a softer look as the years pile on.  For right now, I like the darker look.</li>
            <li> I am a redhead with very light brows and lashes.  The blonde color is perfect for me, and the formula is amazing.  It stays perfect all day!</li>
            <li> So far it works as expected. The color is good. Darker than I thought it would be but matches really well with my natural color. I purchased blonde. The product is very creamy and it will last forever. Very little needed on brush. Overall, happy so far</li>
            <li> Every girl who likes polished brows needs this product. This is a must have. I also love that it is water proof. It doesn&#x27;t budge.</li>
            <li> It was much lighter than I expected. I do need to reapply it 1-2 more times throughout the day. I am not sure what the whole hype is all about. Overpriced!</li>
            <li> I bought the Dipbrow Pomade in blonde. I am a natural blonde (but have colored my hair lighter blonde) and my eyebrows are practically nonexistent; they&#x27;re very, very light blonde and also sparse from plucking too much in the 90s (pencil thin eyebrows, be damned!) This stuff, sed with the Brush - Duo A/S - Mini (#7), gives me a thicker, natural looking brow with a great shape and natural color. Lasts pretty long too, as long as I don&#x27;t scratch my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> This goes on easily and lasts all day.  Plus, it blends a lot better than brow pencil.  I like the color.  I have dark golden (strawberry?) blond hair and it matches nicely.  It also looks good on my daughter who has red hair.</li>
            <li> Fantastic pomade. You just barely tap your brush into this, and it will do the entire brow.  Leaves a very natural appearance, and stays until you take it off.  Filling in the brows is one of the most important makeup steps, I believe for all ladies.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Love this!! Completely waterproof and sweatproof. It both tames existing brows and can be used to fill in sparse spots. The blonde is a nice neutral color too.</li>
            <li> I loooooove this stuff. I&#x27;ve been filling my eyebrows for a while now and this is the best stuff I&#x27;ve come across. First of all, the color. I got the blonde one. I recently dyed my hair blonde. I have pretty dark brown hair naturally so I started bleaching my eyebrows to make them a little bit lighter, since I don&#x27;t like light hair and dark eyebrows. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different eyebrow powders and pencils, but the color was always off. The powders looked more natural but always had a reddish tint to it, which I hated. I like the cooler or neutral tones. The pencils had better color, but I could never get them to look as natural as the powder. This pomade has the perfect color. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a neutral color and is perfect for blondes without a reddish undertone. I also like that you can make it look lighter or darker depending on how much you use. It&#x27;s great at blending, before it dries though. It&#x27;s a nice, natural color. Also, it has great durability. Once this dries, it&#x27;s not coming off, even with water. You have to use makeup remover or soap to get this off. No smudging or anything even if it&#x27;s raining. AWESOME. It&#x27;s a small jar, but it&#x27;s going to last a looooong time. I&#x27;ve used it over 20 times and it still looks brand new. Definitely worth the price. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I am very fair with dark blonde hair, strong cool undertones, and sparse, blond (clear, really) eyebrows that are invisible without makeup. I also have oily skin. My biggest gripe with eyebrow products is that they are usually too warm toned or they can&#x27;t cut it against my oiliness. From the photo of this product I was worried that it would be have a red/gold tone to it but after looking at swatches online I decided to go for it anyway. It is a neutral taupe shade that is much cooler toned than it looks in the photo and works perfectly with my skintone and hair color. It looks almost identical to the Wet N&#x27; Wild taupe brow pencil I have been using for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product wears longer than any other brow product I have used and stays in place in heat, humidity, and rain. It lasts through a 12 hour workday with no problem. I have gone running while wearing this and found my brows to be on point during and after. I missed a spot with my makeup remover last night and looked up to see that a chunk of one of my eyebrows was still filled in even after a 15 minute shower!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to apply with an angled brush. I find that a little bit goes a long way so while it might seem expensive, I can see this pot lasting me years. I prefer a more natural look with my eyebrows as opposed to the super defined &amp;#34;powerbrow&amp;#34; that is so in right now and this is easily achieved by using a lighter hand and blending a bit with a mascara wand or spoolie.  This is now a must-have in my makeup kit!</li>
            <li> My brows have never looked better. I love this stuff. A bit pricey but so so worth it.</li>
            <li> If you need a quick way to enhance your brows and go, then this is not the product for you. This takes time and precision. I am a pale blonde with minimal brows and combination to oily skin.  I was looking for that one Holy Grail product that would give me  consistent color and wearability. I don&#x27;t want to touch up my brows during the day. With that said I still am using an eyebrow pencil, the Dipbrow Pomade and an eyebrow powder to set the pomade in order to get the staying power i am looking for.  The Pros for this product are,  the color which is what i would call a &#x27;true taupe&#x27;,(grayish tan), the smooth consistency of the formula and the value because a littel goes a long way. It does not dry up in the pot. This color is still dark on me which requires I use a tiny bit on a razor thin, small angled brush.  Just barely touch the pomade and start filling in at the center of your brows working your way back towards the tail first and then with what is remaining on the brush move toward the front of your brows. For me this is a cream filler which I have to follow up with brow powder to set it. IMHO the NYX Eyebrow Gel is a good dupe for this product. I&#x27;ll keep looking.</li>
            <li> I LOVED this product and I have darker rather than lighter brows.  My hair is gray so when I try eyebrow products they turn out too dark even if they are lighter than my brows.  This was perfect.  I use other Anastasia brands and love their product line.</li>
            <li> Perfect for brows, I love love love it.  Bought NYX&#x27;s as well since it came out 3 days after buying this, and NYX is almost as good, but this will not budge until your taking it off</li>
            <li> Perfect color, buildable and smudge proof!</li>
            <li> Great! Does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to do. My eyebrows look amazing!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!  It is very light, so if you have dark brows, go a shade darker.  It isn&#x27;t very cheap, but it will probably dry out before it runs out.  I feel like if your brows look good, the rest of your makeup doesn&#x27;t have to, so it&#x27;s become a key piece of my getting ready routine and I really like to sleep in, so for me to take time to do it in the morning says a lot for the product, although it doesn&#x27;t take long at all to apply.  I really like how it tames brows while darkening them - I probably couldn&#x27;t get the hand of the kits where the color is separate from the wax or gel or whatever it is.  If you&#x27;re challenged like me, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> Color is perfect!  You only need a very small amount so will last a very long time.  Very durable, stays on all day without a touch up!  I have tried many other eyebrow products but the color wasn&#x27;t as natural and had to retouch often.</li>
            <li> Maybe im not using this correctly,  but I dont think it works very well. Im better off using IT cosmetics brow spooly and pencil combo and saving 10 min.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamy and easy to use once you get used to it - especially if you use the spooly side of the Anastasia Brush Duo (#12) to help brush it in! The color is slightly Ashy, not too dark, and not as bold or severe as the Taupe dip brow.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a life-changer! I had been using NYX&#x27;s powder/wax combo, which I still love and will forever have a place in my heart, but Dipbrow has seriously upped my brow game by a million. I ordered the blonde, which was perfect for my dirty blonde hair--not too light, as I had worried. Goes on easily and stays on. I can&#x27;t recommend highly enough!</li>
            <li> Love love love this product . A little goes a long way with using the product . I won&#x27;t go back to pencil or powder . This even lasted through a pool party</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I am 60 years old and have always had thin eyebrows. Have never liked using eyebrow pencils on them because I looked too overdone. I saw someone on You Tube demonstrate this product and I found it here on Amazon at a decent price with shipping since I have Prime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried it I applied too much. You only need a tiny bit. I use the Ardell Duo Brow Brush to apply it and that is also a wonderful product. I am fair and blonde so the blonde color was a great match. It&#x27;s easy to apply and I soften and blend them with the spoolie end of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should last a long, long time because just a dab is plenty!</li>
            <li> Wow.  This is a fantastic product.  The only complaint I can even think of is be careful of what color you choose.  I bought the lightest brown to start with, and it&#x27;s a tad darker than what I expected.  Okay for wearing at night, but too dark for day-wear.  I came back and bought the &amp;#34;Blonde&amp;#34; for every day wear, and I&#x27;m very happy.  I have dark red/auburn colored hair and very fair skin.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: The Ardell Duo Brow Brush is perfect to use with this pomade.  It worked okay with my old brow brush but worked 100% better once I got the Ardell brush.</li>
            <li> Fabulous. I have sparse eyebrows, oily skin and I live in a warm humid climate. This lasts ALL DAY, no fading or disappearing from oil or sweat. Highly pigmented so you don&#x27;t need much and I have to fill in a lot of my uneven and patchy eyebrows. If you have nice full eyebrows (lucky you) you will need even less product. I highly recommend this product. It really is fabulous.</li>
            <li> Just received and used it for the first time this morning. It is a very good product. Looks great. The color is like a taupe. I am medium blonde, 68, with a few grays in my brows and there are thin areas. I like this more than a pencil as it can also cover the gray.  Make sure you use the right brush, small, stiff and slanted, to apply a tiny amount. It blends well, and the color is good. I  think it will last a long time as long as it doesn&#x27;t dry out.  There is a you tube video with a girl that reviews and demonstrates the product.  It helped me decide to purchase it.  Just search by Dipbrow and it should come up.</li>
            <li> Great product shade! Lost 1/2 an eyebrow to skin cancer and have been creating a brow for years. This works great for me as a base colorbon bard skin. I do have to use powder that is slightly darker to give the illusion of a brow and this makes it easier to do.</li>
            <li> Everythjng about it is awesome. It takes a few tries to get the hang of it but that&#x27;s ok, it would be a full star product but the blonde isn&#x27;t actually blonde. It&#x27;s really hard to find a good blonde for really bleach blonde haird girls. I know have 2 shades darker If you&#x27;re hair is light but this was 3 maybe 4 shades to dark for my beachy blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Your brow game will exceed expectations with this. Best stuff you can use, applies smoothly and looks natural! A little goes a long way so it lasts and worth the money 100%!</li>
            <li> I love the heck out of anything Anastasia makes. Truth be told, this jar could last a year or two IF it wouldn&#x27;t dry out first, but I&#x27;m afraid mine will dry out before I get a chance to use it all. I bought this a few months ago and it&#x27;s already starting to get drier. I use it with a stiff angle brush (specifically a MAC #266) and it&#x27;s perfect. After I put it on I use a spoolie to run through my brows to soften it a little. It wears all day, doesn&#x27;t smudge, and is the perfect color blonde I was looking for. I bleach my hair and it&#x27;s a very light natural blond color so it can be difficult to find the right brow shade. I seriously doubt I&#x27;ll ever use another product for my brows again that isn&#x27;t Anastasia. It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I bought this to save the expense of having to purchase the Anastasia Brow Wiz once or twice a month due to the small amount you get for the price. I was worried I wouldn&#x27;t know how to use it correctly since I had never used a brow brush before. I was also worried that it wouldn&#x27;t look as natural as the Brow Wiz, but after three days I had it figured out. I basically don&#x27;t have natural brows and this Pomade makes me look like I have perfect natural brows. I have platinum blond hair and this matches perfectly. Once I have used my Dipbrow Pomade, I simply powder over my brows with my CoverGirl loose powder and brush upward once through with the blending tip of the Ardell Duo Brush I bought with it. That makes them just a shade lighter to match my platinum hair. This little jar is gonna last me quite a while and I use it every single day.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyebrow makeup I have ever used. It lasts all day and goes on so easy and smooth.</li>
            <li> Stayed on well for 8+ hours. I do however think it&#x27;s a little dark for Blonde.</li>
            <li> Best brow product EVER!!!</li>
            <li> Makes brows look amazing!!</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping! Will definitely reorder \!</li>
            <li> as long as you have the right brush this brow product is great! lasts so long and doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li> To help with shade choice</li>
            <li> This works well.  Make sure you clean your brush daily or it will be more difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> Wow!  This one little jar will last me a life time!  I scarcely dip the angle-brush in for a tiny amount, which outlines the upper part of each brow, then fill in....2 tiny dips is all it takes.  The color is near what my now solid white eyebrows USE to be in color.  If I get a little too heavy-handed making them darker then I want, I just use the brush part to go over each brow needing adjustment and it removes the excess.&lt;br /&gt;Altho&#x27; I attempted to find online any stores in my area that sells the product and it came up with &amp;#34;none&amp;#34;, I was in the mall&#x27;s JC Pennys to watch my granddaughter find a Homecoming dress for the dance, and we meandered into the makeup dept. of same store, and there were the small little jars.  I&#x27;d been telling her about them &amp; got to point them out to her.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product w/older women w/white eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I usually use the powder from the drugstore, but it would wipe easily if I forget I have it on. I ordered the blonde color because I have very light brown hair and it is still very dark compared to my hair color.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for a week or two, and its pretty great stay-wise. Doesnt even budge. Application is pretty easy too. The only thing that didnt impress me is the color... I heard people say it was ashy and did not have any red or yellow tint to it. It has a weird orangey tint to it... just slightly. My hair is dark ash blonde, so it doesnt quite match. I thought it would be lighter being for blondes, but its still prettttty dark. I just blend it with my Etude House eye fix pencils, which are both really grey.So in the end, it works out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 10-7-2017&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still using this same pot I bought. A little goes a LONG way. It&#x27;s become a staple and I will definitely be re-purchasing it. It does match my hair color really well. I&#x27;ve told friends to try this product and they love it as much as I do. I&#x27;ve noticed other people have issues with this product drying out, but I&#x27;ve never had that problem! It&#x27;s super creamy and easy to apply. Changed review from 3 to 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The blond color is a soft very light brown.  Apply it using a stiff slanted brush.  (I bought the Anastasia Beverly Hills brush (#12) as the applicator.  I put a very small amount on the tip of the brush and smoothed it onto a magnifying mirror to limit the amount of color being applied at once.  Then pick up a tiny amount on the edge of the brush and apply to the brow in short jabbing strokes.  Pick up more product as needed and apply.  That way you get what looks like tiny brow hairs.  Apply them wherever your own brows are sparse or too light to be seen (I&#x27;m a natural blonde so most of my eyebrows are barely noticeable.)  After it is applied, use a spiral/spooly brush to soften the look.  I find that if it looks too dark, a few swipes with a tissue removed any excess. this looks natural and stays on until you wash it off.  Note: keep the product tightly closed to keep it from drying out.  There is plenty of product, enough to last years as long as you keep it tightly capped.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite makeup product. I use it with the duo brow brush. This pomade lasts all day, provides great definition and filling to light,sparse brows. Fairly waterproof (does tend to fade a little with sweat), but much better than any other pencil, pen or powder I&#x27;ve tried for the brows. Also the little pot lasts so much longer than an eyebrow pencil. I used to go through an entire eyebrow pencil in about a month. I&#x27;ve had this for a month already and have barely made a dent in it. Just make sure to screw the cap back on very tightly to prevent it from drying out.&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I have light brown hair with gold highlights and very ashy light brown brows and the blonde looks much better than taupe. It matches my hair and provides definition to my face. Defining my eyebrows really brings out my eyes and I get lots of complements. People don&#x27;t usually recognize that I&#x27;ve done my eyebrows - it looks so natural. Instead, they usually guess I&#x27;ve done something to define my eyes.</li>
            <li> I am a professional Makeup artist and I love this!! When I use it in my clients they usually ask me what brand is it and the shade because they want to get it!</li>
            <li> I’ve been using Dipbrow Pomade - Blonde and Chocolate to achieve the gradient eyebrows. These are the best eyebrow product out there. I’ve been using it since it as released. This  Dipbrow Pomade is perfect for those who have little hair like myself. Anastasia have the best eyebrows product out in the market. I would totally recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to using eyebrow pencils again. It applies easily and smoothly, no smudging or melting from oily skin. Lasts all day. I am in love!!!</li>
            <li> Product stays on great but a little too dark for my light blonde hair...I also wish it came with a brush/applicator, I had to buy separate.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best product for eyebrows ! I&#x27;ve tried Anastasia brow wiz in caramel but I have found the dipbrow works the best. If you use it with an angled brush it creates perfect brows! I have eyebrows that are thin in certain spots and have patches and this helps get my eyebrows all one color without looking like I used my kid&#x27;s markers. I have blonde hair and medium skin tone and the blonde dipbrow looks great and very natural. The brow pomade helps lock eyebrows in place so you don&#x27;t have to use the Anastasia brow gel. This is a makeup bag must, just make sure you have an angled brush.</li>
            <li> Love it! Still a little dark for me but with a light hand it&#x27;s perfect! Definitely recommend it, especially for blondes or light brunettes!</li>
            <li> Dried up when I received it</li>
            <li> Great color for blondes. A little goes a long way. Make sure to keep the lid as tight as possible to prevent it from drying out which is common for products in this type of container.</li>
            <li> Phenomenal product. Don&#x27;t use too much!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I&#x27;ve been filling/shaping my brows in for the past 7 years, alwas looking for the next best thing, but always using a pencil - usually Mac in fling. But I wanted a more sculpted, thicker look (and something that didn&#x27;t run out every few weeks!) So I decided to give the pomade a try, even tho I have been scared of it in the past. It will take some practice, but there are lots of youtube videos out there to show you how to apply. The blonde is a perfect color, about the same as &amp;#34;fling&amp;#34;. Stays on until you wash it off. I bought the #12 pencil and it&#x27;s a great combo. Also, shipping was quick, as promised.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous! I have an issue with brow color turning warm on me. Dip brow is a nice cool color for lighter brows. ***But make sure ur brows are clean with no oil or other brow color before using, otherwise this product will turn very dark!!!!</li>
            <li> Definitely not the best . Don&#x27;t get me wrong I love eye brow game but this just hasn&#x27;t worked well for me . All though it says its water proof I found it coming off like any other product . I&#x27;ll still use it though since it&#x27;s kinda expensive .</li>
            <li> I really do love this product. I wear it everyday. The price could be lower, but a tiny pot does last me a while!</li>
            <li> My brows are forever changed. I use this product in combo with Ardell brow powder, and that seems to be the right look and color for me. This makes a great base and draws a great tail, so it is a lot easier to do my brows with this product going on first.</li>
            <li> Great product. Although for being blonde this is very dark.</li>
            <li> YES!!! All I can say is that this stuff is amazing.  It&#x27;s very easy to apply, stays on all day and makes my brows look great. This is WAY better than powder and I have no idea how I managed so long without it.</li>
            <li> easier than i thought to apply....goes on flawlessly. looks great. love it.</li>
