            <li>I have the Taylor laundry detergent which is so great, so I decided to try this.  </li>
            <li>I get a cedar/sage scent with some underlying notes that are pleasant but that I can&#x27;t identify.</li>
            <li>The sibling who was given the cologne as a gift did not mind as he loved the scent, but I realized the Shaving Shop products from TOBS all come in Maroon/Red labeling.  </li>
            <li>I was thinking that I was supposed to dab a bit on the pulse points and call it good</li>
            <li>When I splash it on, I smell good and it wears off in a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use their after shave balm, their shaving soap is good, too.  </li>
            <li>Christmas morning, my dad opened it and loved it automatically.  </li>

            <li>I won&#x27;t even pretend that I have a sophisticated nose for these things</li>
            <li>This seems to perform more like an after shave for me.</li>
            <li>I just use it more like a cologne</li>
            <li>He says he loves it and plans on getting more</li>
            <li>and we both love the smell, it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I love all of their shave products. . . .</li>
            <li>Still p*ssed that I have to pay sales tax on top of everything else.</li>

            <li>We both love this scent.</li>
            <li>It is just fabulous!</li>

            <li>Totally unique.</li>
            <li>Nice masculine, earthy smells that aren&#x27;t flowery.  </li>
            <li>This has a very nice scent, masculine and far from overpowering.</li>
            <li>I simply love this new fragrance.</li>
            <li>I am an anglophile, this particular product makes me so proud, not only is it made in England, it is an exceptionally fine cologne, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>All in all, I LOVE the Taylor of Old Bond Street products.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money to ensure validity.</li>
            <li>but you get just the right about of scent.</li>
            <li>transaction - short, sweet, hassle free with quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>has a fantastic blend of subtle aromatic fragrances and feels really good on the skin, I highly recommend Mr Taylors Cologne to anyone!!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t last more than 2 hours on my skin.</li>
            <li>This is really a more recent addition to my grooming routine</li>
            <li>If you are looking for this scent, go and try it out first at a store and buy it there.</li>
            <li>use all Taylor Of Old Bond Street Colognes however this one is by far my favorite one.....</li>
            <li>It smells good but just almost exactly like pine trees, not sure when I would wear this.</li>
            <li>This Cologne is absolutely stunning!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>or I don&#x27;t really get the scent and</li>
            <li>It is certainly much closer to the shave cream smell.</li>
            <li>While not spot on it is very close</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this version sold by Amazon is real.</li>
            <li>(though I&#x27;ll probably go with the Sandalwood since my wife loves the shaving cream that I use so much).</li>
            <li>The scent is subtle but masculine and has great staying power.  </li>
            <li>I really like that is kind of subtle and not an overpowering scent</li>
            <li>I bought this for my brother who really likes the Taylor of Old Bond Street products.  </li>
            <li>I was looking to try something new, but wanted to stick with this brand because of the high quality.</li>
            <li>I ordered a bottle (which you have to specify that you want the new formula) and just received it in the mail today.</li>
            <li>Very classy scent and not to \\&quot;alcohol-y\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Of course, outside of after shaves, I really don&#x27;t have any experience with scented products.</li>
            <li>My husband was so surprised</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this bottle for a long time, use it daily, and it&#x27;s still half full.  </li>
            <li>It has a subtle, unique fragrance which turns heads and conveys confidence without overpowering.</li>
            <li>It has a subtle smell when it is first applied but completely disappears 5 minutes after wearing it.</li>

            <li> This Cologne is absolutely stunning!!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this producst as I was looking for something a little different.&lt;br /&gt;It has a fantastic blend of subtle aromatic fragrances and feels really good on the skin, I highly recommend Mr Taylors Cologne to anyone!!</li>
            <li> This cologne is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. It has a subtle, unique fragrance which turns heads and conveys confidence without overpowering.</li>
            <li> I am an anglophile, this particular product makes me so proud, not only is it made in England, it is an exceptionally fine cologne, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item as a gift for a family member.  Not only was the wrong scent shipped, it is also a fake.  I ordered Mr. Taylor&#x27;s cologne, but instead I was shipped the Shaving Shop fragrance.  The sibling who was given the cologne as a gift did not mind as he loved the scent, but I realized the Shaving Shop products from TOBS all come in Maroon/Red labeling.  The bottom of the metal lid was also in poor condition as if it had been tampered with.  This is my first bad experience with Amazon</li>
            <li> Check out my review of TOBS Mr. Taylor&#x27;s Cologne on YouTube&lt;br /&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;G0bUszqmEhQ&amp;list&#x3D;PLVLYoG_5nl9eXj6uCfrh1Q_CWmUX-Exf6&amp;index&#x3D;2</li>
            <li> I simply love this new fragrance. I got it somehow blind without a chance to smell it first but I do not regret it!&lt;br /&gt;I use all Taylor Of Old Bond Street Colognes however this one is by far my favorite one.....Strongly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have the Taylor laundry detergent which is so great, so I decided to try this.  It smells good but just almost exactly like pine trees, not sure when I would wear this.</li>
            <li> I collect colognes...this is one that i did not like. Didn&#x27;t last more than 2 hours on my skin. Also, the smell is similar to Claiborne Sport for Men. Overall i did not like the scent. I wish I would have passed on it.</li>
            <li> 4 stars because I love this scent.  One star deducted only because it does not last very long.  I really like that is kind of subtle and not an overpowering scent, just wish it would last longer.</li>
            <li> Smell like a man, baby.  I like the Sandalwood would one only better, but this is great.  I smell pine.  I might smell Patchouli.</li>
            <li> This has a very nice scent, masculine and far from overpowering. I get a cedar/sage scent with some underlying notes that are pleasant but that I can&#x27;t identify. I won&#x27;t even pretend that I have a sophisticated nose for these things but I do know that this is a nice scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am wondering if this is actually a cologne and not an after shave. This seems to perform more like an after shave for me. I have to splash it on like an after shave or I don&#x27;t really get the scent and neither can my wife. Of course, outside of after shaves, I really don&#x27;t have any experience with scented products. This is really a more recent addition to my grooming routine so for all I know, this is what a cologne is suppose to be like. I was thinking that I was supposed to dab a bit on the pulse points and call it good but when I do that, there is no noticeable scent. When I splash it on, I smell good and it wears off in a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outside of the strength, I am very happy with this product. I just use it more like a cologne and it is fine.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my brother who really likes the Taylor of Old Bond Street products.  The scent is subtle but masculine and has great staying power.  He says he loves it and plans on getting more</li>
            <li> My husband was so surprised and we both love the smell, it lasts all day. Will purchase again and again as needed and for gifts.</li>
            <li> Was initially disappointed and still kind of am, but overall I do like the smell. I&#x27;m disappointed as I was basing the smell on the shaving cream of the same name (which I love) and in my opinion it smell nothing like it. It also does not last at all. Within 30 min or so I don&#x27;t even smell it anymore. If they could match the smell of the shaving cream and make it last longer I would by this stuff by the gallon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was informed by a fellow Amazon customer that they had reformulated the cologne so I reached out to Taylor&#x27;s and they confirmed. I ordered a bottle (which you have to specify that you want the new formula) and just received it in the mail today. It is certainly much closer to the shave cream smell. While not spot on it is very close so I&#x27;m pretty happy. Their customer service was excellent as well!</li>
            <li> Not purchased this Cologne before - blind purchase.  Very pleasant, I will keep and use.  I love all of their shave products. . . . Shave creams and soaps are to die for. . . . transaction - short, sweet, hassle free with quick delivery.  As it should be.  Still p*ssed that I have to pay sales tax on top of everything else.</li>
            <li> It has a sophisticated yet refreshing scent. The perfect springtime morning cologne. It is not overpowering and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using the after shave for quite some time so I decided to buy him the cologne, too. We both love this scent. it&#x27;s not overpowering but you get just the right about of scent. Very classy scent and not to \\&quot;alcohol-y\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have purchased the Sandalwood scent in this line in the past. I was looking to try something new, but wanted to stick with this brand because of the high quality. My husband loves this scent too. It is just fabulous!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this bottle for a long time, use it daily, and it&#x27;s still half full.  It is very thin cologne, and evaporates quickly.  That may be a bad thing to some, but not for me.  Not an overpowering scent that announces your arrival before you arrive.  All in all, I LOVE the Taylor of Old Bond Street products.  I use their after shave balm, their shaving soap is good, too.  Nice masculine, earthy smells that aren&#x27;t flowery.  I smell like a man should smell!  Wife approved!</li>
            <li> I bought this with prime from Amazon and agree with the reviews saying that there is no smell. It has a subtle smell when it is first applied but completely disappears 5 minutes after wearing it. I don&#x27;t think this version sold by Amazon is real. If you are looking for this scent, go and try it out first at a store and buy it there. Well worth the money to ensure validity.</li>
            <li> Great smell! Totally unique. Not overpowering. Will buy again...</li>
            <li> I prefer the sandalwood.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad for Christmas.  Neither myself, nor my dad has used any TOBS cologne before. Before wrapping I smelled it and I liked it alot. Christmas morning, my dad opened it and loved it automatically.  I&#x27;m planning on buying myself some TOBS cologne (though I&#x27;ll probably go with the Sandalwood since my wife loves the shaving cream that I use so much).</li>
            <li> Smells great, not to strong or perfumi.</li>
