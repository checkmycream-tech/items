            <li>The smell of the Vanilla Passionfruit is amazing!</li>
            <li>I love the blackberry scent the best.</li>
            <li>It is a really pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>I guess it must have worked well because a guy friend also at the vegfest invited me on a mini date afterward and was quite fine getting all close to me &lt;3</li>
            <li>It seems like it is also good at moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I have tried all the scents and all are good.</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t think this product does a good job of keep offensive odors at bay.</li>
            <li>, we are good to go.  </li>
            <li>lol)\\&quot; He was like \\&quot;Yeah, but it&#x27;s smells good.</li>
            <li>would recommend this with caution, as it seems to work for most others, but&lt;br /&gt;not me!</li>
            <li>Love this deodorant!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s way better!</li>
            <li>It smells amazing</li>
            <li>that had any kind of anti-perspirant characteristics.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year now, and it is still effective without all the toxic junk.</li>
            <li>The product description states \\&quot;Vanilla Passion Fruit features tropical passion fruit, guava and warm Madagascar vanilla.\\</li>
            <li>I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this deodorant!!  </li>
            <li>Lavanila brand is just amazing, I&#x27;m so glad I took the \\&quot;risk\\&quot; on the $18 splurge and gave it a shot.</li>
            <li>perfect for sensitive skin types.</li>
            <li>I always used old spice before, but this works great!  </li>
            <li>This is a spray-on and while the smell isn&#x27;t anywhere near as wonderful as Lavanila, this product does a better job of all day BO-prevention.</li>
            <li>It works, and smells great - not too strong, just subtly fresh.</li>
            <li>I personally LOVE the fragrance of the Passion Fruit Deodorant.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for years in place of deodorants with many chemicals.</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant...remember it&#x27;s not an antiperspirant people :-)</li>
            <li>The grapefruit flavor is my favorite.</li>
            <li>love it...</li>
            <li>i will most def repurchase this when it runs out.</li>
            <li>Deodorants with titanium dioxide are overwhelmingly linked to breast cancer.</li>
            <li>I have been on the hunt for healthier, more chemical-free products in my beauty routines.</li>
            <li>I love Lavanila&#x27;s baby products</li>
            <li>Yes, one may have to apply more than once a day depending on activity level, but who cares.</li>
            <li>Plus, I have my stinky kids use it, knowing it&#x27;s healthy.</li>
            <li>What more can one say?</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not my favorite deodorant.  </li>
            <li>the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; with is &amp;#34;passion fruit&amp;#34; is my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to everything and am so pleased that I can use this product.</li>
            <li>I do love the scent.</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I also love the blackberry perfume.</li>
            <li>and I like that much more than the unscented crystal stick.</li>
            <li>In my opinion I think the Passion Fruit smells more like a bar of soap than fruity.  </li>
            <li>:)\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I had high hopes for LaVanila because of the great reviews.</li>
            <li>and I guess that&#x27;s a fair trade off for an amazing natural product.</li>
            <li>and I guess that&#x27;s a fair trade off for an amazing natural product.</li>
            <li>I love the idea though of healthy ingredients and so far so good.</li>
            <li>The passionfruit-vanilla fragrance is one of my favorites, so selecting this scent was an easy choice.  </li>
            <li>STRONG fabric softner.</li>
            <li>I guess it must have worked well because a guy friend also at the vegfest invited me on a mini date afterward and was quite fine getting all close to me &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li>I love the scent, it is fresh and not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>This is an effective natural deodorant and the scent is lovely too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Granted, it is very hot most of the year, where i live, and so this is a problem for me, more than for most individuals.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This deodorant has a really nice smell, applies cleanly and dries fast.</li>
            <li>It lasts me all day, smells great, and has better ingredients than your average grocery store deodorants.  </li>
            <li>The smell out of the jar is something else, but under your arm it goes on like smooth cream and melts into a sweet and somewhat fruity scent.</li>
            <li>I have tried other safe deodorant and  this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>and it glides on super smoothly.</li>
            <li>but it has carried me through the entire fall and winter with pleasant smelling &#x27;pits.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good, natural, safe, smell good, moisturizing everyday deodorant that doesn&#x27;t have aluminum Z.  </li>
            <li>this deodorant does not only smell good, but it also does the job.</li>
            <li>This deodorant goes on wonderfully smooth, smells delicious and natural, and last the longest of any natural deodorant I have used.</li>
            <li>If you keep re-applying all day, that helps keep the smells down, but for $14 a pop, I wish it was more effective.</li>
            <li>At this point I realize, smelling professional at work and like a lady at home is worth much more than $.50 a day or whatever that works out to in the long-run.</li>
            <li>I have tried several natural deodorants and this is BY FAR the best.</li>
            <li>This is just the nature of more natural deodorants.</li>
            <li>I love that this is a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed the two scents I&#x27;ve tried so far (vanilla passion fruit and vanilla grapefruit) .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to know I am not putting toxic chemicals on my skin daily.</li>
            <li>I still think it is worth it not to be poisoning myself.</li>
            <li>Others have reported this type of reaction, but it does seem to be relatively rare.</li>
            <li>and I still feel fresh at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>so I just needed something to make me smell fresh.  </li>
            <li>Luckily my mom decided to treat me and was willing to pay for a deodorant I wanted at the Sephora store.</li>
            <li>Aluminum is in most deodorants, and that is a toxic metal that you are putting right on your lymph nodes daily.  </li>
            <li>I can sometimes still smell the scent of the deodorant, but it is pleasant and not strong.  </li>
            <li>I can only imagine some of the lower scoring scent-related reviews are on some of the more musky scents.</li>
            <li>I gave it a shot, expecting mediocre coverage at best.</li>
            <li>I only work an office job), I need to apply more.</li>
            <li>It absolutely does not!</li>
            <li>At first sniff, I smelled bug spray, but my husband went to soapy.</li>
            <li>My mom smelled them all and noticed the weird smell too, but we both agreed that the passionfruit smelled the best out of all of them</li>
            <li>but it has no nasty aluminum, and it does work substantially better than some of the other natural deodorants</li>
            <li>My daughter is heavily active in sports and when she applies this before practice, it&#x27;s 100% effective at stopping under-arm odors.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t keep me fresh, I ordered Green Tidings and have loved it so far.</li>
            <li>And as far as I can see that is true.</li>
            <li>It still might be a good idea to have a small sample to reapply just in case though as everyone&#x27;s body is</li>
            <li>It still might be a good idea to have a small sample to reapply just in case though as everyone&#x27;s body is</li>
            <li>This one requires more applications and still doesn&#x27;t make it very long in anti-stinkiness.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do much to keep the odor at bay.</li>
            <li>The deodorant itself works really well.</li>
            <li>This is my second shot at a more natural deodorant</li>
            <li>I have tried MANY different vegan and natural deodorants like Kiss</li>
            <li>I like the scent and find that it works as well as or better than any other deodorant I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first natural version I&#x27;ve ever used that made me feel like a LADY.</li>
            <li>One of my guy friends instantly noticed when I had it on and was like \\&quot;What is that sweet smell?\\</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m reviewing this particular scent as 3 stars since it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the staying power as the Vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>I was really worried about not having an antiperspirant, because I can get sweaty, so far not a problem!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I love the scent, and the formula did not cause me a rash like other natural deodorant products containing baking soda or tea tree oil have before.</li>
            <li>ive tried every natural deodorant out there from toms to real purity to lafes.</li>
            <li>IT turns out that this particular scent seems to provide more odor protection (not sure why?)</li>
            <li>&quot; I was like \\&quot;Oh, that&#x27;s probably my new deodorant.</li>
            <li>lol crazy to me, but for a natural product that really works I suppose you&#x27;d be asking to pay a little more.</li>
            <li>But for right not I&#x27;m not completely sold on THIS brand.</li>
            <li>Not really pleasant honestly</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a long lasting vegan deodorant that&#x27;s all natural and aluminum free</li>
            <li>Along with that, as in most natural deodorants, you will have to reapply because it simply isn&#x27;t going to last as long as something with a bunch of chemicals.</li>
            <li>But I certainly didn&#x27;t smell \\&quot;pretty\\&quot; - especially after a workout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate me at all.</li>
            <li>Something you have to understand about natural deodorants</li>
            <li>This is a natural product that isn&#x27;t harmful and</li>
            <li>As soon as I switched to another natural deodorant the rash began to disappear and is now completely gone.  </li>
            <li>this beats em all by far.</li>
            <li>It has not stained any of our clothes, unlike the old store-brand stuff we used to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This happens to me with the creamier types of natural deoderants.</li>
            <li>Could be paranoia since I know I&#x27;m wearing natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t had an issues so far.</li>
            <li>It seems to last a few hours on me, which is better than nothing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will likely not use this in social situations where I positively need to NOT smell like BO</li>
            <li>(Delicious smelling, but DID NOT LAST for more than 3 hours and afterwards I would have some serious B.O and was unfortunately in some awkward situations goofing around with guy friends when it \\&quot;wore off\\&quot; x__X. ), Thai Crystal (works fairly well I think, but I realized I wanted a little scent).</li>
            <li>I really hope Lavanila changes their formula a little because I really do enjoy the smell of the Vanilla Passionfruit over every other deodorant I&#x27;ve tried, but for now, I won&#x27;t be re-purchasing this.</li>
            <li>it seemed to hold off any major B.O.</li>
            <li>it seemed to hold off any major B.O.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it one week so far and apply 2-3 times a day.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think it works well for a natural d.o.  </li>
            <li>O_O They ALL smelled like fabric softner out of the jar.</li>
            <li>I bought this one and while it smells better, it&#x27;s not great.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve finally found a natural deodorant that actually performs.</li>
            <li>I can put it on one day, and smell it lingering on me the next day, and the best part, so far, it doesn&#x27;t leave me smelling awful after it wears off like I hear and know some of the Tom&#x27;s of Maine and Bubble &amp; Bee stuff does!!!!</li>
            <li>I wore this on a HOT day while I worked at a Vegfest and while the scent didn&#x27;t really last(most likely due to a few months after being opened)</li>
            <li>I wore this on a HOT day while I worked at a Vegfest and while the scent didn&#x27;t really last(most likely due to a few months after being opened)</li>
            <li>lol crazy to me, but for a natural product that really works I suppose you&#x27;d be asking to pay a little more.does start to wear off in general after a few months, but it still works</li>

            <li> I guess it must have worked well because a guy friend also at the vegfest invited me on a mini date afterward and was quite fine getting all close to me &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> I love the scent, it is fresh and not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> This is an effective natural deodorant and the scent is lovely too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Granted, it is very hot most of the year, where i live, and so this is a problem for me, more than for most individuals.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This deodorant has a really nice smell, applies cleanly and dries fast.</li>
            <li> It lasts me all day, smells great, and has better ingredients than your average grocery store deodorants.  </li>
            <li> The smell out of the jar is something else, but under your arm it goes on like smooth cream and melts into a sweet and somewhat fruity scent.</li>
            <li> I have tried other safe deodorant and  this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> and it glides on super smoothly.</li>
            <li> but it has carried me through the entire fall and winter with pleasant smelling &#x27;pits.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good, natural, safe, smell good, moisturizing everyday deodorant that doesn&#x27;t have aluminum Z.  </li>
            <li> this deodorant does not only smell good, but it also does the job.</li>
            <li> This deodorant goes on wonderfully smooth, smells delicious and natural, and last the longest of any natural deodorant I have used.</li>
            <li> If you keep re-applying all day, that helps keep the smells down, but for $14 a pop, I wish it was more effective.</li>
            <li> At this point I realize, smelling professional at work and like a lady at home is worth much more than $.50 a day or whatever that works out to in the long-run.</li>
            <li> I have tried several natural deodorants and this is BY FAR the best.</li>
            <li> This is just the nature of more natural deodorants.</li>
            <li> I love that this is a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed the two scents I&#x27;ve tried so far (vanilla passion fruit and vanilla grapefruit) .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to know I am not putting toxic chemicals on my skin daily.</li>
            <li> I still think it is worth it not to be poisoning myself.</li>
            <li> Others have reported this type of reaction, but it does seem to be relatively rare.</li>
            <li> and I still feel fresh at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> so I just needed something to make me smell fresh.  </li>
            <li> Luckily my mom decided to treat me and was willing to pay for a deodorant I wanted at the Sephora store.</li>
            <li> Aluminum is in most deodorants, and that is a toxic metal that you are putting right on your lymph nodes daily.  </li>
            <li> I can sometimes still smell the scent of the deodorant, but it is pleasant and not strong.  </li>
            <li> I can only imagine some of the lower scoring scent-related reviews are on some of the more musky scents.</li>
            <li> I gave it a shot, expecting mediocre coverage at best.</li>
            <li> I only work an office job), I need to apply more.</li>
            <li> It absolutely does not!</li>
            <li> At first sniff, I smelled bug spray, but my husband went to soapy.</li>
            <li> My mom smelled them all and noticed the weird smell too, but we both agreed that the passionfruit smelled the best out of all of them</li>
            <li> but it has no nasty aluminum, and it does work substantially better than some of the other natural deodorants</li>
            <li> My daughter is heavily active in sports and when she applies this before practice, it&#x27;s 100% effective at stopping under-arm odors.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t keep me fresh, I ordered Green Tidings and have loved it so far.</li>
            <li> And as far as I can see that is true.</li>
            <li> It still might be a good idea to have a small sample to reapply just in case though as everyone&#x27;s body is</li>
            <li> It still might be a good idea to have a small sample to reapply just in case though as everyone&#x27;s body is</li>
            <li> This one requires more applications and still doesn&#x27;t make it very long in anti-stinkiness.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do much to keep the odor at bay.</li>
            <li> The deodorant itself works really well.</li>
            <li> This is my second shot at a more natural deodorant</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY different vegan and natural deodorants like Kiss</li>
            <li> I like the scent and find that it works as well as or better than any other deodorant I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first natural version I&#x27;ve ever used that made me feel like a LADY.</li>
            <li> One of my guy friends instantly noticed when I had it on and was like \\&quot;What is that sweet smell?\\</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reviewing this particular scent as 3 stars since it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the staying power as the Vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> I was really worried about not having an antiperspirant, because I can get sweaty, so far not a problem!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love the scent, and the formula did not cause me a rash like other natural deodorant products containing baking soda or tea tree oil have before.</li>
            <li> ive tried every natural deodorant out there from toms to real purity to lafes.</li>
            <li> IT turns out that this particular scent seems to provide more odor protection (not sure why?)</li>
            <li> &quot; I was like \\&quot;Oh, that&#x27;s probably my new deodorant.</li>
            <li> lol crazy to me, but for a natural product that really works I suppose you&#x27;d be asking to pay a little more.</li>
            <li> But for right not I&#x27;m not completely sold on THIS brand.</li>
            <li> Not really pleasant honestly</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a long lasting vegan deodorant that&#x27;s all natural and aluminum free</li>
            <li> Along with that, as in most natural deodorants, you will have to reapply because it simply isn&#x27;t going to last as long as something with a bunch of chemicals.</li>
            <li> But I certainly didn&#x27;t smell \\&quot;pretty\\&quot; - especially after a workout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate me at all.</li>
            <li> Something you have to understand about natural deodorants</li>
            <li> This is a natural product that isn&#x27;t harmful and</li>
            <li> As soon as I switched to another natural deodorant the rash began to disappear and is now completely gone.  </li>
            <li> this beats em all by far.</li>
            <li> It has not stained any of our clothes, unlike the old store-brand stuff we used to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This happens to me with the creamier types of natural deoderants.</li>
            <li> Could be paranoia since I know I&#x27;m wearing natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had an issues so far.</li>
            <li> It seems to last a few hours on me, which is better than nothing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will likely not use this in social situations where I positively need to NOT smell like BO</li>
            <li> (Delicious smelling, but DID NOT LAST for more than 3 hours and afterwards I would have some serious B.O and was unfortunately in some awkward situations goofing around with guy friends when it \\&quot;wore off\\&quot; x__X. ), Thai Crystal (works fairly well I think, but I realized I wanted a little scent).</li>
            <li> I really hope Lavanila changes their formula a little because I really do enjoy the smell of the Vanilla Passionfruit over every other deodorant I&#x27;ve tried, but for now, I won&#x27;t be re-purchasing this.</li>
            <li> it seemed to hold off any major B.O.</li>
            <li> it seemed to hold off any major B.O.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it one week so far and apply 2-3 times a day.</li>
            <li> Overall, I think it works well for a natural d.o.  </li>
            <li> O_O They ALL smelled like fabric softner out of the jar.</li>
            <li> I bought this one and while it smells better, it&#x27;s not great.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve finally found a natural deodorant that actually performs.</li>
            <li> I can put it on one day, and smell it lingering on me the next day, and the best part, so far, it doesn&#x27;t leave me smelling awful after it wears off like I hear and know some of the Tom&#x27;s of Maine and Bubble &amp; Bee stuff does!!!!</li>
            <li> I wore this on a HOT day while I worked at a Vegfest and while the scent didn&#x27;t really last(most likely due to a few months after being opened)</li>
            <li> I wore this on a HOT day while I worked at a Vegfest and while the scent didn&#x27;t really last(most likely due to a few months after being opened)</li>
            <li> lol crazy to me, but for a natural product that really works I suppose you&#x27;d be asking to pay a little more.does start to wear off in general after a few months, but it still works</li>
            <li> My inclination is to order more in the plain Vanilla scent, hoping that it will not have the same icky, chemical odor.</li>
            <li> I am less active, but even walking/working out on hot days, this prevents odor for me as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this, as the positive aspects way out weigh the negative, and I will continue to repurchase!</li>
            <li> Having always leaned towards natural products when possible, I never seemed to have found anything in the past (and I tried them all)</li>
            <li> I wish I would have discovered this product long time ago.</li>
            <li> but i can use it in the morning and have no odor allllll day long.</li>
            <li> Plus the EO spray is $4 and lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> I ordered another Vanilla and highly recommend that since it seems to make through even my most brutal of workout sessions.</li>
            <li> The smell in the jar, and also under your arms does start to wear off in general after a few months, but it still works</li>
            <li> The vanilla seemed to do a decent job at odor protection on non-hot days and the Vanilla/Lavender was a failure -</li>
            <li> If I am at work sitting at my desk all day, it does last all day, but if I am out and about, it will lose its glory about half way through the day.  </li>
            <li> So yes, if you run a marathon, you are going to sweat, the deodorant is going to wear off due to the sweat, and you will smell like a pig.</li>
            <li> It may not work quite as well as the other antiperspirants you can buy at Target</li>
            <li> I am an active smelly girl, and I don&#x27;t want to use chemicals to prevent or mask that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid a bit less for other brands that I would review as \\&quot;worked.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> you definitely have to reapply at least once if not twice plus a day.  </li>
            <li> I will put this on clean skin, go to my desk job which is not a major sweating event, and by lunch time my pits are rank with BO.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel like I&#x27;m using less chemicals in our chemical world.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was hesitant at first as the price seems crazy to me for a deodorant.</li>
            <li> I am not super smelly or a heavy sweater, but this works for me.</li>
            <li> They claim that that I know harsh chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> My Face Cumcumber &amp; Green Tee</li>
            <li> (worked but left an irritating residue under the arms), Bubble &amp; Bee</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m used to paying less than $10!)</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this scent, but no other non-aluminum deodorant has worked for me and</li>
            <li> Now I may not love it if I were sweating heavily.  </li>
            <li> I have a small size I carry in my purse so that I can use it while I&#x27;m out if I feel it is wearing off.</li>
            <li> This works for about 3 hours for me, and at that point re-applying is pointless</li>
            <li> Sadly, it has lately caused a red rash under my arms, so I have had to discontinue using it.</li>
            <li> Not very good at preventing underarm odors, I use this deodorant at night.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> This does not mean it is a bad deodorant.</li>
            <li> This is a really expensive product considering the limited deodorizing power.</li>
            <li> Lavanila products at least don&#x27;t cause skin rashes.</li>
            <li> least it doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I can ride my bike, go for a hike, or go to yoga smelling like subtle passion fruit.</li>
            <li> Might work for others, but it made me smell worse than wearing no deodorant!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have friends who do use this and recommend it highly.&lt;br /&gt;Trying to stop using aluminum containing deodorants is frustrating.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the hippie natural deodorants often smell worst than pit stank.</li>
            <li> This product has a weird smell to begin with</li>
            <li> I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, but I can&#x27;t use anything else now.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I purchased the three-pack, so I am stuck with some pricy yet smelly deodorant.  </li>
            <li> This is expensive-  too expensive but in comparison to Tom&#x27;s</li>
            <li> My axilla NEVER smelled bad.  </li>
            <li> I do not recommend lavanila, I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I hated the way it smelled.</li>
            <li> That means, I didn&#x27;t smell disgusting at the end of a day.</li>
            <li> For a product that is naturally-derived, its scent shockingly resembled the bug spray in aerosol cans that my grandmother used years ago to kill wasps.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I can only imagine some of the lower scoring scent-related reviews are on some of the more musky scents. I personally LOVE the fragrance of the Passion Fruit Deodorant. It&#x27;s the first natural version I&#x27;ve ever used that made me feel like a LADY. I&#x27;ve paid a bit less for other brands that I would review as \\&quot;worked.\\&quot; That means, I didn&#x27;t smell disgusting at the end of a day. But I certainly didn&#x27;t smell \\&quot;pretty\\&quot; - especially after a workout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lavanila brand is just amazing, I&#x27;m so glad I took the \\&quot;risk\\&quot; on the $18 splurge and gave it a shot. At this point I realize, smelling professional at work and like a lady at home is worth much more than $.50 a day or whatever that works out to in the long-run. If you&#x27;re worried and unsure, give it a shot - Sephora takes all used products back without question if you end up not liking it!</li>
            <li> Might work for others, but it made me smell worse than wearing no deodorant!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this with caution, as it seems to work for most others, but&lt;br /&gt;not me!</li>
            <li> This is an effective natural deodorant and the scent is lovely too. I have been using this for years in place of deodorants with many chemicals.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant...remember it&#x27;s not an antiperspirant people :-)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t keep me fresh, I ordered Green Tidings and have loved it so far. This one just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I have tried several natural deodorants and this is BY FAR the best. This deodorant goes on wonderfully smooth, smells delicious and natural, and last the longest of any natural deodorant I have used. I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate me at all. It seems like it is also good at moisturizing. Something you have to understand about natural deodorants, they are ONLY deodorants and not antiperspirants. So yes, if you run a marathon, you are going to sweat, the deodorant is going to wear off due to the sweat, and you will smell like a pig. This does not mean it is a bad deodorant. Along with that, as in most natural deodorants, you will have to reapply because it simply isn&#x27;t going to last as long as something with a bunch of chemicals. This is just the nature of more natural deodorants. I have a small size I carry in my purse so that I can use it while I&#x27;m out if I feel it is wearing off. I would definitely recommend this, as the positive aspects way out weigh the negative, and I will continue to repurchase!</li>
            <li> I had the lavanila vanilla grapefuit one before and I hated the way it smelled. I bought this one and while it smells better, it&#x27;s not great. I also have to reapply it several times a day. It doesn&#x27;t do much to keep the odor at bay.</li>
            <li> this deodorant does not only smell good, but it also does the job. They claim that that I know harsh chemicals in it. And as far as I can see that is true. I wish I would have discovered this product long time ago.I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am an active smelly girl, and I don&#x27;t want to use chemicals to prevent or mask that. This is a natural product that isn&#x27;t harmful and the best part is it keeps me smelling good. I can ride my bike, go for a hike, or go to yoga smelling like subtle passion fruit. My boyfriend even uses it sometimes.</li>
            <li> The grapefruit flavor is my favorite. The deodorant itself works really well. I have tried all the scents and all are good. I have tried other safe deodorant and  this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Been using this for two weeks and it is not working! I&#x27;m not a big sweater but after two hours sitting at my desk at work I can smell myself, which is just gross. I&#x27;ve never smelled like body odor in my life, and wanted to give this deodorant another chance but every day is the same. I do not recommend lavanila, I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I tried the Lavanila Vanilla and Vanilla/Lavender deodorants. The vanilla seemed to do a decent job at odor protection on non-hot days and the Vanilla/Lavender was a failure - as I noted in another review for that scent, it failed me when I needed it most. I was skeptical about this scent, but no other non-aluminum deodorant has worked for me and Lavanila products at least don&#x27;t cause skin rashes. I gave it a shot, expecting mediocre coverage at best. IT turns out that this particular scent seems to provide more odor protection (not sure why?) and it glides on super smoothly. It has not caused any itching or burning that often comes with scented deodorants. I will likely not use this in social situations where I positively need to NOT smell like BO but it has carried me through the entire fall and winter with pleasant smelling &#x27;pits. I think I&#x27;ve finally found a natural deodorant that actually performs.</li>
            <li> I love that this is a natural deodorant. I&#x27;ve enjoyed the two scents I&#x27;ve tried so far (vanilla passion fruit and vanilla grapefruit) . They are not too overwhelming,and when I smell them during the day, it&#x27;s a very pleasant smell. I am not super smelly or a heavy sweater, but this works for me.</li>
            <li> Are you kidding?  My axilla NEVER smelled bad.  EWWW.  This product has a weird smell to begin with but how I smelled by the end of the day! stinky.  I don&#x27;t use deodorant every day.  I don&#x27;t need to. But I will NEVER  use this product again.  Wonder if I can return it?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to know I am not putting toxic chemicals on my skin daily. Aluminum is in most deodorants, and that is a toxic metal that you are putting right on your lymph nodes daily.  I like this deodorant.  I like the scent.  It works well for about 4 hours, and then you do need to reapply.  If I am at work sitting at my desk all day, it does last all day, but if I am out and about, it will lose its glory about half way through the day.  I still think it is worth it not to be poisoning myself.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this deodorant.  I like the scent and find that it works as well as or better than any other deodorant I&#x27;ve tried.  Sadly, it has lately caused a red rash under my arms, so I have had to discontinue using it. As soon as I switched to another natural deodorant the rash began to disappear and is now completely gone.  Others have reported this type of reaction, but it does seem to be relatively rare.</li>
            <li> love it...best deodorant ive ever used. smells great, keeps odor away and doesnt break me out at all. perfect for sensitive skin types. if u havent tried this yet, u need to! lol. best deodorant on the market ever. ive tried every natural deodorant out there from toms to real purity to lafes. this beats em all by far. of course you&#x27;re going to sweat, its not an antiperspirant...but i can use it in the morning and have no odor allllll day long. dont have to reapply at all. and the best part is it smells bomb diggity! i will most def repurchase this when it runs out.</li>
            <li> I love the scent, and the formula did not cause me a rash like other natural deodorant products containing baking soda or tea tree oil have before. This works for about 3 hours for me, and at that point re-applying is pointless -I&#x27;d need to shower and reapply. Won&#x27;t stand up to a run or a Crossfit workout, for me. This is a really expensive product considering the limited deodorizing power.</li>
            <li> Totally works and no tit cancer. Yay!! Deodorants with titanium dioxide are overwhelmingly linked to breast cancer. Unfortunately the hippie natural deodorants often smell worst than pit stank. Not this stuff. It works, and smells great - not too strong, just subtly fresh. Somehow it works all day. I don&#x27;t claim to know how it works. It just does.</li>
            <li> I have been on the hunt for healthier, more chemical-free products in my beauty routines. I love Lavanila&#x27;s baby products so I wanted to give this deodorant a try as well. The smell of the Vanilla Passionfruit is amazing! I love the scent, it is fresh and not too overpowering. It is a really pleasant smell. However, I don&#x27;t think this product does a good job of keep offensive odors at bay. I will put this on clean skin, go to my desk job which is not a major sweating event, and by lunch time my pits are rank with BO. If you keep re-applying all day, that helps keep the smells down, but for $14 a pop, I wish it was more effective. Another product I have been trying out is the [[ASIN:B007763OS0 EO Organic Deodorant Spray, Citrus, 4 Fluid Ounce]]. This is a spray-on and while the smell isn&#x27;t anywhere near as wonderful as Lavanila, this product does a better job of all day BO-prevention. Plus the EO spray is $4 and lasts a very long time. I really hope Lavanila changes their formula a little because I really do enjoy the smell of the Vanilla Passionfruit over every other deodorant I&#x27;ve tried, but for now, I won&#x27;t be re-purchasing this.</li>
            <li> Having always leaned towards natural products when possible, I never seemed to have found anything in the past (and I tried them all) that had any kind of anti-perspirant characteristics. Even though this is a deodorant, it totally exceeds my expectations. Yes, one may have to apply more than once a day depending on activity level, but who cares. Plus, I have my stinky kids use it, knowing it&#x27;s healthy. They like it too. What more can one say? I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, but I can&#x27;t use anything else now.</li>
            <li> I found this deodorant from ohsheglows.com, Angela from that blog recommended it.  I agree with her- it&#x27;s not my favorite deodorant.  No aluminum and smells great.  the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; with is &amp;#34;passion fruit&amp;#34; is my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> The best I&#x27;ve tried in years. I&#x27;m allergic to everything and am so pleased that I can use this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this deodorant!!  I&#x27;ve never been a believer of &amp;#34;girl&#x27;s&amp;#34; deodorant.  I always used old spice before, but this works great!  It lasts me all day, smells great, and has better ingredients than your average grocery store deodorants.  WIN-WIN!</li>
            <li> I do love the scent. It seems to last a few hours on me, which is better than nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Granted, it is very hot most of the year, where i live, and so this is a problem for me, more than for most individuals.&lt;br /&gt;I also know that, for some people, this is very effective. Even in my local climate. I have friends who do use this and recommend it highly.&lt;br /&gt;Trying to stop using aluminum containing deodorants is frustrating.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly.  My daughter is heavily active in sports and when she applies this before practice, it&#x27;s 100% effective at stopping under-arm odors.  I am less active, but even walking/working out on hot days, this prevents odor for me as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do we still sweat? Of course.  But remember this is not an anti-perspirant.  And the human body is designed to sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This goes on creamy, and feels moist in the way that a lotion will feel moist on your skin.  Once it soaks in, which for us takes a couple minutes, we are good to go.  I can sometimes still smell the scent of the deodorant, but it is pleasant and not strong.  It has not stained any of our clothes, unlike the old store-brand stuff we used to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also tried Tom&#x27;s of Maine, but it did nothing for us whatsoever and I had to seek a refund.  There is something different in this stuff, and whatever it is, it works.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant.  Now I may not love it if I were sweating heavily.  It&#x27;s a good, natural, safe, smell good, moisturizing everyday deodorant that doesn&#x27;t have aluminum Z.  It makes me feel like I&#x27;m using less chemicals in our chemical world.</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve used. It smells great and I still feel fresh at the end of the day. It is NOT an antiperspirant, so I still sweat but I don&#x27;t feel stinky.</li>
            <li> Love this deodorant! I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year now, and it is still effective without all the toxic junk. I love the blackberry scent the best. Although, I have tried, vanilla, grapefruit, passion fruit, and coconut. The strongest scent is the blackberry that I have tried. I also love the blackberry perfume.</li>
            <li> Ooooo how I wanted this to work out for me. And it did for a month and then the itching began and my underarms looked gray. This happens to me with the creamier types of natural deoderants. I have found that I can only use the alcohol based liquid sprays. The scent of this is very pleasant.</li>
            <li> This deodorant has a really nice smell, applies cleanly and dries fast. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is it doesn&#x27;t last all day. About 3/4 through the workday(and I only work an office job), I need to apply more.</li>
            <li> This is my second shot at a more natural deodorant and I had high hopes for LaVanila because of the great reviews. It smells amazing and I like that much more than the unscented crystal stick. However, as for its effectiveness - the jury is still out. I&#x27;ve only been using it one week so far and apply 2-3 times a day. Could be paranoia since I know I&#x27;m wearing natural deodorant. Could be allowing my body to get acclimated to it. But for right not I&#x27;m not completely sold on THIS brand.</li>
            <li> Not very good at preventing underarm odors, I use this deodorant at night.&lt;br /&gt;At least it doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my skin. It smells lovely, but unfortunately does not work for me.</li>
            <li> Great deodorant! It may not work quite as well as the other antiperspirants you can buy at Target but it has no nasty aluminum, and it does work substantially better than some of the other natural deodorants</li>
            <li> The product description states \\&quot;Vanilla Passion Fruit features tropical passion fruit, guava and warm Madagascar vanilla.\\&quot; So I assumed that it would take on these odors. It absolutely does not! At first sniff, I smelled bug spray, but my husband went to soapy. Either way, once applied, you don&#x27;t smell a thing anyways. I was really worried about not having an antiperspirant, because I can get sweaty, so far not a problem! It is cooler weather now and I haven&#x27;t tried it with real physical exertion, but have my \\&quot;Secret\\&quot; on hand still in an emergency. I love the idea though of healthy ingredients and so far so good.</li>
            <li> I already use their baby products for my daughter, so I didn&#x27;t hesitate when purchasing this.  I don&#x27;t sweat a lot so I just needed something to make me smell fresh.  In my opinion I think the Passion Fruit smells more like a bar of soap than fruity.  But I like the smell and I haven&#x27;t had an issues so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reviewing this particular scent as 3 stars since it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the staying power as the Vanilla scent. This one requires more applications and still doesn&#x27;t make it very long in anti-stinkiness. I ordered another Vanilla and highly recommend that since it seems to make through even my most brutal of workout sessions.</li>
            <li> The only deodorant I use - for well over a year.</li>
            <li> As a long-time user of Lavanila products, I was eager to try this deodorant.  The passionfruit-vanilla fragrance is one of my favorites, so selecting this scent was an easy choice.  However, upon taking a whiff of the newly-opened stick, I immediately thought, &amp;#34;Eeewww, bug spray!&amp;#34;  For a product that is naturally-derived, its scent shockingly resembled the bug spray in aerosol cans that my grandmother used years ago to kill wasps.  Unfortunately, I purchased the three-pack, so I am stuck with some pricy yet smelly deodorant.  My inclination is to order more in the plain Vanilla scent, hoping that it will not have the same icky, chemical odor.</li>
            <li> This is the second deodorant I&#x27;ve used from LaVanilla- you definitely have to reapply at least once if not twice plus a day.  Smell&#x27;s great.  Overall, I think it works well for a natural d.o.  I tried Toms- it has no smell and burned my skin.  This is expensive-  too expensive but in comparison to Tom&#x27;s it&#x27;s way better!</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a long lasting vegan deodorant that&#x27;s all natural and aluminum free and I think I found it. I have tried MANY different vegan and natural deodorants like Kiss My Face Cumcumber &amp; Green Tee (worked but left an irritating residue under the arms), Bubble &amp; Bee (Delicious smelling, but DID NOT LAST for more than 3 hours and afterwards I would have some serious B.O and was unfortunately in some awkward situations goofing around with guy friends when it \\&quot;wore off\\&quot; x__X. ), Thai Crystal (works fairly well I think, but I realized I wanted a little scent). And then I decided to take a gander and try this stuff out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant at first as the price seems crazy to me for a deodorant. (I&#x27;m used to paying less than $10!) Luckily my mom decided to treat me and was willing to pay for a deodorant I wanted at the Sephora store. I smelled all of the lavnilla deodorants. O_O They ALL smelled like fabric softner out of the jar. STRONG fabric softner. Not really pleasant honestly, rather fumy to the nose. My mom smelled them all and noticed the weird smell too, but we both agreed that the passionfruit smelled the best out of all of them so that&#x27;s what I ended up getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff WORKS GREAT. The smell out of the jar is something else, but under your arm it goes on like smooth cream and melts into a sweet and somewhat fruity scent. One of my guy friends instantly noticed when I had it on and was like \\&quot;What is that sweet smell?\\&quot; I was like \\&quot;Oh, that&#x27;s probably my new deodorant. It smells like fabric softner though (lol)\\&quot; He was like \\&quot;Yeah, but it&#x27;s smells good. :)\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it LASTS. This has been the longest lasting deodorant out of all those I have tried. I can put it on one day, and smell it lingering on me the next day, and the best part, so far, it doesn&#x27;t leave me smelling awful after it wears off like I hear and know some of the Tom&#x27;s of Maine and Bubble &amp; Bee stuff does!!!! The smell in the jar, and also under your arms does start to wear off in general after a few months, but it still works and I guess that&#x27;s a fair trade off for an amazing natural product. I wore this on a HOT day while I worked at a Vegfest and while the scent didn&#x27;t really last(most likely due to a few months after being opened) it seemed to hold off any major B.O. I was so worried that it wouldn&#x27;t hold that i had brought some of it with me to use in case, but I never had to reapply. Phew. I guess it must have worked well because a guy friend also at the vegfest invited me on a mini date afterward and was quite fine getting all close to me &amp;lt;3 It still might be a good idea to have a small sample to reapply just in case though as everyone&#x27;s body is different and different situations call for different B.O fighting measures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am getting that this is the best scent out of all the Lavanilla based on a lot of reviews on all the scents I have looked at. The grapefruit and vanilla seem to come into a close second/third for people, so I may try those after I use this one up just to change things up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the price still....lol crazy to me, but for a natural product that really works I suppose you&#x27;d be asking to pay a little more.does start to wear off in general after a few months, but it still works and I guess that&#x27;s a fair trade off for an amazing natural product.
