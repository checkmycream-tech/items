            <li>Very happy with my purchase!  </li>
            <li>This is one of the best colognes I ever bought my husband.</li>
            <li>I purchased it about 3 or 4 years ago, and I think it&#x27;s the best cologne for under $25 that I&#x27;ve ever found.  </li>
            <li>Awesome.</li>
            <li>It was perfect!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased all the best smell goods--Lacoste, Issey Miyake, Acqua Di Gio, Creed Himalaya and Nautica Voyage, and I must say that Mary Kay&#x27;s Velocity for him holds it&#x27;s own!</li>
            <li>It smells great.</li>
            <li>This is a great cologne and I&#x27;ve received compliments.</li>
            <li>This is great smelling stuff.</li>
            <li>I recommend this cologne to any man that enjoys smelling awesome. :)</li>
            <li>Arrived in perfect timing and I was able to give it as a Christmas gift.</li>
            <li>Or one that smells good to Women??</li>
            <li>but he loved it - yes</li>
            <li>great shipping and a good price are exactly what I got the product was in perfect condition and what I ordered so no complaints here.</li>
            <li>He was very glad to get this</li>
            <li>Still love it!</li>
            <li>I guarantee you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li>Is not too strong and smells great.</li>
            <li>It was the original and smells just as good...</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS SCENT VERY SMOOTH AND NOT TOO OVERPOWERING</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a win-win for the two of us! :)</li>
            <li>Fantastic!  </li>
            <li>My coworkers always give me compliments about this cologne and really love it.</li>
            <li>my all time favorite, love it</li>
            <li>, do you really want a cologne designed by men and smells good to men?</li>
            <li>best of all--I get ENDLESS compliments and inquiries!</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this cologne from a friend who was also a Mary Kay representative.  </li>
            <li>, clean &amp; sweet brings to mind -- RASPBERRY, CITRUS FRUIT, SPRING SEASON, FLOWER GARDEN &amp; LINEN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am glad that he likes it so much.  </li>
            <li>The seller was quick to ship it too.</li>
            <li>[original idea, right?].  </li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t want to say tell anyone the truth because its so special too me, but I end up telling them to blow their minds that its a Mary Kay product for men!</li>
            <li>Its very bold, yet soft.</li>
            <li>If you want to leave a lasting impression on someone or looking for a great gift that keeps giving look no further!</li>
            <li>Many girls have complimented it, including my current girlfriend, and asked me what it was.  </li>
            <li>Checked it out and sure enough it was for men.</li>
            <li>sure enough it was cheaper.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a light smell, with a bold statement, you should definitely give this one a shot!</li>
            <li>Ordered for my dad and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much I would like it.  </li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>He really likes it.</li>
            <li>It has a very youthful and vibrant scent that pleases the missus (and everyone else).  </li>
            <li>Considering the price, I think it&#x27;s a fairly decent cologne.</li>
            <li>Used to buy this all the time in high school.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have never had one complaint wearing this item, it is amazing.</li>
            <li>I purchased this cologne for my husband because he wore it a few years back and liked the scent; however, he seems to have outgrown it and no longer appreciates the youthful fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Very soft yet noticeable fragrance...and</li>
            <li>old</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my 14 year old son, a friend of his had it and</li>
            <li>AND I had chosen the normal standard shipping.</li>
            <li>you will have to apply a few more layers&lt;br /&gt;than other colognes, consequently having to</li>

            <li> It also lasted for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Once this bottle Empty&#x27;s, you can bet I&#x27;ll buy it again from the same retailer.</li>

            <li> Used to buy this all the time in high school. Still love it! A must buy.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS SCENT VERY SMOOTH AND NOT TOO OVERPOWERING</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase!  It was a gift to my Father for Father&#x27;s Day.  No complaints at all.  Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best colognes I ever bought my husband. It smells great.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my dad and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> this is a cologne that you can use when going out. i would only use it when going to workout or playing basketball. Not a great cologne to buy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne for my husband because he wore it a few years back and liked the scent; however, he seems to have outgrown it and no longer appreciates the youthful fragrance.  Considering the price, I think it&#x27;s a fairly decent cologne.</li>
            <li> Ordered two bottles of cologne, received one after 6 weeks and was charged for two. The one bottle of cologne we received was outdated.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this cologne from a friend who was also a Mary Kay representative.  I didn&#x27;t realize how much I would like it.  My husband was running low on the bottle.  The glass bottle is durable, as it was dropped on a ceramic tile floor and remained in one piece.  It also lasted for a long time.  Nonetheless, since his supply was dwindling, I got this for him for Father&#x27;s Day [original idea, right?].  He was very glad to get this and I am glad that he likes it so much.  It&#x27;s a win-win for the two of us! :)</li>
            <li> i only wish it lasted longer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SMELL -&lt;br /&gt;Fresh, clean &amp; sweet brings to mind -- RASPBERRY, CITRUS FRUIT, SPRING SEASON, FLOWER GARDEN &amp; LINEN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LONGEVITY -&lt;br /&gt;radiates within arm length for 2-3 hours only</li>
            <li> I have been using this cologne for like a year now. I wear it everyday and everyone loves it. They always think i am wearing something super expensive like Yves Saint Laurent. I have never had one complaint wearing this item, it is amazing. I recommend this cologne to any man that enjoys smelling awesome. :)</li>
            <li> This cologne smells terrific, and it lasts a long time.  Two sprays and you can smell it on you/your clothes the next day.  I purchased it about 3 or 4 years ago, and I think it&#x27;s the best cologne for under $25 that I&#x27;ve ever found.  Many girls have complimented it, including my current girlfriend, and asked me what it was.  Obviously, they are fairly shocked that it&#x27;s a Mary Kay men&#x27;s product.  Go for it.</li>
            <li> I had smelled this on one of my co-workers and asked him what he was wearing. I asked for the name and he said velocity by Mary Kay. Automatically I thought its a perfume not a cologne and he told me it was for men. Checked it out and sure enough it was for men. I was gonna buy it at Macy&#x27;s but saw how pricy it was and figured I&#x27;d check it out at amazon and sure enough it was cheaper. $10 cheaper. The seller was quick to ship it too. Ordered it Friday in Cali and received it Monday from Mississippi. AND I had chosen the normal standard shipping. Once this bottle Empty&#x27;s, you can bet I&#x27;ll buy it again from the same retailer.</li>
            <li> ACTUALLY, MY HUSBAND LOVES IT.  THANKS</li>
            <li> It was ordered Sunday 17 December 2012 and it came in Wednesday 19 December 2012.  Fantastic!  Especially when I have growing son&#x27;s in my home. Awesome.</li>
            <li> great shipping and a good price are exactly what I got the product was in perfect condition and what I ordered so no complaints here.</li>
            <li> Product was as expected and came on time.</li>
            <li> This is a cologne designed by women for men... So read that again but slowly this time... Key Word &#x3D; DESIGNED - BY - WOMEN&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys, do you really want a cologne designed by men and smells good to men? Or one that smells good to Women?? Think about it..</li>
            <li> This is my every day go to cologne.  Is not too strong and smells great.</li>
            <li> been using it since i was about 16 yrs. old now i&#x27;m 30 and still use it every day la</li>
            <li> he just finished the bottle today so i have to get him another one but he loved it - yes</li>
            <li> i have been looking for this bottle for a long time since im not with my friend that worked for Mary Kay i didnt know where to get this... It was the original and smells just as good...</li>
            <li> Ive been using this cologne for about 8 years and I call it my signature scent! Its very bold, yet soft. I call it my signature scent because its the only cologne I will wear and everyone knows its me when I pass by. Ive had countless inquiries on what it was and I really don&#x27;t want to say tell anyone the truth because its so special too me, but I end up telling them to blow their minds that its a Mary Kay product for men! If you want to leave a lasting impression on someone or looking for a great gift that keeps giving look no further!</li>
            <li> Not sure what I got but it&#x27;s not velocity cologne</li>
            <li> This is a great cologne and I&#x27;ve received compliments.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 14 year old son, a friend of his had it and my son wanted some too.  He really likes it.</li>
            <li> It was perfect! Arrived in perfect timing and I was able to give it as a Christmas gift. I would purchase from here in the future.</li>
            <li> My coworkers always give me compliments about this cologne and really love it. If you don&#x27;t believe me, give it a try and see by yourself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased all the best smell goods--Lacoste, Issey Miyake, Acqua Di Gio, Creed Himalaya and Nautica Voyage, and I must say that Mary Kay&#x27;s Velocity for him holds it&#x27;s own! Very soft yet noticeable fragrance...and best of all--I get ENDLESS compliments and inquiries! If you&#x27;re looking for a light smell, with a bold statement, you should definitely give this one a shot! I guarantee you&#x27;ll love it! I&#x27;ve been a fan of this fragrance for well over 5 years!</li>
            <li> Velocity has an alluring scent like no other.&lt;br /&gt;It is one of freshness and slight provocation.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s subtlety is both a pro &amp; con,&lt;br /&gt;by which it isn&#x27;t aggressive or overpowering,&lt;br /&gt;which tends to be offensive yet for the same&lt;br /&gt;reason you will have to apply a few more layers&lt;br /&gt;than other colognes, consequently having to&lt;br /&gt;restock quicker.</li>
            <li> This is great smelling stuff. My husband has used this stuff as well as the men&#x27;s Tribute from Mary Kay</li>
            <li> my all time favorite, love it</li>
            <li> I have family members that have sold Mary Kay products in the past so I had worn this scent before, but it is just as alluring as I remember.  It has a very youthful and vibrant scent that pleases the missus (and everyone else).  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Cologne is in glass container with heavy glass bottom.  Bottom was chipped and very dangerous If not handled carefully, cuts hand.</li>
