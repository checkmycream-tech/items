            <li>First off I love the smell!!</li>
            <li>I love Philosophy products, and I purchased this set for a friend for her birthday.</li>
            <li>this product is ok but the shower gel/shampoo does not lather well and for 36 bucks would expect a better product.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased I purchased this set.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased at the size of the bottles--</li>
            <li>I love this fragance</li>
            <li>It has travel size versions of 4 products and I love them all.</li>
            <li>I love it, I love the way the Shampoo/Bath, Body wash feels on my Hair and skin, the scent is AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I give the entire line a 3 star, again I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed considering the price.</li>
            <li>I love their product</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that the firming cream firmed anything, but I love it.</li>
            <li>We both love Philosophy products</li>
            <li>Try this fragrance, you will love it and others will too.  </li>
            <li>Very fast shipping, I received it within 3 days of ordering it, comes with everything it says it will in brand new condition, the smell is delicious.</li>
            <li>The lotion goes on well, not too greasy but pleasant, the conditioner works great and works well on my baby&#x27;s fine hair, the bath gel is just like any other, the bath salts are okay nothing to rant about.  </li>
            <li>Soon after receiving it she let me know how much she loved it and</li>
            <li>This is a very light clean scent.</li>
            <li>I bought this kit and was pleasantly surprised to the packaging it came in, very nice, the scent wasn&#x27;t as heavenly as I was hoping</li>
            <li>Very clean and light smelling...</li>
            <li>Way too strong.</li>
            <li>and I smelled this beautiful scent and realized it had lingered even there after several days!</li>
            <li>I wish more fragrances made full body care lines like this.</li>
            <li>Also, the bag is super cute.</li>
            <li>Amazing Grace is a floral, yet crisp and clean smell.</li>
            <li>I love the fresh, clean scent with just a hint of flowers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very clean, fresh scent that is not too overpowering, flowery or fruity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>I wanted to try the salt scrub, but did not want to buy the full size version</li>
            <li>The smell is fresh, clean and feminine.  </li>
            <li>This a scent people won&#x27;t catch unless they&#x27;re next to you, and isn&#x27;t that nice?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have products that go with with your perfume instead of clashing with it, plus layering them with the perfume makes the fragrance last longer.</li>
            <li>4 piece pampering gift set was a fantastic way to try a new product line without the expense of purchasing full size bottles.  </li>
            <li>I love all of the Philosophy body washes because they are not irritating to my sensitive skin and are non drying.  </li>
            <li>I loved the little carrying case and the idea of giving a sample of products she could use.</li>
            <li>I love shopping at Amazon and give a big thumbs up on Philosophy...:D</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I ordered this to be at her home after running her first marathon ever.</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy more gifts from philosophy.</li>
            <li>for- floral but very soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>The different products that were in the package were such a good combination.</li>
            <li>The Conditioner makes my hair feels so soft and sweetly</li>
            <li>You really do get a whole lot of product in this purchase.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t lather really well, making me use a lot.  </li>
            <li>They also lather really well every time.  </li>
            <li>It left me smooth and helped make me feel luxurious in the shower along with the matching body wash.  </li>
            <li>The bottles are kind of small, which I didn&#x27;t realize because I didn&#x27;t read the description very closely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just not nearly as subtle as I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these items.</li>
            <li>The little case it comes in it adorable.  </li>
            <li>This was very first time using this product, and the fragrance in Philosophy are very soft and not over powering smells like soap when I was little, thank you philosophy I have even bought the Philosophy solid perfume which I love also...</li>
            <li>&quot; There&#x27;s nothing heavy or overwhelming about it.</li>
            <li>, it is light, delicate and very feminine.  </li>
            <li>After several hours you don&#x27;t really notice that you have perfume on</li>
            <li>however, I just personally didn&#x27;t care for the scent all that much.</li>
            <li>But I just feel like an old lady with this scent on.</li>
            <li>My husband surprised me with this gift set</li>
            <li>For the money, you are actually getting a decent amount of product, which I was surprised by.</li>
            <li>It is a subtle but refreshing fragrance.</li>
            <li>The scent to me personally was that of someone older, geriatic.  </li>
            <li>Not to big but certainly not to small.</li>
            <li>I save my stuff for special occasions, but could definately use this everyday!</li>
            <li>She actually tried to purchase some of these products direct from philosophy and they were out of stock but AMAZON had them.</li>

            <li> Just what one needs in Cold Climates (ok so Ky is not usually this cold , but...)</li>
            <li> usually you get these tiny little 1.7 oz.</li>
            <li> Also the fragrance changes once it dries down,</li>
            <li> A little something for everyone, if you will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You get a sample of all the different products but don&#x27;t pay the expensive price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller than i thought and a bit expensive, for me</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and the shampoo</li>
            <li> I WANTED to like this so bad.  </li>

            <li> This is a very light clean scent. Anyone purchasing this needs to know that up front. This a scent people won&#x27;t catch unless they&#x27;re next to you, and isn&#x27;t that nice? Also the fragrance changes once it dries down, so be patient. It&#x27;s worth it! Oh yeah, I bought this set for myself and it&#x27;s adorable!</li>
            <li> I love Philosophy products, and I purchased this set for a friend for her birthday. Amazing Grace is probably my favorite scent from the company, and I myself have the perfume. It&#x27;s a very clean, fresh scent that is not too overpowering, flowery or fruity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set comes with four items and all are packaged in a small white bag. For the money, you are actually getting a decent amount of product, which I was surprised by. I also like the variety of products in the set. A little something for everyone, if you will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is perfect for a gift and my friend was happy to receive it.</li>
            <li> this product is ok but the shower gel/shampoo does not lather well and for 36 bucks would expect a better product.  The exfoliating scrub was a plus though.</li>
            <li> You really do get a whole lot of product in this purchase.  Also it smells really nice.  One of my mom&#x27;s favorite parts about it though, was all the wonderful quotes and saying on the bottles&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I am pleased I purchased this set.  I was pleased at the size of the bottles-- usually you get these tiny little 1.7 oz. things but these were twice that!  I also bought the perfumed oil and the combination was just what I was looking for- floral but very soft and clean.  After several hours you don&#x27;t really notice that you have perfume on but it definitely is-- I put on a sweater I had on while I had been wearing it and I smelled this beautiful scent and realized it had lingered even there after several days!</li>
            <li> If you (or someone you know) loves Philosophy&#x27;s Amazing Grace perfume, this is a wonderful product. I bought it for my mother, who wears Amazing Grace, and she loved it. The set contains a body scrub, conditioner, body wash/shampoo, and a \\&quot;body firming emulsion\\&quot; aka lotion. The bottles are kind of small, which I didn&#x27;t realize because I didn&#x27;t read the description very closely. The little case it comes in it adorable.  I wish more fragrances made full body care lines like this. It&#x27;s nice to have products that go with with your perfume instead of clashing with it, plus layering them with the perfume makes the fragrance last longer. Amazing Grace is a very, very light scent. I&#x27;ve heard it described as \\&quot;perfume for people who don&#x27;t like perfume.\\&quot; There&#x27;s nothing heavy or overwhelming about it. Very light and airy. Great purchase. I&#x27;m happy and so is my mom!</li>
            <li> Philosophy Amazing Grace 4 piece pampering gift set was a fantastic way to try a new product line without the expense of purchasing full size bottles.  I love this fragance, it is light, delicate and very feminine.  The scent lasts all day.  I would highly recommend these items.</li>
            <li> I love this scent and am really happy to have purchased it. It is a subtle but refreshing fragrance. The different products that were in the package were such a good combination. The size of each bottle was perfect. Not to big but certainly not to small. For anyone who likes the Amazing Grace scent should try this product. You get a sample of all the different products but don&#x27;t pay the expensive price.</li>
            <li> This was very first time using this product, and the fragrance in Philosophy are very soft and not over powering smells like soap when I was little, thank you philosophy I have even bought the Philosophy solid perfume which I love also...I love shopping at Amazon and give a big thumbs up on Philosophy...:D happy girl and smelling great.  [[ASIN:B000EMW88G Philosophy Grace Gift Set (4-Piece)]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used almost every Amazing Grace product there is because I love the scent.  I wanted to try the salt scrub, but did not want to buy the full size version so this was the perfect set for me.  It has travel size versions of 4 products and I love them all.</li>
            <li> but it was the perfect gift for my mother whose name is Grace :) she really enjoyed it.  It&#x27;s smaller than i thought and a bit expensive, for me at least but it was worth it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my best friend for Christmas and she LOVED it. She actually tried to purchase some of these products direct from philosophy and they were out of stock but AMAZON had them. And it arrived before christmas as promised</li>
            <li> This Product is aptly named. I love it, I love the way the Shampoo/Bath, Body wash feels on my Hair and skin, the scent is AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The Conditioner makes my hair feels so soft and sweetly scented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  And the Salt Scrub!!! Just what one needs in Cold Climates (ok so Ky is not usually this cold , but...) it sloughs off the dry spots and smoothes them out and leaves that shinny silky look all over (especially on the legs) that women like and men go Gaga for!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this kit and was pleasantly surprised to the packaging it came in, very nice, the scent wasn&#x27;t as heavenly as I was hoping but the products are pleasant, nothing extravagant.  The scent to me personally was that of someone older, geriatic.  The lotion goes on well, not too greasy but pleasant, the conditioner works great and works well on my baby&#x27;s fine hair, the bath gel is just like any other, the bath salts are okay nothing to rant about.  I like the products however, I just personally didn&#x27;t care for the scent all that much. I give the entire line a 3 star, again I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed considering the price.</li>
            <li> I love their product so I think this made a nice gift , and also good for anyone who would like to try this out .</li>
            <li> This is one of Philosophy&#x27;s best products?  It smells amazing and leaves your skin and hair feeling fantastic!  Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> Excellent fragrance! Amazing Grace is a floral, yet crisp and clean smell. All of the products are wonderful and highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I WANTED to like this so bad.  But I just feel like an old lady with this scent on. It&#x27;s just not nearly as subtle as I thought it would be.  Way too strong.</li>
            <li> First off I love the smell!! Everyone comments on it &amp; it lasts!  I have thick hair and the shampoo didn&#x27;t lather really well, making me use a lot.  The conditioner was awesome.  I don&#x27;t know that the firming cream firmed anything, but I love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother on Mothers day!! She loved it sooooo much!!!! I love philosophy, and my momma does too!! ;) very pleased!!</li>
            <li> We purchased this for my Mother-in-law for her birthday. She loves it! Says it smells great. Great buy! We both love Philosophy products</li>
            <li> My husband surprised me with this gift set and I give it \\&quot;two thumbs up\\&quot;.  Philosophy products are one of my favorites and this is a nice package.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!! Try this fragrance, you will love it and others will too.  Very clean and light smelling...Great product.  Thank you Philosophy!!</li>
            <li> My daughter-in-law, mother of four children...two teenagers and two \\&quot;kids\\&quot; 5 and 3, decided to get herself back in shape and worked like a dog doing it. I ordered this to be at her home after running her first marathon ever. The girl needed to take time to pamper herself. She loves this kit. Great job, Seller!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a good friend for her birthday. I loved the little carrying case and the idea of giving a sample of products she could use. Soon after receiving it she let me know how much she loved it and how good it smelled. I would definitely buy more gifts from philosophy.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly suprised when I received this gift set.  The bottles are much larger than I had anticipated.  Also, the bag is super cute.</li>
            <li> This Amazing Grace set smells amazing! I love the fresh, clean scent with just a hint of flowers. I save my stuff for special occasions, but could definately use this everyday!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a shower gift for the mom-to-be and she absolutely loved it. Philosophy did a great job arranging this gift bag.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to experience the Amazing Grace line by Philosophy.  The smell is fresh, clean and feminine.  I love all of the Philosophy body washes because they are not irritating to my sensitive skin and are non drying.  They also lather really well every time.  The lotion glides on, absorbs fast and smells excellent.  The scent actually lasts a long time too.  The salt scrub was a treat.  It left me smooth and helped make me feel luxurious in the shower along with the matching body wash.  This was a wonderful set.  I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping, I received it within 3 days of ordering it, comes with everything it says it will in brand new condition, the smell is delicious. Great to give as a gift!</li>
