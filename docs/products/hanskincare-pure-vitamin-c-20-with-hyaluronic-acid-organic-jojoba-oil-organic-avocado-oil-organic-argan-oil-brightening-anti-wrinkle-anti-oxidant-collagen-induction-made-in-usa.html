            <li>The texture in my skin looks healthy and brighter.</li>
            <li>I love this magic  vitamin c serum</li>
            <li>I was concerned about the oil content and product giving my oily skin a greasy surface and not being able to wear it under foundation or mineral powder.</li>

            <li>I LOVE this Pure Vitamin C 20% serum!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>and I was able to notice my skin becoming brighten and fresh.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face and hands and it makes my skin smooth and has almost eliminated age spots on my hand.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous product.  </li>
            <li>this one so far, has been my favorite!  </li>
            <li>However the efficacy of Pure vitamin c with ascorbic acid is much more efficacious than the one with vitamin C derivative.</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that this product doesn&#x27;t have much chemicals.</li>
            <li>so fresh- highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li>Love using this amazingly potent serum on my clients for brightening and overall nourishment.  </li>
            <li>The result comes out so quick</li>
            <li>I love my new vitamin c 20% .MY</li>
            <li>it was completely absorbed into my skin...</li>
            <li>RIGHT</li>
            <li>Whenever my skin is feeling like it needs a bit of TLC, this serum gives my skin an extra boost to look healthy.</li>
            <li>Love the fact it has essential oils.</li>
            <li>I recently tried this product and I am in love.</li>
            <li>My skin is noticeably softer and smoother and was immediately after I used it the first time.  </li>
            <li>I am an esthetician and have tried many different brands of vitamin C.  </li>
            <li>I am a loyal customer of this product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>However, not only has my skin not broken out, it looks better than ever before.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to any and everyone for healthy skin care....but especially the male and female baby boomers who need some tender loving skin care.</li>
            <li>I have used various types of Vitamin C serum of which I like this product as one of the best, so am writing my 1st time review/comment and to verify, also called the manufacturer regarding the above and checked % of TEA and other ingredients although not all the ingredients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hooked on this Pure Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>Was also purchased with Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum.</li>
            <li>I use less mousturizer now because it does such a great job providing moisture for my skin.</li>
            <li>Think about how much of vitamin C derivative can be converted into pure vitamin C, Ascorbic acid..</li>
            <li>I can tell a big difference in the texture and brightness of my skin in just a short time and my skin feels amazing.</li>
            <li>And it was absorbing well into my face/skin.</li>
            <li>How much of Retinyl Palmitate will/can be converted into Retin-A. Very trivial amount...</li>
            <li>I really feel as though the product makes my skin look brighter.</li>
            <li>At first I was nervous because whenever I try a new product I fear it will make my skin breakout.</li>
            <li>If this is absolutely true regardless of TEA% or paraben%, then very known company like Estee Lauder(for instance, Advanced Night Repair Synchronized Recovery Complex II), Shiseido (for instance, Skin Glow Enhancing Primer SPF 15), so many global cosmetic companies should stop some of their product lines containing this ingredient.</li>
            <li>and I am surprised by how much it has helped!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I WOULD HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>I am very cautious and selective about what I put on my face and always trying to use natural, organic ingredients</li>
            <li>When it comes to Vitamin C, pure vitamin c, it should be in the form of Ascorbic acid only to be most efficacious which is so sensitive to heat, light and air differently from other vitamin C serum with vitamin C derivatives such as MAP, Calcium Ascorbate, etc.</li>
            <li>So in general and therefore with % less than 0.05% of TEA, should be safe which I check with the supplier and manufacturer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several other brands of vitamin c serum and my own attempt to DIY.....and didn&#x27;t see any change after several months of usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the ingredients of Hanskincare C20 serum</li>
            <li>More specifically some major Vitamin C serum sold in amazon, that is made of Vitamin C derivative mainly, so stable with time but for the efficacy, as I have used several so far for the past 1 month, not even close to the efficacy of pure vitamin c made of Ascorbic acid...</li>
            <li>I am in my late 50s and have spent a lifetime in the sun (many times without adequate protection, if any at all.  </li>
            <li>so I use make up a lot daily and this serum really helps softenes my skin as it tightens it, makes it easier to apply make up.</li>
            <li>I suffer with hyper pigmentation and some adult acne scars.</li>
            <li>I feel much more rejuvenated after only a few days for use.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this product for a few days and have noticed a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>The bottom line is that it&#x27;s safe, not toxic with % less than 0.05%, works as pH adjuster since ascorbic acid brings down</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to soon completely get rid of the dark eye circles by diligently using this serum every night.</li>
            <li> Really good price for the product also compared to other brands that are either very expensive or don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> After only using it for a few weeks I&#x27;ve notice it has helped vanish acne scars much faster than any other product I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> However as long as TEA % in the formulation is less than 0.05%, it won&#x27;t affect the skin as generally thought and known like Paraben kinds of ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 50+ year old women in need of help with revitalizing my skin from several years of negative affects of sun exposure.</li>
            <li> It has stayed softer and I am not that diligent about using it every single day...  </li>
            <li> I used it for 4-days and woke up to skin peeling and rough patches (skin preparing to flack).</li>
            <li> I wanted to get a product for my dark circles and changing skin because I noticed a gradual difference in my appearance after years of makeup and long nights working</li>
            <li> I used endless cream and essence, but it did not give me satisfaction.</li>
            <li> A few of the other ingredients should be looked into before you purchase.   </li>
            <li> I also have been sun-tanning which created uneven tone and dark spots</li>
            <li> I do feel that it dries out my skin a little</li>
            <li> ITS SOFTER, BRIGHTER, AND DEAD SKIN SPOTS THAT</li>
            <li> However, this vitamin was what I have been missing.</li>
            <li> I also massaged it around my eyes as I had bad dark eye circles lately due to bad sleep habits and my problem is getting better.</li>
            <li> TEA is not a safe ingredient.  </li>
            <li> Works wonders bringing back life to dull complexion!!!!</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Both my mother and I have tried this product and we fully recommend it. Whenever my skin is feeling like it needs a bit of TLC, this serum gives my skin an extra boost to look healthy. My mom says it makes her skin feel tighter and younger as well. Really good price for the product also compared to other brands that are either very expensive or don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I love my new vitamin c 20% .MY skin feels  like a baby .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for Two months. My skin looks and feels great. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this Pure Vitamin C 20% serum!! I&#x27;m an Esthetician and have used a lot of different C serums on my clients and this by far is the best! My skin is smoother and brighter and my pores are tighter! I also use it under my eyes!  I know this will be a favorite with my clients, too!!</li>
            <li> I love this.  Have only been using for almost 2 weeks but already notice a difference in my skin.  I use it on my face and hands and it makes my skin smooth and has almost eliminated age spots on my hand.  You cannot go wrong with this!!!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a few days and have noticed a huge difference in my skin. My skin is brighter, tighter and all the redness has evened out dramatically. People have been giving me more compliments on my skin since using this. I do feel that it dries out my skin a little but I just wear it under my moisturizer and it&#x27;s fine. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Tried another brand of vitamin c and liked it but this brand is mynecklace favorite. Love the fact it has essential oils. Workings great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked on this Pure Vitamin C serum. I love it! I love how smooth my skin feels and protects me from sun damage.  The texture in my skin looks healthy and brighter. I am a loyal customer of this product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> After only using it for a few weeks I&#x27;ve notice it has helped vanish acne scars much faster than any other product I&#x27;ve used before. Was also purchased with Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum. Very happy with both products and its results. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I recently tried this product and I am in love. I could see the visible difference in my skin the next day. It even made me feel so different when applying it. It absorbs into skin so well like the rain in the desert. I am very cautious and selective about what I put on my face and always trying to use natural, organic ingredients and I love the fact that this product doesn&#x27;t have much chemicals. I also have been sun-tanning which created uneven tone and dark spots but this also seem to even out the tone. I am a stage performer so I use make up a lot daily and this serum really helps softenes my skin as it tightens it, makes it easier to apply make up. I love this magic  vitamin c serum and I will def tell my friends about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 50+ year old women in need of help with revitalizing my skin from several years of negative affects of sun exposure. I suffer with hyper pigmentation and some adult acne scars. I&#x27;ve tried several other brands of vitamin c serum and my own attempt to DIY.....and didn&#x27;t see any change after several months of usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the ingredients of Hanskincare C20 serum I was concerned about the oil content and product giving my oily skin a greasy surface and not being able to wear it under foundation or mineral powder. This product is a perfect balance of oils and vitamin C concentration. Five (5) minutes after application to face/neck area it was completely absorbed into my skin...my skin had mat texture...perfect surface for sunscreen and foundation. I simply love this product! I used it for 4-days and woke up to skin peeling and rough patches (skin preparing to flack). This result is my skin reacting to a wonderful formula to encourage collagen production, brighten skin tone and to stimulate cellular renewal. Both thumps up to Hanskincare!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could give this product six (6) stars I would.  I recommend this product to any and everyone for healthy skin care....but especially the male and female baby boomers who need some tender loving skin care.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product.  Literally drops on my fingers cover my entire face, neck and chest area.  Probably a total of 20-30 drops.  I am in my late 50s and have spent a lifetime in the sun (many times without adequate protection, if any at all.  My skin has sun damage and this product is magical.  My skin is noticeably softer and smoother and was immediately after I used it the first time.  It has stayed softer and I am not that diligent about using it every single day...  I love this and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> TEA is not a safe ingredient.  Look it up.  A few of the other ingredients should be looked into before you purchase.   SMELLS RANCID Good luck</li>
            <li> I tried another Vitamin C serum before and didn&#x27;t like the sticky feel. But this serum does not have that issue. And it was absorbing well into my face/skin. I feel much more rejuvenated after only a few days for use. I also massaged it around my eyes as I had bad dark eye circles lately due to bad sleep habits and my problem is getting better. I&#x27;m looking forward to soon completely get rid of the dark eye circles by diligently using this serum every night.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get a product for my dark circles and changing skin because I noticed a gradual difference in my appearance after years of makeup and long nights working/studying. My friend recommended this product to me and I&#x27;ve been applying it regularly for a couple weeks and I am surprised by how much it has helped!</li>
            <li> Just throwing in my 2 cents..I have used various types of Vitamin C serum of which I like this product as one of the best, so am writing my 1st time review/comment and to verify, also called the manufacturer regarding the above and checked % of TEA and other ingredients although not all the ingredients. The bottom line is that it&#x27;s safe, not toxic with % less than 0.05%, works as pH adjuster since ascorbic acid brings down pH below 2 which needs to be brought above pH level 3. When it comes to Vitamin C, pure vitamin c, it should be in the form of Ascorbic acid only to be most efficacious which is so sensitive to heat, light and air differently from other vitamin C serum with vitamin C derivatives such as MAP, Calcium Ascorbate, etc. However the efficacy of Pure vitamin c with ascorbic acid is much more efficacious than the one with vitamin C derivative. Think about how much of vitamin C derivative can be converted into pure vitamin C, Ascorbic acid..The same thing applies to Retin-A V.S. Retinyl Palmitate in Vitamin A. How much of Retinyl Palmitate will/can be converted into Retin-A. Very trivial amount...More specifically some major Vitamin C serum sold in amazon, that is made of Vitamin C derivative mainly, so stable with time but for the efficacy, as I have used several so far for the past 1 month, not even close to the efficacy of pure vitamin c made of Ascorbic acid...You may have some emotional satisfaction by the fact that the color doesn&#x27;t get changed with time. As a pH adjuster TEA can be also utilized despite some possibility that it may not be good for the skin. However as long as TEA % in the formulation is less than 0.05%, it won&#x27;t affect the skin as generally thought and known like Paraben kinds of ingredients. If this is absolutely true regardless of TEA% or paraben%, then very known company like Estee Lauder(for instance, Advanced Night Repair Synchronized Recovery Complex II), Shiseido (for instance, Skin Glow Enhancing Primer SPF 15), so many global cosmetic companies should stop some of their product lines containing this ingredient. So in general and therefore with % less than 0.05% of TEA, should be safe which I check with the supplier and manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Love using this amazingly potent serum on my clients for brightening and overall nourishment.  Works wonders bringing back life to dull complexion!!!! I&#x27;ve used brands like skinceuticals ,Obagi and lauder- this product is such a find and so fresh- highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> BEEN USING  THE C20 FOR A SHORT TIME AND I CANT BELIEVE MY SKIN. ITS SOFTER, BRIGHTER, AND DEAD SKIN SPOTS THAT NOTHING ELSE TOOK AWAY ARE GONE. THE SERUM IS NOT GREASY OR OILY, MY SKIN DRINKS IT RIGHT IN LIKE ITS DYING OF THIRST.... I WOULD HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SERUM TO ANYONE. I WONT USE ANYTHING ELSE EVER AGAIN.....❤</li>
            <li> I am an esthetician and have tried many different brands of vitamin C.  I have been using this product on clients, as well as myself for a couple of weeks now and must say, this one so far, has been my favorite!  I can tell a big difference in the texture and brightness of my skin in just a short time and my skin feels amazing.</li>
            <li> Love it. My face looks brighter and feels better with the exfoliation the serum provides. I used to rub lemon slices on my face but the serum does much better for my skin</li>
            <li> This is a &amp;#34;MUST&amp;#34; item for all ladies. The result comes out so quick and it is easy to use. I just use it every night before I sleep and I was able to notice my skin becoming brighten and fresh. I love this Vitamin. I used endless cream and essence, but it did not give me satisfaction. However, this vitamin was what I have been missing. My friend immediately noticed my skin became brighten, clean, soft, and nice!! I recommended all of my friends to use this Serum to have a goooooooood skin like me!!</li>
            <li> I have been using the C20 product for about 2 weeks now and I&#x27;m loving it. At first I was nervous because whenever I try a new product I fear it will make my skin breakout. However, not only has my skin not broken out, it looks better than ever before. I really feel as though the product makes my skin look brighter. I use less mousturizer now because it does such a great job providing moisture for my skin. I love the way it feels when I put it on before my makeup. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
