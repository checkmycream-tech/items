    <ol>
            <li>It is so awesome to have another item in my pain management tool box that doesn&#x27;t involve a pill that must circulate systematically through my body when in reality,  and Magnesium spray would be the best solution.  </li>

            <li>From reading the product info and reviews some people experienced itching, but I did not, perhaps because mine was enriched with Aloe Vera.  </li>

            <li>This is perfect for me as I love to exercise</li>
            <li>It seems to smell pleasant.  </li>
            <li>It does tingle when you apply it...not a pleasant tingling sensation, but a borderline burning sensation.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and best part is the customer service from the company that sells it.  </li>
            <li>Then it feels good, and seems to be good for your skin.  </li>
            <li>I did not have the dreaded itchy reaction, so that was good.</li>
            <li>I took that to be a good thing and used nothing else in this</li>
            <li>A good way to get your magnesium for those of us who need to supplement but get digestive issues if we take the pills.</li>
            <li>Seams to work prity good</li>
            <li>Regardless of what one may use it for, I believe it is a good way to get added magnesium.</li>
            <li>It feels good on my skin and helps me relax.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>When I was told it was really good and</li>
            <li>Really good investment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good product, just not noticing anything from using it.</li>
            <li>I have had legs cramps for years that have kept me from having a good night&#x27;s sleep almost every night.  </li>

            <li>Amazing product</li>
            <li>An Amazing Product.  </li>
            <li>Seven Minerals gave me a free sample of magnesium oil with aloe vera to try, and I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s a great solution.  </li>
            <li>It is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Just my own experience -</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good product getting more accustom to your skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not so much itchy as buzzy (best word for me).</li>
            <li>/&gt;The absolute best part is this.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;The seller sent a nice email before the product came with additional information on how to use it.</li>
            <li>It is a nice oil.  </li>
            <li>Just as suggested by Sircus and many others, the foot soak with magnesium is a good thing to do at night to promote restful sleep.  </li>
            <li>Nice product, I use it every day after I shower.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to mix my own.</li>
            <li>can say I am using it and loving it..</li>
            <li>Given To Me For An Honest Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Magnesium Oil with Aloe Vera by Seven Minerals</li>
            <li>If it works for you, great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample to test and provide an honest opinion.  </li>
            <li>Really liked it.  </li>
            <li>but getting more magnesium into my system while I&#x27;m healing is a good thing.</li>
            <li>I thought mauve it wasn&#x27;t as effective,  </li>
            <li>I have been using Magnesium oil for over a month now, and I am loving it.</li>
            <li>I decided to purchase my own &amp; went with Seven Minerals with aloe Vera.  </li>

            <li>believe this is a convenient and effective way to add magnesium to your body, and people with more severe cramping issues could find some relief from it.</li>

            <li>However, mine was delivered without the top.</li>
            <li>She loves this stuff now and is convinced it worked as well as or better than the Epsom</li>
            <li>I apply in the morning, put my socks on, go to work ( I am a nurse) and my feet feel so much better.</li>
            <li>As it&#x27;s itching, I find myself rubbing it in more.  </li>
            <li>I like it best when used on areas that don&#x27;t rub together, so use on outside of  arms, front of legs, stomach, buttocks,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to put a lot more weight on my knee and walk with the cane just as a balance aide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And there are more.  </li>
            <li>Oil comes in a twelve ounce plastic bottle with a spray top.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased to have received this product and will continue using it.  </li>
            <li>ok, but makes my skin itch</li>
            <li>I have already written a review on how great magnesium with aloe vera really works, now to extend my comment</li>
            <li>and I feel more relaxed.  </li>

            <li>love this -</li>
            <li>but I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I purchased this product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Magnesium in all its forms</li>
            <li>The aloe vera added takes away most of the itchiness and makes the spray more moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I feel better, more balanced and energized than I did before using it.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve any questions, the customer service department is on top of everything</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m out real quick.</li>
            <li>love the addition of aloe to it...</li>
            <li>I find I sleep better since using this product.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I learned about Magnesium Oil reading a book on how to sleep better.  </li>
            <li>I plan to buy more.</li>
            <li>This product is okay.</li>
            <li>Interesting product.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully better muscle and heart health results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than I could have imagined.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic for muscle cramps, bruises and tension headaches!</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>I feel better after rubbing it on</li>
            <li>All I can say is I love it...</li>
            <li>No need to take oral drug any more.</li>
            <li>Seems to have cured these two problems :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this product, thanks</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and will continue to use it faithfully.  </li>
            <li>but sure wish I could give it many, many more.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I wasn&#x27;t too sure about this magnesium oil, I have never used it before but wanted to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I will continue using this to see if we notice any more health improvements.</li>
            <li>We tried it in many scenarios and for us ... did not seem to provide visible or tangible benefit.</li>
            <li>one more thing:</li>
            <li>This has been interesting to use.</li>
            <li>Great product that has really helped decrease migraine frequency.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure this was what was helping.</li>
            <li>After taking the liquid, ionic magnesium I was impressed with the instant results (in some ways).</li>
            <li>but my mood is better.</li>
            <li>My wife has many allergies (including ALL corn products, i.e. corn starch, etc).</li>
            <li>Most pills use a corn starch binder.</li>
            <li>Any magnesium that goes through her digestive system causes many problems.</li>
            <li>The bottle has a spray nozzle on top.</li>
            <li>Then I do the foot bath more often.</li>
            <li>As a result, I&#x27;m feeling much more rested in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>(A better spray pattern could be used on a vertical</li>
            <li>(A better spray pattern could be used on a vertical</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m finding that I&#x27;m moving much better.</li>
            <li>I bought some for my brother-in-law and this magnesium oil has helped his shoulder move much better.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this to see if it gets better with time.</li>
            <li>There are many reason to use magnesium.</li>
            <li>The Seven Minerals w/o aloe may be a better product.</li>
            <li>When product was delivered, it had a piece of tape on top of bottle, appearing to hold the cap on.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m okay with this).  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice the itching some reviews have noted, but I have noticed that my restless/twitchy legs have been better since I started using it.</li>
            <li>What I like most about it is that it helps me to sleep.  </li>
            <li>but on my inner forearms with no stinging, even on my neck- awesome!  </li>
            <li>Great stuff, and blood levels for magnesium returned to normal after just 3 days.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, I will ALWAYS state at the very top if I received the item complimentary from the vendor, and what I DON&#x27;T like about the product(if any)</li>
            <li>I think most people are lacking magnesium, so this is an easy way to add it to our lives.</li>
            <li>Love it, spray bottle makes it so easy to use</li>
            <li>This is a generous 12 ounce bottle with a spray top for easy application.</li>
            <li>A very good product that I would definitely recommend if you have had problems with oral magnesium that causes digestive disturbances.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Worked very good for me.&lt;br /&gt;would reorder it in the future.</li>
            <li>Works great so far.</li>
            <li>If it does sting, then my levels are becoming depleted.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s health benefits are impressive (improved sleep, mood, heart health, a long list), and magnesium oil is hands down the best way to get magnesium into the system.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First, the experience of the foot soak is most pleasant after a busy day.  </li>
            <li>right now I&#x27;m thrilled.    </li>
            <li>Next best thing was this spray which I think logically would work better than a bath anyway</li>
            <li>Works well and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This product makes it easy,</li>
            <li>My new massage therapist recommended this oil, said the magnesium is good for aches and pains, sore muscles, cramping.  </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s fine because I get up at about that time.</li>
            <li>I was fine at 2AM and in torture at 7AM, I was up at 2.</li>
            <li>After doing some research, we determined that this magnesium oil would work just fine for her magnesium deficiency.</li>
            <li>The oil doesn&#x27;t have any foul odors which was a pleasant surprise as I tend to be sensitive to that.</li>
            <li>You get a nice large bottle and the sprayer works well.&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
            <li>It dribbles out rather large droplets of product rather than providing a nice spray pattern.</li>
            <li>It dribbles out rather large droplets of product rather than providing a nice spray pattern.</li>
            <li>Applying to the soles of my feet works best, but I&#x27;ve used it elsewhere and find little to no</li>
            <li>This product has been a huge help already in providing relief from night leg cramps.</li>
            <li>I was having a flair up and the Magnesium Oil arrived the same day it started, it worked great.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this product.</li>
            <li>After 20 minutes or so, you can use a baby powder, and gets smooth again (without washing off).  </li>
            <li>and this is such a great relief to me at night.</li>
            <li>Best to use a few minutes before.</li>
            <li>They were nice enough to follow through with my purchase and make sure I was 100% satisfied.  </li>
            <li>What a surprise to get an immediate response with detailed information, including testing analysis from their supplier.  </li>
            <li>I received this free in order to do a review</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product.  </li>
            <li>It is amazing that Magnesium Oil can address so much.</li>
            <li>chronic tension/soreness/migraines!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample to review.</li>
            <li>The oil is dispensed in a light mist and holding the bottle about 6 inches from your skin  will create about a 6&amp;#34; diameter circle of liquid.</li>
            <li>The oil leaves your skin tacky and I can feel a light adhesion when my skin rubs against clothes or bed sheets.</li>
            <li>Great product will definitely purchase again.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more easily absorbed by our bodies this way than through taking an oral supplement.</li>
            <li>Note: a free sample was provided for review purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supplements are almost always a tricky thing to evaluate, whether you&#x27;re writing or reading a review.  </li>
            <li>well, any more scared than I&#x27;d normally be :D, but I was surprised the first time at</li>
            <li>Seems good thus far.</li>
            <li>This product really works!!!</li>
            <li>I slept through the night for the first time in forever, AND, my headache went away!!</li>
            <li>And I tried it for a good long while before reviewing to make sure the spray mechanism didn&#x27;t clog.  </li>
            <li>ORIGINAL REVIEW:</li>
            <li>I got her all excited about using it</li>
            <li>so I was excited to try the Magnesium Oil body spray by Seven Minerals.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure they would be willing to work with you.  </li>
            <li>Does burn when you first start using it, however I love this product.</li>
            <li>was most interested in the sleep aid properties.</li>
            <li>The oil is light and disappears quickly into my skin.  </li>
            <li>And I can honestly say that when applying the oil to the bottom of my feet at night I have a more restful and usually uninterrupted sleep.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny not to have to bother to make one&#x27;s own, and MUCH improved with the addition of aloe vera.  </li>
            <li>Should you not quite achieve the desired level of pain relief, this natural remedy may still prove more than adequately beneficial to your health by mitigating skin problems and facilitating a noticeably better night’s</li>
            <li>Should you not quite achieve the desired level of pain relief, this natural remedy may still prove more than adequately beneficial to your health by mitigating skin problems and facilitating a noticeably better night’s</li>
            <li>One of the latest health crazes is Pure Magnesium Oil.</li>
            <li>Just a warning: when it dries it does sting a bit, but just run a cool wash cloth over your legs and it stops.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>Good way to get the magnesium to the body, now when we are concern about low magnesium in our diet.</li>
            <li>it really seems to help me sleep betterand have more energy which is basically what I was looking for</li>
            <li>and the itchy feeling they talk about actually feels good to my fibromyalgia.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li>I have experienced inconsistent itching, but it is minimal and goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always preferred minerals sourced from the Great Salt Lake, but other products have been inconsistent.  </li>
            <li>This bottle was supplied free of charge, this is my honest experience after using this bottle for several weeks.</li>
            <li>I ran out of my magnesium glycinate supplement and luckily had just received this in the mail because I had wanted to try it.</li>
            <li>I think it helps tremendously.  </li>
            <li>if it does it is mild and dissipates.  </li>
            <li>Works quickly.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product and it works quickly when my medication has not kicked in yet.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly without any oily residue.  </li>
            <li>Super convenient to apply</li>
            <li>Because my diet is pretty balanced already, I didn&#x27;t see huge benefits</li>
            <li>I live in Alberta and our autumns, winters, and springs bring Chinook winds and changes in barometric pressure, thus causing migraines among many residents.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any great change on my lower legs but had started to notice the rash area getting less so.</li>
            <li>Good for dry skin, too.</li>
            <li>This magnesium helps me with muscle pain and fatigue, migraines, joint pain, anxiety, better sleep, pretty much everything.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much for all the information, and for making such a wonderful product with such care and deliberation.</li>
            <li>my leg and back muscles are better!  </li>
            <li>Twenty four hrs after rubbing this oil into my back my pain is for the most part gone!</li>
            <li>Also, the first time I used it, I itched up a storm!</li>
            <li>As far as supplementation goes, many studies have found that transdermal magnesium chloride, such as found in this Magnesium Oil by Seven Mineral that I receives as a gift, are the most highly absorbable and effective way to get magnesium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>was so happy with this product that I made little spray bottles to share with friends and family.</li>
            <li>and I can use everyday with great convenience.  </li>
            <li>I have restless legs syndrome and read that magnesium oil would help calm my legs at night.</li>
            <li>But it works and it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I wish there were more natural remedies for every health issue.</li>
            <li>stuff is definitely worth a try if you have chronic pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But with the medications always changing the bodies electrolytes were always changing also, we also used Viva Labs Magnesium Bisecylcinate 200mg.which helped the magnesium be  absorbed.</li>
            <li>to me, it&#x27;s worth a try…..</li>
            <li>It is important to note that this product is only 75% of the strength of the oil without the added aloe vera, so you may want to use more sprays at a time.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not crazy about the pump spray.</li>
            <li>I will be buying this again as it&#x27;s worth the price of relief of RLS.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t stop touching my skin because when it dries my skin feels so soft &amp; supple</li>
            <li>I have been spraying it all over after showers and have come to like the tingle knowing that magesium is being absorbed.  </li>
            <li>that the manufacturer provided me with a complimentary sample for this hopefully unbiased review.</li>
            <li>Complimentary product</li>
            <li>The only drawback is a kind of itchy feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely worth trying if you have</li>
            <li>Seven Miracles was kind enough to send me a sample bottle for evaluation.  </li>
            <li>The spray leaves a residue that I don&#x27;t like, but for the benefits of magnesium, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used magnesium in a spray before I received this complimentary sample of Seven Minerals Magnesium oil (for review purposes).</li>
            <li>Seven minerals magnesium, not only was it an awesome product but the company itself went above and beyond to ensure any expectations were completely and full heartedly fulfilled.</li>
            <li>I have intermittent problems and pain with my right knee.  </li>
            <li>or this product is not the right one for me to address this issue.</li>
            <li>right now I&#x27;m thrilled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I spray my skin right after a shower when my skin is still moist...</li>
            <li>right.  </li>
            <li>spray some on the inside of your arms right before bed</li>
            <li>I used it a couple of times right after I worked out in the evening</li>
            <li>right away I notice that it works.</li>
            <li>I received a very large bottle  of Magnesium Oil.</li>
            <li>When I get up in the morning the skin on my feet and legs feels like sandpaper and looks ashy which is pretty impressive given how pale I am, so I apply more coconut oil, but by afternoon it&#x27;s dry and rough again which is kind of the pits now that we&#x27;re really getting into shorts and sandals season!</li>
            <li>The Seven Minerals Magnesium Oil with Aloe was not nearly as itchy while being quite effective to help control pain and microspasms in my limb that has chronic circulation issues.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;To be effective, Magnesium oil must be as pure as possible.</li>
            <li>(*) Product is very easy to apply, as you simply spray the liquid on to yourself.  </li>
            <li>Works good on bottoms of feet though if you want to take less mag pills or would rather spray your feet instead.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before I used this I searched online for information on using magnesium topically, and according to the information I read it is easily absorbed through the skin and many people have benefitted from using it.</li>
            <li>again thank you very much for your product</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very much like spraying or misting water on yourself from a spray bottle.  </li>
            <li>Part of me is excited, as I really want this to be the answer to my years of pain and part of me is still very cautious that the answer to my problems could be so simple!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only did it come exactly as expected, but I also received a nice follow up email from them checking to make sure.</li>
            <li>I started out doing just my feet the first week or so</li>
            <li>The squirting of magnesium spray I put on my knees for arthritis,  and later on my lower legs for neuropathy did more for my knee and leg pain than anything</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not totally healed, but the pain is more bearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although it has the ALOE VERA in it, still is ITCHY when first applied.  </li>
            <li>Since I have some thumb joint pain, I rub it in, using back of my hands, to get even more into my hand joints (and fingers)  </li>
            <li>I am low on magnesium and also take supplements, I&#x27;m feeling better but do not know which is working.  </li>
            <li>Really it didn&#x27;t bother me and for the benefits - worth it.</li>
            <li>the first two times I used to</li>
            <li>This mag oil seems potent and eases muscle spasms in my lower back.  </li>
            <li>I must have slept on my knee funny and did something to it.</li>
            <li>My first instinct was a pain med</li>
            <li>Occasionally I treat myself to a massage and will be sure to bring this along to be added to the massage oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Spraying the magnesium oil on my hot spots works immediately.</li>
            <li>I soaked my feet in hot water and sprayed the oil in water.  </li>
            <li>I have an itchy sensation at first,</li>
            <li>once the solution dries the itch goes away, it&#x27;s not uncomfortable at all</li>
            <li>Absolutely a miracle in a bottle!  </li>
            <li>This product does exactly what I needed it to do: STOPS my headaches that travel up my neck and into my scalp.  </li>
            <li>It was itchy the first time I used it</li>
            <li>I have restless leg syndrome, and I rub on my legs before I get into a hot bath every night.</li>
            <li>and I have just rounded out my first 10 days of using this.</li>
            <li>I am a first time user and have now become a lifetime user.</li>
            <li>I am really glad that I purchased this product and definitely will purchase it again.</li>
            <li>The first month I was using it, it made it so that I didn&#x27;t have a migraine  with my PMS.</li>
            <li>However, I have wanted something healthy in place of the usual deodorant which contains so many chemicals.</li>
            <li>After three days of using Magnesium Oil, I was enjoying 8 uninterrupted hours of sleep!  </li>
            <li>Shipping was so fast!</li>
            <li>When I first started using this oil it would itch and sting</li>
            <li>Takes the pain away and my feet can rest peacefully.</li>
            <li>I mostly use magnesium flakes in a foot bath and occasionally use the spray when I don&#x27;t have time to soak.  </li>
            <li>it did indeed sting like heck at first</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about it, but it has helped with some post-surgery ankle and back pain that I have been having.  </li>
            <li>However, I truly don&#x27;t know how much this is worth.</li>
            <li>I am on my second bottle and I am not 100% sure if it is helping or not ,but i thought i would give it another chance.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s actually made a difference for me, nor would I be able to say that it would help you even if I did think it helped me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s different, I&#x27;m sure, but I can spray this formulation liberally everywhere</li>
            <li>/&gt;Additionally, I went to Amazon to see what books were available on the subject of magnesium and it turns out there are many.  </li>
            <li>I was especially interested in trying out this natural magnesium oil with aloe vera pain relief remedy on an elderly family member (now 92 years young!)</li>
            <li>I am not sure how effective it is because I have just started using it but am pleased so far</li>
            <li>I learned so much and had so many questions about fluid magnesium answered by reading the articles the company posts online.  </li>
            <li>While I take a supplement, I read only 4% may get to your system so decided to try this; a very convenient way to make sure it all goes where needed.</li>
            <li>This really does help me to sleep more deeply.</li>
            <li>: I really don&#x27;t like the sprayer very much.</li>
            <li>: I really don&#x27;t like the sprayer very much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read lots of positive reviews…..</li>
            <li>Both myself and my husband have used the magnesium with aloe spray and had positive results.  </li>
            <li>bottle lasts a long time and I love the convenience of a spray bottle that works well.</li>
            <li>Even though I still get a little itchy, I am in love with this product!</li>
            <li>However, after using it for a couple days, I can honestly say that my wrist is less sore.</li>
            <li>I used one of the suggestions in Max Sircus&#x27;s book, that is, soak my feet for twenty minutes with warm water and a bit less than an ounce of the magesium oil with aloe vera.  </li>
            <li>(one con of using on the bottom of the feet is that makes the feet more dry)</li>
            <li>I previously bought magnesium salts and have been making my own magnesium &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I certainly will continue to use this product and hopefully, my migraines get milder</li>
            <li>It certainly isn&#x27;t hurting, though.</li>
            <li>I am very grateful to all the people who have trusted my reviews over the years and have voted positively on my reviews.</li>
            <li>just kind of a mess.  </li>
            <li>Since I began following this advice, I have experienced fewer and less severe leg cramps during the night.</li>
            <li>Also, it is a very soluble liquid, and washes off easily and instantly without leaving any traces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very highly recommended.</li>
            <li>No perfumes or additives, just pure magnesium chloride and organic whole leaf aloe vera juice.  </li>
            <li>I will give the company credit in that over a month of use has only put a very small dent in the bottle, so I expect that a bottle would last a good long time - for those who do not have problems with skin irritation, it is a very good value.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, the second time was a lot more tolerable, and although it still itches a little sometimes, it&#x27;s fine, because...</li>
            <li>It is less drying, but also a little less strong and effective than the pure stuff.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll find magnesium oil in use at many spas around the world, and it is now readily available for the consumer.</li>
            <li>, although I really wanted it to work, leading me to believe that either my problems are not</li>
            <li>The magnesium oil with aloe vera worked really well to help build up my magnesium level and also soften skin.</li>
            <li>and he said it really helped.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;I really like this product.</li>
            <li>This has really been helping with my restless legs at night.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m going to see if it can handle real pain.</li>
            <li>12oz bottle should last a pretty long time making it cost effective.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m taking a medication that has a side effect of causing muscle cramps everywhere, and this magnesium oil really helps.</li>
            <li>The aloe vera helps with the itching you get from the oil, which is also a real plus.</li>
            <li>but it was too itchy for him, so he switched to the aloe vera version and hasn&#x27;t had much in the way of itching with it.</li>
            <li>We used the ALOE VERA Magnesium Oil and it was very helpful for relief.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Well... I was very apprehensive about trying it</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;One knee is a TKR and has caused me pain and swelling for</li>
            <li>It really seemed to help my aches and pains</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>so I am not taking Melatonin as much.</li>
            <li>or if it really works.  </li>
            <li>I returned mine, but the company was very gracious about the return.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say how it works</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This product is the real deal, very concentrated magnesium chloride</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;m not much of a pill taker, I switched to liquid, but then progressed to magnesium oil for better transdermal absorption.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t notice this doing much for me, but it seemed like it worked very well</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although we really really wanted to like this product and give it 5 stars, I cannot find the benefit that I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>It really helps my leg pain, and helps to relax me at night.</li>
            <li>It has really helped.</li>
            <li>My chiropractor said to spray it on all the lymph node areas and the body will absorb it readily that way.</li>
            <li>The quality of  my life is much improved.</li>
            <li>so much I didn&#x27;t want to keep using it.  </li>
            <li>But the aloe version really,  really helps.  </li>
            <li>It has helped me so much.</li>
            <li>I really like this product because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>This was very itchy...</li>
            <li>We also both started using it like an astrigent on our faces after having lifelong complexion/acne problem and I really love for that use.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also experiencing an all-around feeling of well-being.&lt;br /&gt;The word oil may be deceving, however, because it is very drying.  </li>
            <li>I really recommend you give this a try and see for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>just how much salt there was.  </li>
            <li>My migraines are so debilitating I have had an MRI just to make sure there was nothing else causing the severe pain, this came back clear.</li>
            <li>Okay, read the back of the bottle and it will warn you that there may be some itching early on.</li>
            <li>Not bad - the itching subsides quickly and is worse if applied some areas (top of feet, stomach) than others (arms, legs, bottom of feet).</li>
            <li>The soles of your feet are very sensitive, unless they are very calloused!</li>
            <li>Worked great to eleiminate long history of leg cramps related to low magnesium.  </li>
            <li>I know it may sound strange, but it makes you feel like it is really beneficial.  </li>
            <li>But after a week or so of using this (the manufacturer says you&#x27;ll see optimum benefits at two weeks or later), I found that I was staying asleep for longer and moving around less at night.</li>
            <li>The itchiness was mild, and I may have only really noticed it because the product notes mention it might happen&lt;br</li>
            <li>There were a couple of other benefits I was also interested in -- this is supposed to help you sleep, and magnesium is also effective against hypertension (though with this last one, if your blood pressure is dangerously high, you should be seeking the treatment of a physician!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It took a month of scraping the skin off gently with a pumice stone and using moisturizing cream to get them close to normal.</li>
            <li>My skin still itches every time I use it, however, it is not bad enough to make me stop using.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without!</li>
            <li>and I have a lot more good day than bad days.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m now a day and a half in and feel much better.</li>
            <li>the more often I used it the less</li>
            <li>and he sleeps better and wakes up feeling less achy.</li>
            <li>and they would go on for half an hour or more.</li>
            <li>would recommend this product for anyone who wants to use magnesium oil but has sensitive skin, this will be very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love it on my achey feet and an occasional sore spot on my back.</li>
            <li>and although I cannot claim to have noticed any additional pain relief for his lower leg problems and other bodily aches so far (most likely not related to a magnesium-deficiency), this combination of magnesium oil and aloe vera has provided an overall soothing, softening effect on his often irritated skin and has resulted in him being more relaxed and sleeping somewhat better at night.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure at all how that&#x27;s supposed to get through my skin which is a natural protector against all things outside of my body, but I&#x27;m trusting my grandmother who kept trying to get me hooked into Epsom Salts (great</li>
            <li>The instructions say that is normal, especially if your body has a magnesium deficiency, and that after several applications it will get better.</li>
            <li>I was able to get her to use it a couple more times afterwards, but it&#x27;s simply not worth her crying and jumping around.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to everyone.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s essentially a high magnesium salt water...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Magnesium Oil.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and I slept a little better too.</li>
            <li>The oil stings a little when I put it on certain muscles but passes very quickly for me.  </li>
            <li>I awarded Seven Minerals a second star based on exceptional customer service - within a few hours of my review going live, I had an email from Amazon telling me of my refund.</li>
            <li>I am shocked but also very happy!  </li>
            <li>I just cannot seem to be able to leave it on long enough to see if it helps....</li>
            <li>I use essential oils a lot on my feet though, so not sure I want to always use this spray but a good alternative to pills.</li>
            <li>It can nourish and moisturize your skin and is a safe way to up your magnesium intake, along with providing quite a few health benefits.</li>
            <li>I recently had lumbar spine surgery, so even though the surgery was deemed a success, I still have referred pain from lingering muscle spasms...which I&#x27;ve been told can take up to a year to resolve.  </li>
            <li>but I think that is normal and just the magnesium working.  </li>
            <li>I am not a negative being.</li>
            <li>My daughter is maintaining a normal blood pressure without  medication, using Magnesium Oil.  .</li>
            <li>Althoug it seems normal.</li>
            <li>I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT COMPLIMENTARY FOR THE PURPOSE OF MY OBJECTIVE REVIEW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, in mixing my own I&#x27;ve tried different proportions of water to salts, different bottles, and the dispenser always clogs, SUCH a pain.  </li>
            <li>husband&#x27;s right hand suddenly started hurting &amp; was swollen.</li>
            <li>If you are short on magnesium, and have muscle cramps, this may be the right product for you.</li>
            <li>I only put some on the inside of my arms right before bed</li>
            <li>I keep it in my basket of body lotions and potions and my new routine is to spray away!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to additives).</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t a scent and the Aloe leaves the skin very soft.</li>
            <li>This is the first topical magnesium I&#x27;ve ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>First time user of topical magnesium, and I do not think I will ever be without it!  </li>
            <li>And my son, who has suffered with restless leg syndrome for years, finally got some relief and slept through the night peacefully after rubbing his legs and feet with this stuff.</li>
            <li>I was already familiar with the skin/joint benefits of taking oral aloe vera capsules over an extended period of time (NatureCity Organic TrueAloe 200 mg capsules: 2 capsules twice daily for several years) and wanted to see whether magnesium would provide any additional mitigation of pain and discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think I injured using a weight machine on my first (and last) day at a gym.  </li>
            <li>Before using this he would have to stand in a hot shower just to get his muscles working well enough to get his day</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I ordered my second bottle before I emptied my first bottle.</li>
            <li>tried this for the first time over the weekend, I was in the middle of a tension headache spell, so I decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li>It was a pretty solid layer in areas</li>
            <li>and I live in a soft water area.  </li>
            <li>I do rub it in to knees...and that seems to be working at making my knees less pain filled.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Daily application of this magnesium chloride (USP – United States Pharmacopeia) preparation in its large 12-ounce unbreakable plastic spray bottle either before or after bathing/showering, is a simple task indeed.</li>
            <li>However, if you have autoimmune disease, you may want to steer clear, as magnesium stimulates the immune</li>
            <li>The instruction say to spray on skin, especially feet, and gently rub in.</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t get it off my hands fast enough after rubbing it into my feet.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, this was my &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; treatment for these horrendous leg cramps I developed in the past few years!&lt;br /&gt;-----------------&lt;br /&gt;Shockingly effective!</li>
            <li>I have used it a couple of times myself and I too am too sensitive to use it.</li>
            <li>So far it does all it is advertised to be.</li>
            <li>Plus, I haven&#x27;t found that the aloe minimizes the stinging/itchiness that mag oil causes in sensitive areas like the chest, neck, and shoulders.</li>
            <li>I did sleep through the next night and awoke to my knee not hurting nearly as much.</li>
            <li>I think the speed of the healing is a direct relationship to what I sprayed on my knee.</li>
            <li>the product has natural magnesium and organic Aloe Vera.  </li>
            <li>seems to help circulation near the surface.  </li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>I started a week ago to apply it to the bottom of my feet and directly to my knees</li>
            <li>but I did notice some itchiness on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>the chemicals aren&#x27;t working, so why not try something natural?  </li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m a believer.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>But I discovered that soft water lacks magnesium</li>
            <li>I think it is too early to rate</li>
            <li>The feet is supposed to be the gateway to all vital organs.</li>
            <li>The aloe leaves skin so soft.</li>
            <li>DO NOT PUT THIS ANYWHERE NEAR YOUR INCISION</li>
            <li>I discover it works as a natural deodorant also.</li>
            <li>Back to the crystal rock for deodorant because it&#x27;s much easier.</li>
            <li>I am 83 years old.</li>
            <li>Then I read in a couple of sources that taking a magnesium supplement along with spraying magnesium oil directly on the muscles would reduce and/or prevent leg cramps.</li>
            <li>it is eavening out the skin tone, tightening pores, and after rinsing off the salty leftover- my skin is sooo soft.  </li>
            <li>I also noticed a marked increase in my energy levels and mood.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s most common in people who do a lot of sports or sweat a lot from working outdoors, but as much as 80% of people are low in magnesium.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like folks that claim a diet pill really works for them, even though they started eating healthier and exercising at the same time they started taking it.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that reacts to everything, even tap water in some locales.  </li>
            <li>It helped but I was still in pain and thanks to having recently reviewed a cane able to at least get around my apartment.</li>
            <li>I rub some on my achy neck after looking over a drafting table for a few hours and instantly my neck feels better.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Magnesium &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34;, which is not really an oil (it&#x27;s magnesium chloride), is found in brine harvested from ancient sea beds, and can be absorbed through the skin.</li>
            <li>It is a little bit sticky, but it&#x27;s completely worth it!</li>
            <li>It is not very oily, so you can put your pajamas on right over it.</li>
            <li>Usually by the next morning my muscles feel better.  </li>
            <li>It can be sprayed on the entire body with particular attention being paid to those areas that are painful/causing problems and the bottom of the feet, recommended by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to apply and I have not experienced any burning for itching .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is a little itchy, but not bad.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little oily, but not bad at all&lt;br</li>
            <li>Use a small amount and enjoy.</li>
            <li>After 2 nights of not applying it, my skin is almost back to normal with respect to the dryness.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Seven Minerals Magnesium oil for about a week now, and as with many vitamin and mineral supplements it&#x27;s hard to say it&#x27;s definitely working.</li>
            <li>If you spray too much, it will dry but will remain sticky</li>
            <li>This stuff really works, in only a week my back and shoulder pain had reduced dramatically.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I decided to evaluate this oil mainly because of the following - the company offers a 360 day money back guarantee.  </li>
            <li>Additionally spraying repeatedly every day for a few days quickly resolved a fungal issue, as well.</li>
            <li>The other parts certainly helped but I think the speed of the healing is a direct relationship to what I sprayed on my knee.</li>
            <li>Not sure whether it&#x27;s a placebo, but it does seem to help significantly with sleep.</li>
            <li>, I have a 92 year old mother in law with aches and pains all over, and since my wife has been rubbing her mothers sore body with they magnesium oil , it has significantly dropped her pain level ,as well as my wife who has restless leg syndrome ,and since we have been using this on her legs she has finally been able to get the sleep she needs and deserves so badly .once</li>
            <li>I put this next to my bed the other night, and when the cramps started, I rubbed this right on the spot, and got immediate relief.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it has a bad smell of smelly feet stink too high heaven even though it has its good benefits</li>
            <li>It is great for leg cramps, painful muscles, joints and just anywhere your body is exhibiting pain.  </li>
            <li>The instructions for use were clear, and so far, after just a few days, I can really notice a difference.</li>
            <li>It does feel a tiny bit sticky, but the relief it gives far out weighs any residual feeling which you can wash off anyway.</li>
            <li>Initially I purchased this for my 5 yr old.</li>
            <li>I was in pain and could barely put any weight on my leg.</li>
            <li>I have been researching magnesium and decided it was a vital mineral that I wasn&#x27;t getting enough of.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now diligently been using this remedy on the aforementioned old-timer for nearly three weeks</li>
            <li>I have been using a brand by Seven Minerals because it is tested and purified and in a natural state, and I&#x27;m definitely hooked.</li>
            <li>I suffer from frequent tension headaches and they can last up to 10 days and</li>
            <li>she calls it a slight tingling ... when it is first applied.</li>
            <li>Other than that small issue of the top</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now ready for other problems, should they arise.  </li>
            <li>I stopped using any other astringent and lotion and it has really revitalized my skin-</li>
            <li>Because of this, it&#x27;s a bit difficult to get good coverage on the bottom of my feet, since I can&#x27;t turn my feet completely upside down to where they&#x27;re horizontal.</li>
            <li>Because of this, it&#x27;s a bit difficult to get good coverage on the bottom of my feet, since I can&#x27;t turn my feet completely upside down to where they&#x27;re horizontal.</li>
            <li>Most of us are deficient in magnesium which has been linked with numerous health issues:&lt;br /&gt;Depression&lt;br /&gt;Fatigue&lt;br</li>
            <li>Magnesium is found naturally in green leafy vegetables, cashew nuts and pumpkin seeds, and some legumes like black beans, but many people don&#x27;t eat enough of these foods to get sufficient</li>
            <li>I rub it on my shoulders on front and back, on my upper chest and pretty much all my arms after a hard work out.  </li>
            <li>It does tingle and burn a little bit  at first but goes away and after repeated use it doesn&#x27;t burn anymore.</li>
            <li>(*) I felt a little itchiness when applied to my torso, but none at all when applied to my arms and feet.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The oil does not feel at all oily, in fact, when it goes on it feels strangely dry, but leaves your skin feeling smooth, sort of slick.</li>
            <li>It appears that as many as 80% of the American public are magnesium deficient.  </li>
            <li>I certainly don&#x27;t feel I have to use it every night which is odd.</li>
            <li>Leaves a slightly sticky residue that really isn&#x27;t noticeable and goes away in a bit.</li>
            <li>After I shower, I spray the magnesium on and let it dry before I apply my natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>product is certainly worth purchasing to see what if anything it might do for you since the manufacturer does provide a 100%, no questions asked, money back guarantee for 360 days if you are not satisfied for any reason.</li>
            <li>that the manufacturer provided me with a complimentary sample for this hopefully unbiased review.s provide a 100%, no questions asked, money back guarantee for 360 days if you are not satisfied for any reason.</li>
            <li>(*) There was a very noticeable layer of salt residue left behind on my skin.  </li>
            <li>This product is free of organic volatile impurities and heavy metal detection is insignificant (less than 0.001%).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The slight salt residue which is occasionally noticed on the skin is not bothersome and can be readily wiped off if desired; post-application skin itchiness was not a problem for us.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was a little too much for me as just a soothing oil but definitely helped the restless leg syndrome.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It is so awesome to have another item in my pain management tool box that doesn&#x27;t involve a pill that must circulate systematically through my body when in reality,  and Magnesium spray would be the best solution.  </li>

            <li> Just my own experience -</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good product getting more accustom to your skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so much itchy as buzzy (best word for me).</li>
            <li> /&gt;The absolute best part is this.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;The seller sent a nice email before the product came with additional information on how to use it.</li>
            <li> It is a nice oil.  </li>
            <li> Just as suggested by Sircus and many others, the foot soak with magnesium is a good thing to do at night to promote restful sleep.  </li>
            <li> Nice product, I use it every day after I shower.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to mix my own.</li>
            <li> can say I am using it and loving it..</li>
            <li> Given To Me For An Honest Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Magnesium Oil with Aloe Vera by Seven Minerals</li>
            <li> If it works for you, great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample to test and provide an honest opinion.  </li>
            <li> Really liked it.  </li>
            <li> but getting more magnesium into my system while I&#x27;m healing is a good thing.</li>
            <li> I thought mauve it wasn&#x27;t as effective,  </li>
            <li> I have been using Magnesium oil for over a month now, and I am loving it.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase my own &amp; went with Seven Minerals with aloe Vera.  </li>
            <li> This is the best by far!!  </li>
            <li> I do love your products and am very pleased with the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : I received a free sample in exchange for a fair and honest review.</li>
            <li> It has a light and pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> Used hand-in-hand with a good moisturizer, this is a wonderful supplment to add to your daily health regime.</li>

            <li> Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this product prepping and recovering for triathlons , my legs feels much better because of it !</li>
            <li> it is wonderful ,and I would gladly be a spokesperson for this particular product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use this more when the temps warm</li>
            <li> believe this is a convenient and effective way to add magnesium to your body, and people with more severe cramping issues could find some relief from it.</li>
            <li> also wanted to mention that I received the product very quickly Seven Minerals shipped it fast and the service was excellent.</li>
            <li> Great Product and really does work!</li>
            <li> Positive results and great customer service.</li>
            <li> This is well-tested, pure, and gives me consistently great results.  </li>
            <li> I feel more relaxed.</li>
            <li> However, mine was delivered without the top.</li>
            <li> She loves this stuff now and is convinced it worked as well as or better than the Epsom</li>
            <li> I apply in the morning, put my socks on, go to work ( I am a nurse) and my feet feel so much better.</li>
            <li> As it&#x27;s itching, I find myself rubbing it in more.  </li>
            <li> I like it best when used on areas that don&#x27;t rub together, so use on outside of  arms, front of legs, stomach, buttocks,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to put a lot more weight on my knee and walk with the cane just as a balance aide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And there are more.  </li>
            <li> Oil comes in a twelve ounce plastic bottle with a spray top.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased to have received this product and will continue using it.  </li>
            <li> ok, but makes my skin itch</li>
            <li> I have already written a review on how great magnesium with aloe vera really works, now to extend my comment</li>
            <li> and I feel more relaxed.  </li>
            <li> At night time I rest better and I&#x27;ve been able to get a better night sleep.  </li>
            <li> love this -</li>
            <li> but I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Magnesium in all its forms</li>
            <li> The aloe vera added takes away most of the itchiness and makes the spray more moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I feel better, more balanced and energized than I did before using it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve any questions, the customer service department is on top of everything</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m out real quick.</li>
            <li> love the addition of aloe to it...</li>
            <li> I find I sleep better since using this product.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I learned about Magnesium Oil reading a book on how to sleep better.  </li>
            <li> I plan to buy more.</li>
            <li> This product is okay.</li>
            <li> Interesting product.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully better muscle and heart health results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than I could have imagined.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic for muscle cramps, bruises and tension headaches!</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> I feel better after rubbing it on</li>
            <li> All I can say is I love it...</li>
            <li> No need to take oral drug any more.</li>
            <li> Seems to have cured these two problems :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product, thanks</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and will continue to use it faithfully.  </li>
            <li> but sure wish I could give it many, many more.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t too sure about this magnesium oil, I have never used it before but wanted to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I will continue using this to see if we notice any more health improvements.</li>
            <li> We tried it in many scenarios and for us ... did not seem to provide visible or tangible benefit.</li>
            <li> one more thing:</li>
            <li> This has been interesting to use.</li>
            <li> Great product that has really helped decrease migraine frequency.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure this was what was helping.</li>
            <li> After taking the liquid, ionic magnesium I was impressed with the instant results (in some ways).</li>
            <li> but my mood is better.</li>
            <li> My wife has many allergies (including ALL corn products, i.e. corn starch, etc).</li>
            <li> Most pills use a corn starch binder.</li>
            <li> Any magnesium that goes through her digestive system causes many problems.</li>
            <li> The bottle has a spray nozzle on top.</li>
            <li> Then I do the foot bath more often.</li>
            <li> As a result, I&#x27;m feeling much more rested in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (A better spray pattern could be used on a vertical</li>
            <li> (A better spray pattern could be used on a vertical</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m finding that I&#x27;m moving much better.</li>
            <li> I bought some for my brother-in-law and this magnesium oil has helped his shoulder move much better.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this to see if it gets better with time.</li>
            <li> There are many reason to use magnesium.</li>
            <li> The Seven Minerals w/o aloe may be a better product.</li>
            <li> When product was delivered, it had a piece of tape on top of bottle, appearing to hold the cap on.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m okay with this).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice the itching some reviews have noted, but I have noticed that my restless/twitchy legs have been better since I started using it.</li>
            <li> What I like most about it is that it helps me to sleep.  </li>
            <li> but on my inner forearms with no stinging, even on my neck- awesome!  </li>
            <li> Great stuff, and blood levels for magnesium returned to normal after just 3 days.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, I will ALWAYS state at the very top if I received the item complimentary from the vendor, and what I DON&#x27;T like about the product(if any)</li>
            <li> I think most people are lacking magnesium, so this is an easy way to add it to our lives.</li>
            <li> Love it, spray bottle makes it so easy to use</li>
            <li> This is a generous 12 ounce bottle with a spray top for easy application.</li>
            <li> A very good product that I would definitely recommend if you have had problems with oral magnesium that causes digestive disturbances.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Worked very good for me.&lt;br /&gt;would reorder it in the future.</li>
            <li> Works great so far.</li>
            <li> If it does sting, then my levels are becoming depleted.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s health benefits are impressive (improved sleep, mood, heart health, a long list), and magnesium oil is hands down the best way to get magnesium into the system.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First, the experience of the foot soak is most pleasant after a busy day.  </li>
            <li> right now I&#x27;m thrilled.    </li>
            <li> Next best thing was this spray which I think logically would work better than a bath anyway</li>
            <li> Works well and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This product makes it easy,</li>
            <li> My new massage therapist recommended this oil, said the magnesium is good for aches and pains, sore muscles, cramping.  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s fine because I get up at about that time.</li>
            <li> I was fine at 2AM and in torture at 7AM, I was up at 2.</li>
            <li> After doing some research, we determined that this magnesium oil would work just fine for her magnesium deficiency.</li>
            <li> The oil doesn&#x27;t have any foul odors which was a pleasant surprise as I tend to be sensitive to that.</li>
            <li> You get a nice large bottle and the sprayer works well.&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
            <li> It dribbles out rather large droplets of product rather than providing a nice spray pattern.</li>
            <li> It dribbles out rather large droplets of product rather than providing a nice spray pattern.</li>
            <li> Applying to the soles of my feet works best, but I&#x27;ve used it elsewhere and find little to no</li>
            <li> This product has been a huge help already in providing relief from night leg cramps.</li>
            <li> I was having a flair up and the Magnesium Oil arrived the same day it started, it worked great.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this product.</li>
            <li> After 20 minutes or so, you can use a baby powder, and gets smooth again (without washing off).  </li>
            <li> and this is such a great relief to me at night.</li>
            <li> Best to use a few minutes before.</li>
            <li> They were nice enough to follow through with my purchase and make sure I was 100% satisfied.  </li>
            <li> What a surprise to get an immediate response with detailed information, including testing analysis from their supplier.  </li>
            <li> I received this free in order to do a review</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product.  </li>
            <li> It is amazing that Magnesium Oil can address so much.</li>
            <li> chronic tension/soreness/migraines!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample to review.</li>
            <li> The oil is dispensed in a light mist and holding the bottle about 6 inches from your skin  will create about a 6&amp;#34; diameter circle of liquid.</li>
            <li> The oil leaves your skin tacky and I can feel a light adhesion when my skin rubs against clothes or bed sheets.</li>
            <li> Great product will definitely purchase again.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more easily absorbed by our bodies this way than through taking an oral supplement.</li>
            <li> Note: a free sample was provided for review purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supplements are almost always a tricky thing to evaluate, whether you&#x27;re writing or reading a review.  </li>
            <li> well, any more scared than I&#x27;d normally be :D, but I was surprised the first time at</li>
            <li> Seems good thus far.</li>
            <li> This product really works!!!</li>
            <li> I slept through the night for the first time in forever, AND, my headache went away!!</li>
            <li> And I tried it for a good long while before reviewing to make sure the spray mechanism didn&#x27;t clog.  </li>
            <li> ORIGINAL REVIEW:</li>
            <li> I got her all excited about using it</li>
            <li> so I was excited to try the Magnesium Oil body spray by Seven Minerals.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure they would be willing to work with you.  </li>
            <li> Does burn when you first start using it, however I love this product.</li>
            <li> was most interested in the sleep aid properties.</li>
            <li> The oil is light and disappears quickly into my skin.  </li>
            <li> And I can honestly say that when applying the oil to the bottom of my feet at night I have a more restful and usually uninterrupted sleep.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny not to have to bother to make one&#x27;s own, and MUCH improved with the addition of aloe vera.  </li>
            <li> Should you not quite achieve the desired level of pain relief, this natural remedy may still prove more than adequately beneficial to your health by mitigating skin problems and facilitating a noticeably better night’s</li>
            <li> Should you not quite achieve the desired level of pain relief, this natural remedy may still prove more than adequately beneficial to your health by mitigating skin problems and facilitating a noticeably better night’s</li>
            <li> One of the latest health crazes is Pure Magnesium Oil.</li>
            <li> Just a warning: when it dries it does sting a bit, but just run a cool wash cloth over your legs and it stops.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> Good way to get the magnesium to the body, now when we are concern about low magnesium in our diet.</li>
            <li> it really seems to help me sleep betterand have more energy which is basically what I was looking for</li>
            <li> and the itchy feeling they talk about actually feels good to my fibromyalgia.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li> I have experienced inconsistent itching, but it is minimal and goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always preferred minerals sourced from the Great Salt Lake, but other products have been inconsistent.  </li>
            <li> This bottle was supplied free of charge, this is my honest experience after using this bottle for several weeks.</li>
            <li> I ran out of my magnesium glycinate supplement and luckily had just received this in the mail because I had wanted to try it.</li>
            <li> I think it helps tremendously.  </li>
            <li> if it does it is mild and dissipates.  </li>
            <li> Works quickly.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product and it works quickly when my medication has not kicked in yet.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly without any oily residue.  </li>
            <li> Super convenient to apply</li>
            <li> Because my diet is pretty balanced already, I didn&#x27;t see huge benefits</li>
            <li> I live in Alberta and our autumns, winters, and springs bring Chinook winds and changes in barometric pressure, thus causing migraines among many residents.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any great change on my lower legs but had started to notice the rash area getting less so.</li>
            <li> Good for dry skin, too.</li>
            <li> This magnesium helps me with muscle pain and fatigue, migraines, joint pain, anxiety, better sleep, pretty much everything.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for all the information, and for making such a wonderful product with such care and deliberation.</li>
            <li> my leg and back muscles are better!  </li>
            <li> Twenty four hrs after rubbing this oil into my back my pain is for the most part gone!</li>
            <li> Also, the first time I used it, I itched up a storm!</li>
            <li> As far as supplementation goes, many studies have found that transdermal magnesium chloride, such as found in this Magnesium Oil by Seven Mineral that I receives as a gift, are the most highly absorbable and effective way to get magnesium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> was so happy with this product that I made little spray bottles to share with friends and family.</li>
            <li> and I can use everyday with great convenience.  </li>
            <li> I have restless legs syndrome and read that magnesium oil would help calm my legs at night.</li>
            <li> But it works and it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I wish there were more natural remedies for every health issue.</li>
            <li> stuff is definitely worth a try if you have chronic pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But with the medications always changing the bodies electrolytes were always changing also, we also used Viva Labs Magnesium Bisecylcinate 200mg.which helped the magnesium be  absorbed.</li>
            <li> to me, it&#x27;s worth a try…..</li>
            <li> It is important to note that this product is only 75% of the strength of the oil without the added aloe vera, so you may want to use more sprays at a time.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not crazy about the pump spray.</li>
            <li> I will be buying this again as it&#x27;s worth the price of relief of RLS.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t stop touching my skin because when it dries my skin feels so soft &amp; supple</li>
            <li> I have been spraying it all over after showers and have come to like the tingle knowing that magesium is being absorbed.  </li>
            <li> that the manufacturer provided me with a complimentary sample for this hopefully unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Complimentary product</li>
            <li> The only drawback is a kind of itchy feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely worth trying if you have</li>
            <li> Seven Miracles was kind enough to send me a sample bottle for evaluation.  </li>
            <li> The spray leaves a residue that I don&#x27;t like, but for the benefits of magnesium, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used magnesium in a spray before I received this complimentary sample of Seven Minerals Magnesium oil (for review purposes).</li>
            <li> Seven minerals magnesium, not only was it an awesome product but the company itself went above and beyond to ensure any expectations were completely and full heartedly fulfilled.</li>
            <li> I have intermittent problems and pain with my right knee.  </li>
            <li> or this product is not the right one for me to address this issue.</li>
            <li> right now I&#x27;m thrilled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I spray my skin right after a shower when my skin is still moist...</li>
            <li> right.  </li>
            <li> spray some on the inside of your arms right before bed</li>
            <li> I used it a couple of times right after I worked out in the evening</li>
            <li> right away I notice that it works.</li>
            <li> I received a very large bottle  of Magnesium Oil.</li>
            <li> When I get up in the morning the skin on my feet and legs feels like sandpaper and looks ashy which is pretty impressive given how pale I am, so I apply more coconut oil, but by afternoon it&#x27;s dry and rough again which is kind of the pits now that we&#x27;re really getting into shorts and sandals season!</li>
            <li> The Seven Minerals Magnesium Oil with Aloe was not nearly as itchy while being quite effective to help control pain and microspasms in my limb that has chronic circulation issues.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;To be effective, Magnesium oil must be as pure as possible.</li>
            <li> (*) Product is very easy to apply, as you simply spray the liquid on to yourself.  </li>
            <li> Works good on bottoms of feet though if you want to take less mag pills or would rather spray your feet instead.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before I used this I searched online for information on using magnesium topically, and according to the information I read it is easily absorbed through the skin and many people have benefitted from using it.</li>
            <li> again thank you very much for your product</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very much like spraying or misting water on yourself from a spray bottle.  </li>
            <li> Part of me is excited, as I really want this to be the answer to my years of pain and part of me is still very cautious that the answer to my problems could be so simple!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only did it come exactly as expected, but I also received a nice follow up email from them checking to make sure.</li>
            <li> I started out doing just my feet the first week or so</li>
            <li> The squirting of magnesium spray I put on my knees for arthritis,  and later on my lower legs for neuropathy did more for my knee and leg pain than anything</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not totally healed, but the pain is more bearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although it has the ALOE VERA in it, still is ITCHY when first applied.  </li>
            <li> Since I have some thumb joint pain, I rub it in, using back of my hands, to get even more into my hand joints (and fingers)  </li>
            <li> I am low on magnesium and also take supplements, I&#x27;m feeling better but do not know which is working.  </li>
            <li> Really it didn&#x27;t bother me and for the benefits - worth it.</li>
            <li> the first two times I used to</li>
            <li> This mag oil seems potent and eases muscle spasms in my lower back.  </li>
            <li> I must have slept on my knee funny and did something to it.</li>
            <li> My first instinct was a pain med</li>
            <li> Occasionally I treat myself to a massage and will be sure to bring this along to be added to the massage oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Spraying the magnesium oil on my hot spots works immediately.</li>
            <li> I soaked my feet in hot water and sprayed the oil in water.  </li>
            <li> I have an itchy sensation at first,</li>
            <li> once the solution dries the itch goes away, it&#x27;s not uncomfortable at all</li>
            <li> Absolutely a miracle in a bottle!  </li>
            <li> This product does exactly what I needed it to do: STOPS my headaches that travel up my neck and into my scalp.  </li>
            <li> It was itchy the first time I used it</li>
            <li> I have restless leg syndrome, and I rub on my legs before I get into a hot bath every night.</li>
            <li> and I have just rounded out my first 10 days of using this.</li>
            <li> I am a first time user and have now become a lifetime user.</li>
            <li> I am really glad that I purchased this product and definitely will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> The first month I was using it, it made it so that I didn&#x27;t have a migraine  with my PMS.</li>
            <li> However, I have wanted something healthy in place of the usual deodorant which contains so many chemicals.</li>
            <li> After three days of using Magnesium Oil, I was enjoying 8 uninterrupted hours of sleep!  </li>
            <li> Shipping was so fast!</li>
            <li> When I first started using this oil it would itch and sting</li>
            <li> Takes the pain away and my feet can rest peacefully.</li>
            <li> I mostly use magnesium flakes in a foot bath and occasionally use the spray when I don&#x27;t have time to soak.  </li>
            <li> it did indeed sting like heck at first</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about it, but it has helped with some post-surgery ankle and back pain that I have been having.  </li>
            <li> However, I truly don&#x27;t know how much this is worth.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle and I am not 100% sure if it is helping or not ,but i thought i would give it another chance.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s actually made a difference for me, nor would I be able to say that it would help you even if I did think it helped me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s different, I&#x27;m sure, but I can spray this formulation liberally everywhere</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, I went to Amazon to see what books were available on the subject of magnesium and it turns out there are many.  </li>
            <li> I was especially interested in trying out this natural magnesium oil with aloe vera pain relief remedy on an elderly family member (now 92 years young!)</li>
            <li> I am not sure how effective it is because I have just started using it but am pleased so far</li>
            <li> I learned so much and had so many questions about fluid magnesium answered by reading the articles the company posts online.  </li>
            <li> While I take a supplement, I read only 4% may get to your system so decided to try this; a very convenient way to make sure it all goes where needed.</li>
            <li> This really does help me to sleep more deeply.</li>
            <li> : I really don&#x27;t like the sprayer very much.</li>
            <li> : I really don&#x27;t like the sprayer very much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read lots of positive reviews…..</li>
            <li> Both myself and my husband have used the magnesium with aloe spray and had positive results.  </li>
            <li> bottle lasts a long time and I love the convenience of a spray bottle that works well.</li>
            <li> Even though I still get a little itchy, I am in love with this product!</li>
            <li> However, after using it for a couple days, I can honestly say that my wrist is less sore.</li>
            <li> I used one of the suggestions in Max Sircus&#x27;s book, that is, soak my feet for twenty minutes with warm water and a bit less than an ounce of the magesium oil with aloe vera.  </li>
            <li> (one con of using on the bottom of the feet is that makes the feet more dry)</li>
            <li> I previously bought magnesium salts and have been making my own magnesium &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I certainly will continue to use this product and hopefully, my migraines get milder</li>
            <li> It certainly isn&#x27;t hurting, though.</li>
            <li> I am very grateful to all the people who have trusted my reviews over the years and have voted positively on my reviews.</li>
            <li> just kind of a mess.  </li>
            <li> Since I began following this advice, I have experienced fewer and less severe leg cramps during the night.</li>
            <li> Also, it is a very soluble liquid, and washes off easily and instantly without leaving any traces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very highly recommended.</li>
            <li> No perfumes or additives, just pure magnesium chloride and organic whole leaf aloe vera juice.  </li>
            <li> I will give the company credit in that over a month of use has only put a very small dent in the bottle, so I expect that a bottle would last a good long time - for those who do not have problems with skin irritation, it is a very good value.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, the second time was a lot more tolerable, and although it still itches a little sometimes, it&#x27;s fine, because...</li>
            <li> It is less drying, but also a little less strong and effective than the pure stuff.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll find magnesium oil in use at many spas around the world, and it is now readily available for the consumer.</li>
            <li> , although I really wanted it to work, leading me to believe that either my problems are not</li>
            <li> The magnesium oil with aloe vera worked really well to help build up my magnesium level and also soften skin.</li>
            <li> and he said it really helped.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I really like this product.</li>
            <li> This has really been helping with my restless legs at night.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m going to see if it can handle real pain.</li>
            <li> 12oz bottle should last a pretty long time making it cost effective.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m taking a medication that has a side effect of causing muscle cramps everywhere, and this magnesium oil really helps.</li>
            <li> The aloe vera helps with the itching you get from the oil, which is also a real plus.</li>
            <li> but it was too itchy for him, so he switched to the aloe vera version and hasn&#x27;t had much in the way of itching with it.</li>
            <li> We used the ALOE VERA Magnesium Oil and it was very helpful for relief.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Well... I was very apprehensive about trying it</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;One knee is a TKR and has caused me pain and swelling for</li>
            <li> It really seemed to help my aches and pains</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> so I am not taking Melatonin as much.</li>
            <li> or if it really works.  </li>
            <li> I returned mine, but the company was very gracious about the return.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say how it works</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> This product is the real deal, very concentrated magnesium chloride</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;m not much of a pill taker, I switched to liquid, but then progressed to magnesium oil for better transdermal absorption.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t notice this doing much for me, but it seemed like it worked very well</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although we really really wanted to like this product and give it 5 stars, I cannot find the benefit that I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> It really helps my leg pain, and helps to relax me at night.</li>
            <li> It has really helped.</li>
            <li> My chiropractor said to spray it on all the lymph node areas and the body will absorb it readily that way.</li>
            <li> The quality of  my life is much improved.</li>
            <li> so much I didn&#x27;t want to keep using it.  </li>
            <li> But the aloe version really,  really helps.  </li>
            <li> It has helped me so much.</li>
            <li> I really like this product because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> This was very itchy...</li>
            <li> We also both started using it like an astrigent on our faces after having lifelong complexion/acne problem and I really love for that use.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also experiencing an all-around feeling of well-being.&lt;br /&gt;The word oil may be deceving, however, because it is very drying.  </li>
            <li> I really recommend you give this a try and see for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> just how much salt there was.  </li>
            <li> My migraines are so debilitating I have had an MRI just to make sure there was nothing else causing the severe pain, this came back clear.</li>
            <li> Okay, read the back of the bottle and it will warn you that there may be some itching early on.</li>
            <li> Not bad - the itching subsides quickly and is worse if applied some areas (top of feet, stomach) than others (arms, legs, bottom of feet).</li>
            <li> The soles of your feet are very sensitive, unless they are very calloused!</li>
            <li> Worked great to eleiminate long history of leg cramps related to low magnesium.  </li>
            <li> I know it may sound strange, but it makes you feel like it is really beneficial.  </li>
            <li> But after a week or so of using this (the manufacturer says you&#x27;ll see optimum benefits at two weeks or later), I found that I was staying asleep for longer and moving around less at night.</li>
            <li> The itchiness was mild, and I may have only really noticed it because the product notes mention it might happen&lt;br</li>
            <li> There were a couple of other benefits I was also interested in -- this is supposed to help you sleep, and magnesium is also effective against hypertension (though with this last one, if your blood pressure is dangerously high, you should be seeking the treatment of a physician!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took a month of scraping the skin off gently with a pumice stone and using moisturizing cream to get them close to normal.</li>
            <li> My skin still itches every time I use it, however, it is not bad enough to make me stop using.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without!</li>
            <li> and I have a lot more good day than bad days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m now a day and a half in and feel much better.</li>
            <li> the more often I used it the less</li>
            <li> and he sleeps better and wakes up feeling less achy.</li>
            <li> and they would go on for half an hour or more.</li>
            <li> would recommend this product for anyone who wants to use magnesium oil but has sensitive skin, this will be very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love it on my achey feet and an occasional sore spot on my back.</li>
            <li> and although I cannot claim to have noticed any additional pain relief for his lower leg problems and other bodily aches so far (most likely not related to a magnesium-deficiency), this combination of magnesium oil and aloe vera has provided an overall soothing, softening effect on his often irritated skin and has resulted in him being more relaxed and sleeping somewhat better at night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure at all how that&#x27;s supposed to get through my skin which is a natural protector against all things outside of my body, but I&#x27;m trusting my grandmother who kept trying to get me hooked into Epsom Salts (great</li>
            <li> The instructions say that is normal, especially if your body has a magnesium deficiency, and that after several applications it will get better.</li>
            <li> I was able to get her to use it a couple more times afterwards, but it&#x27;s simply not worth her crying and jumping around.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to everyone.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s essentially a high magnesium salt water...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Magnesium Oil.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and I slept a little better too.</li>
            <li> The oil stings a little when I put it on certain muscles but passes very quickly for me.  </li>
            <li> I awarded Seven Minerals a second star based on exceptional customer service - within a few hours of my review going live, I had an email from Amazon telling me of my refund.</li>
            <li> I am shocked but also very happy!  </li>
            <li> I just cannot seem to be able to leave it on long enough to see if it helps....</li>
            <li> I use essential oils a lot on my feet though, so not sure I want to always use this spray but a good alternative to pills.</li>
            <li> It can nourish and moisturize your skin and is a safe way to up your magnesium intake, along with providing quite a few health benefits.</li>
            <li> I recently had lumbar spine surgery, so even though the surgery was deemed a success, I still have referred pain from lingering muscle spasms...which I&#x27;ve been told can take up to a year to resolve.  </li>
            <li> but I think that is normal and just the magnesium working.  </li>
            <li> I am not a negative being.</li>
            <li> My daughter is maintaining a normal blood pressure without  medication, using Magnesium Oil.  .</li>
            <li> Althoug it seems normal.</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT COMPLIMENTARY FOR THE PURPOSE OF MY OBJECTIVE REVIEW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, in mixing my own I&#x27;ve tried different proportions of water to salts, different bottles, and the dispenser always clogs, SUCH a pain.  </li>
            <li> husband&#x27;s right hand suddenly started hurting &amp; was swollen.</li>
            <li> If you are short on magnesium, and have muscle cramps, this may be the right product for you.</li>
            <li> I only put some on the inside of my arms right before bed</li>
            <li> I keep it in my basket of body lotions and potions and my new routine is to spray away!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to additives).</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a scent and the Aloe leaves the skin very soft.</li>
            <li> This is the first topical magnesium I&#x27;ve ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> First time user of topical magnesium, and I do not think I will ever be without it!  </li>
            <li> And my son, who has suffered with restless leg syndrome for years, finally got some relief and slept through the night peacefully after rubbing his legs and feet with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I was already familiar with the skin/joint benefits of taking oral aloe vera capsules over an extended period of time (NatureCity Organic TrueAloe 200 mg capsules: 2 capsules twice daily for several years) and wanted to see whether magnesium would provide any additional mitigation of pain and discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think I injured using a weight machine on my first (and last) day at a gym.  </li>
            <li> Before using this he would have to stand in a hot shower just to get his muscles working well enough to get his day</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I ordered my second bottle before I emptied my first bottle.</li>
            <li> tried this for the first time over the weekend, I was in the middle of a tension headache spell, so I decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> It was a pretty solid layer in areas</li>
            <li> and I live in a soft water area.  </li>
            <li> I do rub it in to knees...and that seems to be working at making my knees less pain filled.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Daily application of this magnesium chloride (USP – United States Pharmacopeia) preparation in its large 12-ounce unbreakable plastic spray bottle either before or after bathing/showering, is a simple task indeed.</li>
            <li> However, if you have autoimmune disease, you may want to steer clear, as magnesium stimulates the immune</li>
            <li> The instruction say to spray on skin, especially feet, and gently rub in.</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t get it off my hands fast enough after rubbing it into my feet.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, this was my &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; treatment for these horrendous leg cramps I developed in the past few years!&lt;br /&gt;-----------------&lt;br /&gt;Shockingly effective!</li>
            <li> I have used it a couple of times myself and I too am too sensitive to use it.</li>
            <li> So far it does all it is advertised to be.</li>
            <li> Plus, I haven&#x27;t found that the aloe minimizes the stinging/itchiness that mag oil causes in sensitive areas like the chest, neck, and shoulders.</li>
            <li> I did sleep through the next night and awoke to my knee not hurting nearly as much.</li>
            <li> I think the speed of the healing is a direct relationship to what I sprayed on my knee.</li>
            <li> the product has natural magnesium and organic Aloe Vera.  </li>
            <li> seems to help circulation near the surface.  </li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> I started a week ago to apply it to the bottom of my feet and directly to my knees</li>
            <li> but I did notice some itchiness on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> the chemicals aren&#x27;t working, so why not try something natural?  </li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m a believer.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> But I discovered that soft water lacks magnesium</li>
            <li> I think it is too early to rate</li>
            <li> The feet is supposed to be the gateway to all vital organs.</li>
            <li> The aloe leaves skin so soft.</li>
            <li> DO NOT PUT THIS ANYWHERE NEAR YOUR INCISION</li>
            <li> I discover it works as a natural deodorant also.</li>
            <li> Back to the crystal rock for deodorant because it&#x27;s much easier.</li>
            <li> I am 83 years old.</li>
            <li> Then I read in a couple of sources that taking a magnesium supplement along with spraying magnesium oil directly on the muscles would reduce and/or prevent leg cramps.</li>
            <li> it is eavening out the skin tone, tightening pores, and after rinsing off the salty leftover- my skin is sooo soft.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed a marked increase in my energy levels and mood.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s most common in people who do a lot of sports or sweat a lot from working outdoors, but as much as 80% of people are low in magnesium.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like folks that claim a diet pill really works for them, even though they started eating healthier and exercising at the same time they started taking it.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that reacts to everything, even tap water in some locales.  </li>
            <li> It helped but I was still in pain and thanks to having recently reviewed a cane able to at least get around my apartment.</li>
            <li> I rub some on my achy neck after looking over a drafting table for a few hours and instantly my neck feels better.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Magnesium &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34;, which is not really an oil (it&#x27;s magnesium chloride), is found in brine harvested from ancient sea beds, and can be absorbed through the skin.</li>
            <li> It is a little bit sticky, but it&#x27;s completely worth it!</li>
            <li> It is not very oily, so you can put your pajamas on right over it.</li>
            <li> Usually by the next morning my muscles feel better.  </li>
            <li> It can be sprayed on the entire body with particular attention being paid to those areas that are painful/causing problems and the bottom of the feet, recommended by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to apply and I have not experienced any burning for itching .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is a little itchy, but not bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little oily, but not bad at all&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use a small amount and enjoy.</li>
            <li> After 2 nights of not applying it, my skin is almost back to normal with respect to the dryness.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Seven Minerals Magnesium oil for about a week now, and as with many vitamin and mineral supplements it&#x27;s hard to say it&#x27;s definitely working.</li>
            <li> If you spray too much, it will dry but will remain sticky</li>
            <li> This stuff really works, in only a week my back and shoulder pain had reduced dramatically.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I decided to evaluate this oil mainly because of the following - the company offers a 360 day money back guarantee.  </li>
            <li> Additionally spraying repeatedly every day for a few days quickly resolved a fungal issue, as well.</li>
            <li> The other parts certainly helped but I think the speed of the healing is a direct relationship to what I sprayed on my knee.</li>
            <li> Not sure whether it&#x27;s a placebo, but it does seem to help significantly with sleep.</li>
            <li> , I have a 92 year old mother in law with aches and pains all over, and since my wife has been rubbing her mothers sore body with they magnesium oil , it has significantly dropped her pain level ,as well as my wife who has restless leg syndrome ,and since we have been using this on her legs she has finally been able to get the sleep she needs and deserves so badly .once</li>
            <li> I put this next to my bed the other night, and when the cramps started, I rubbed this right on the spot, and got immediate relief.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it has a bad smell of smelly feet stink too high heaven even though it has its good benefits</li>
            <li> It is great for leg cramps, painful muscles, joints and just anywhere your body is exhibiting pain.  </li>
            <li> The instructions for use were clear, and so far, after just a few days, I can really notice a difference.</li>
            <li> It does feel a tiny bit sticky, but the relief it gives far out weighs any residual feeling which you can wash off anyway.</li>
            <li> Initially I purchased this for my 5 yr old.</li>
            <li> I was in pain and could barely put any weight on my leg.</li>
            <li> I have been researching magnesium and decided it was a vital mineral that I wasn&#x27;t getting enough of.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now diligently been using this remedy on the aforementioned old-timer for nearly three weeks</li>
            <li> I have been using a brand by Seven Minerals because it is tested and purified and in a natural state, and I&#x27;m definitely hooked.</li>
            <li> I suffer from frequent tension headaches and they can last up to 10 days and</li>
            <li> she calls it a slight tingling ... when it is first applied.</li>
            <li> Other than that small issue of the top</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now ready for other problems, should they arise.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using any other astringent and lotion and it has really revitalized my skin-</li>
            <li> Because of this, it&#x27;s a bit difficult to get good coverage on the bottom of my feet, since I can&#x27;t turn my feet completely upside down to where they&#x27;re horizontal.</li>
            <li> Because of this, it&#x27;s a bit difficult to get good coverage on the bottom of my feet, since I can&#x27;t turn my feet completely upside down to where they&#x27;re horizontal.</li>
            <li> Most of us are deficient in magnesium which has been linked with numerous health issues:&lt;br /&gt;Depression&lt;br /&gt;Fatigue&lt;br</li>
            <li> Magnesium is found naturally in green leafy vegetables, cashew nuts and pumpkin seeds, and some legumes like black beans, but many people don&#x27;t eat enough of these foods to get sufficient</li>
            <li> I rub it on my shoulders on front and back, on my upper chest and pretty much all my arms after a hard work out.  </li>
            <li> It does tingle and burn a little bit  at first but goes away and after repeated use it doesn&#x27;t burn anymore.</li>
            <li> (*) I felt a little itchiness when applied to my torso, but none at all when applied to my arms and feet.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The oil does not feel at all oily, in fact, when it goes on it feels strangely dry, but leaves your skin feeling smooth, sort of slick.</li>
            <li> It appears that as many as 80% of the American public are magnesium deficient.  </li>
            <li> I certainly don&#x27;t feel I have to use it every night which is odd.</li>
            <li> Leaves a slightly sticky residue that really isn&#x27;t noticeable and goes away in a bit.</li>
            <li> After I shower, I spray the magnesium on and let it dry before I apply my natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> product is certainly worth purchasing to see what if anything it might do for you since the manufacturer does provide a 100%, no questions asked, money back guarantee for 360 days if you are not satisfied for any reason.</li>
            <li> that the manufacturer provided me with a complimentary sample for this hopefully unbiased review.s provide a 100%, no questions asked, money back guarantee for 360 days if you are not satisfied for any reason.</li>
            <li> (*) There was a very noticeable layer of salt residue left behind on my skin.  </li>
            <li> This product is free of organic volatile impurities and heavy metal detection is insignificant (less than 0.001%).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The slight salt residue which is occasionally noticed on the skin is not bothersome and can be readily wiped off if desired; post-application skin itchiness was not a problem for us.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was a little too much for me as just a soothing oil but definitely helped the restless leg syndrome.</li>
            <li> oil actually does... (after a few days) seem to calm down the pain... taking the edge off and also reduces the swelling and&lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not sure how much magnesium I actually get when applying to my skin, but I do like the way my skin feels after I use it.</li>
            <li> This product goes a long way, I will replace it as needed.&amp;#34; And last night I rubbed some on the bottom of my feet as they also suggest, and I slept through the entire night.</li>
            <li> Hmmm, not sure if it really works for the purpose</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s plenty in the bottle, so it should last a long time.</li>
            <li> The stinging doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I have not used magnesium oil before, although I have definitely taken some long soaks in the tub with epsom salts, so I know the power of magnesium sulfate to soothe muscle aches.</li>
            <li> no skin irritation and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed that it didn&#x27;t work for me after hearing all of the good reviews.</li>
            <li> The skin on the bottom of my feet is pretty thick and does not get irritated with the use of this product.</li>
            <li> I took 4 bottles , I nearly finished 1 , maybe there is slight effect, I&#x27;ll still continue using it</li>
            <li> It comes in handy for painful legs especially those with fibromyalgia.  </li>
            <li> I do spray it on and let it air dry as much as possible...</li>
            <li> , let it air dry, and leave it on until the next evening&#x27;s bath.  </li>
            <li> There was no leakage; however, I have found it very hard to squeeze the product out (I am able to spray small amounts out though,</li>
            <li> The only negative is s slight burning sensation, but it&#x27;s not uncomfortable and doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Here are a few common signs that you may need more magnesium: anxiety, high blood pressure, fatigue, difficulty sleeping, poor memory, confusion....  </li>
            <li> He had been getting really bad leg cramps at night, this magnesium oil has lessened his leg cramps and also seems to have brought him a bit more relief from his sore back and muscles, but that could have just been the back rub working too.</li>
            <li> or so I will update this review and give readers my report on long term advantages of using magnesium oil with aloe vera.my report on long term advantages of using magnesium oil with aloe vera.</li>
            <li> As long as this stuff keeps working, I&#x27;m going to keep buying.</li>
            <li> It felt strange when I applied it,...</li>
            <li> Works well and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> you have a minor muscle problem maybe this will help.  </li>
            <li> I have used Ancient Minerals Magnesium Oil previously, however it was quite itchy which is a sign my body was definitely needing the extra magnesium.</li>
            <li> I had been using a different brand of magnesium oil previously, but that product left my skin so itchy</li>
            <li> On my other knee, which I recently sprained...</li>
            <li> The oil doesn&#x27;t burn like regular magnesium oil due to the Aloe Vera.</li>
            <li> I will keep applying on other areas, like my back and joints, and update this review after a while.</li>
            <li> There was some very minor itchiness one day.  </li>
            <li> Does take a minute or so to dry.</li>
            <li> Spray it all over and air dry.</li>
            <li> After a shower, just dry off and spray it on.</li>
            <li> I also put some on the soles of my feet, but my feet became too dry...</li>
            <li> The inconvenience is after spraying it on, you have to give it time to dry.</li>
            <li> The directions say to spray and let dry, but it is an oil and doesn&#x27;t really dry.</li>
            <li> I had to vary the location of my body where I sprayed the oil as it leaves the skin extremely dry.</li>
            <li> I spray it on my feet and let it dry before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> Lately, the main thing I&#x27;ve been wanting for this product is improved sleep, and I&#x27;m getting that</li>
            <li> (*) I haven&#x27;t yet noticed any changes in regards to aches/pains/anything, but I&#x27;ve only used it a few times&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the layer of salt left behind, I suggest using this before you bathe.  </li>
            <li> I sprayed down my knee let it dry and patted dry the rest of the moisture left.</li>
            <li> We finally found a product that helps to relieve the pain as well as other muscular aches and pain!</li>
            <li> That hasn&#x27;t happened in a very long time!</li>
            <li> and I am amazed how my joints are less achy, especially my feet.  </li>
            <li> It makes my legs ever so slightly itchy the day after I use it, so I don&#x27;t use it daily.  </li>
            <li> Specifically, there is less of a tendency for him to awaken several times during the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put the oil on my stomach daily, and it reduces a typical post-surgery side effect from my hysterectomy:</li>
            <li> I recommend spraying an hour before bed, chilling out for 30 minutes then rinsing off in a quick shower before hopping between the sheets.</li>
            <li> then my feet felt very dry.</li>
            <li> I tried it on a lingering bad ankle sprain, and so far it has helped tremendously with the pain.</li>
            <li> I apply it to my lower legs and feet as directed at night and grit my teeth for 20 minutes, then I rinse it off in the shower (I shower at night, not in the morning) and slather coconut oil on the damp skin to seal in the moisture, but within a few hours my skin is dry and itchy, often enough to wake me up - I have to put on knee socks</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as bad as say a rash or a flea bite, it was more like just shaven legs or maybe wearing wool fabric.</li>
            <li> it just starts itching me and irritating me so much that I must wash it off.  </li>
            <li> It does have a curious feeling going on your skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really an oil but magnesium water with aloe Vera.  </li>
            <li> I was having some trouble with falling and staying asleep prior to using this</li>
            <li> I am going to transfer this to an empty bottle with a trigger spray.</li>
            <li> I have only had this a few days and have not seen the &amp;#34;instant calmness&amp;#34; that others have written about.  </li>
            <li> give it five stars for ease of application and having no financial risk because of the guarantee, but I give it four stars overall because of the amount of salt residue left behind.  </li>
            <li> give it five stars for ease of application and having no financial risk because of the guarantee, but I give it four stars overall because of the amount of salt residue left behind.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m just not ready to go down the long road of recovery yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has helped alleviate my leg cramping, it has helped with my bad neck &amp; stiff shoulders…I love this product &amp; only wish I had found out about it sooner!</li>
            <li> It seems to help some, but it certainly not a miracle cure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the oil helps with painful muscles like I&#x27;ve read in other reviews.  </li>
            <li> However, next order will be without tha aloe vera -- this made the product slow to dry with a stickly sensation.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to use as a supplement to accompany my other suplements I take for my bones.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;itchiness&amp;#34; I have experiences a couple of times is minimal!  </li>
            <li> If this is supposed to be the less-irritating version, I&#x27;m not sure I even want to think about what the regular stuff is like!</li>
            <li> Although difficult to give exact analysis, I believe it is working well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Usually the cramps would not return for  several hours.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t experience any of the itching, that other reviewers have mentioned.  </li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t tried any other brand</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t compare one from the other.</li>
            <li> am using it due to muscle spasms and muscle soreness.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be looking at other products by Seven Minerals.</li>
            <li> One may have something to do with the other -</li>
            <li> The doctor has tried me on many types of medications - all of which made me quite unwell to say the least, but I was so desperate I had to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend this to clients as well (exercise professional), but be wary of the extra tingling on the skin.  </li>
            <li> A couple of days ago I woke up with essentially no right knee.</li>
            <li> It is less itchy than other magnesium oils I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know that this is having a huge effect on my blood pressure, but my blood pressure wasn&#x27;t too bad to begin with, and I&#x27;m also altering my diet and exercise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what long term benefits will follow from this practice, but I can see no downside to the foot soak</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but it really worked.  </li>
            <li> However, the precise reason I purchased this spray-on magnesium was for horrible muscle spasms in my back for the last three months.</li>
            <li> (Of course I am mindful of  carbohydrates, eat no simple carbs and the complex  ones in moderation.)  </li>
            <li> /&gt;He has not experienced itchiness or rashes, even though he has extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the sour smell of the oil.</li>
            <li> but it does seem to have helped it so far from getting worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m down to one Advil and will probably cease that</li>
            <li> If you spray on right after your shower it stings like crazy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been applying Magnesium oil for a few days and I had a bad migraine the first day I started using it.</li>
            <li> After twenty minutes my feet feel relaxed and the numbness left over from a bad bout with sciatica is much improved.  </li>
            <li> After a half hour</li>
            <li> It leaves a slight residue, but I didn&#x27;t experience any itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There was a slight stinging sensation  on one arm</li>
            <li> Magnesium Oil with ALOE VERA (Makes it less itchy)</li>
            <li> My guess is that anyone reading this review will want to do what I did and that is go online and do some research on the subject of the importance of magnesium for our health and well being.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the addition of aloe makes it not itch and less sticky</li>
            <li> Seems to work to relax tense muscles and relax me overall in preparation to sleep</li>
            <li> It does leave my hands with a slightly tacky feel to it though</li>
            <li> I have used less, tried to rub in well, tried to remember to use it before a bath...</li>
            <li> If I spray this on softer/thinner skin (say, my calves or the tops of my feet), I do think it&#x27;s a little uncomfortable for a few minutes, although that fades fast</li>
            <li> The skin feels a little tight, but I have not itched at all.</li>
            <li> BUT it is so messy, smelly and itchy that it is hard to apply it in a time frame that allows it to soak in until dry, and then be washed off.</li>
            <li> I have kept this routine up for a little over 5 weeks hoping I would get used to it as the seller suggests but it still burns something wicked every time.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s a little prickly.  </li>
            <li> I use a little in the morning after my shower and a generous amount at night before bed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, but the 12 oz.</li>
            <li> It does sting a little</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like that it leaves my skin a little sticky/tacky</li>
            <li> : when I spray it on the bottom of my feet, I just feel a little wetness (you can rub it in if you want).</li>
            <li> how much I&#x27;m absorbing, and I&#x27;m cold after I spray it on - no fault of the product.</li>
            <li> who suffers from much discomfort and neuropathic pain associated with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) in both lower extremities.</li>
            <li> It works well as a deodorant (although in very humid areas the drying time might be inconvenient.)</li>
            <li> It seemed &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; and not comfortable</li>
            <li> No arguments or demands to return the bottle (which is the usual requirement for refunds and is often so costly to ship that it makes filing for a refund not worth it), and they even gave me some suggestions as to how I could try diluting the remaining product to see if it could be tolerable.  </li>
            <li> In a few days it subsided.</li>
            <li> In the winter, I tend to be a bit arthritic in a few joints, so I routinely sprayed those areas like my knees and hands.  </li>
            <li> , I sprayed the oil on and the pain was gone within a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> but after a few minutes I spay on some lotion and rub that in too.  </li>
            <li> I used a few squirts a day for 3-4 days, rubbing it in with a washcloth.  </li>
            <li> If you are having trouble getting to sleep or sleeping through the night, no problem ....</li>
            <li> I used it everyday after bath and notice my skin is so supple and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I have never had trouble falling asleep, but I have had a lot of trouble staying asleep (and sometimes I am quite restless during sleep</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> not sure if it works - symptoms are less severe</li>
            <li> I can get past the slight &amp;#34;stinging&amp;#34; people talk about but the aloe version is so greasy/filmy feeling</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is extreme fatigue.  </li>
            <li> It just plain works.</li>
            <li> Spray it on, give it a few minutes to absorb, then shower/bathe as usual to get the residue off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I won&#x27;t scratch myself raw.</li>
            <li> It does not &amp;#34;itch&amp;#34; on my skin, it BURNS - feels exactly like a bad sunburn - and it is unbelievably drying to my skin.</li>
            <li> The deep massage is too expensive to have done every few days.</li>
            <li> After experimenting with it, the secret is USE SPARINGLY---spray, rub, wipe off with dry towel.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m at the point where I feel very little, if at all tingling.  </li>
            <li> She has noticed very little itching ...</li>
            <li> I really have nothing bad to say about.</li>
            <li> and I really think it does help with sore and painful muscles and joints.  </li>
            <li> Usually, she soaks in Epsom salts, but this time she tried this oil.</li>
            <li> This I have been doing for the past week and will continue to do</li>
            <li> It would usually relieve the cramps temporarily in about 3-5 minutes.</li>
            <li> No more leg or muscle cramps.</li>
            <li> If your on the fence about this product, wait and contemplate no more.</li>
            <li> My magnesium levels (via blood test) have been checked in the past four months are are ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so no more feet.  </li>
            <li> that has a faint scent of low tide...</li>
            <li> Just not sure if I noticed a difference yet.</li>
            <li> After about one week no more cramps.</li>
            <li> If the product intrigues you, I&#x27;d say go for it because of the guarantee.s usual to get the residue</li>
            <li> There were  warnings it might cause itching or other side effects, but I have not experienced anything like that.</li>
            <li> I am spraying a fairly new, but painful hip replacement.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had an issue with itching, but I typically have a burning sensation, worse on some parts of my body than others.  </li>
            <li> I also have an issue sleeping at night, I can fall asleep fine, but, staying asleep is a problem and sleeping medication, even Melatonin, gives me terrible dreams</li>
            <li> to the point that it&#x27;s hard to sleep.  </li>
            <li> This product is not effective, it does not ease the pain.</li>
            <li> Helpful for my slow digestion issues.</li>
            <li> That usually takes about a&lt;br /&gt;week!  </li>
            <li> I have a digestive disorder and this magnesium oil by-passes the digestive tract without the unpleasant side effects of regular oral magnesium.</li>
            <li> The smell should be noted; it has an unpleasant smell, like mold, so I will definitely not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I had an area on my right calf that was inexplicably sore, almost painful, when rubbed.  </li>
            <li> wife has a bad back and did some gardening this weekend that resulted in sore muscles.</li>

            <li> After that, the area was a bit numb for a few days.  </li>
            <li> Not what I needed when I was already tired from working all day and was in pain.  </li>
            <li> A silly thing, I cannot stand to leave it on my hands, I have to seriously wash my hands after applying...</li>
            <li> It eliminated taking any of those fake fiber products like Benefiber, that are not good for your health anyway.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I received this sample to review  for no charge.  The instruction say to spray on skin, especially feet, and gently rub in. You can wipe off the excess if desired.  When we received this, we sprayed it on our feet and rubbed it in.  It seemed &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; and not comfortable so we washed it off.  After experimenting with it, the secret is USE SPARINGLY---spray, rub, wipe off with dry towel.  Then it feels good, and seems to be good for your skin.  If you spray too much, it will dry but will remain sticky and you feel &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; and its almost a gross feeling.  Use a small amount and enjoy.</li>
            <li> Applied each evening before bed, this oil greatly relieves the nerve pain that I experience in my arms.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Good &amp;#34;moisturizer&amp;#34;; not too oily&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not sure how much magnesium I actually get when applying to my skin, but I do like the way my skin feels after I use it. This is the first topical magnesium I&#x27;ve ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;I spray my legs,  sit back with my legs resting on a foot stool and watch TV. After a half hour or so I wash them off.  It does have a weird sticky feel and a itch to it, so washing it off works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old house is very cold, so when I spray my legs with this, it feels a bit too cold in here for me. I&#x27;ll use this more when the temps warm up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this 4 stars just because I have no idea how much I&#x27;m absorbing, and I&#x27;m cold after I spray it on - no fault of the product. I&#x27;m sure the oil helps with painful muscles like I&#x27;ve read in other reviews.  I ordered this to use as a supplement to accompany my other suplements I take for my bones. Magnesioum in pill form dosnt seem to agree with me, but it would be simpler if it did.</li>
            <li> It worked just as advertised!!!</li>
            <li> Great Product and really does work!</li>
            <li> I have intermittent problems and pain with my right knee.  I bruised it very badly a couple of years ago.  Nothing I have tried eased the pain to where climbing stairs had become almost impossible.  But after using this for just four days, the pain in my knee has almost disappeared!  I am shocked but also very happy!  The &amp;#34;itchiness&amp;#34; I have experiences a couple of times is minimal!  I love this product!</li>
            <li> The product arrived within the two day shipping and I used it that night. No leg cramps. TRULY amazing when I would have gotten up 10 - 15 times a night. Saturday night same thing worked again. I used the spray again Sunday night and had one leg cramp Monday morning around 4AM and that&#x27;s fine because I get up at about that time. I used the spray Tuesday night and now it is Thursday and still no leg cramps. I certainly don&#x27;t feel I have to use it every night which is odd. But it works and it is worth every penny. Great product. I wish there were more natural remedies for every health issue.</li>
            <li> I have RLS and bought this because I heard it would help. It has. I was having a flair up and the Magnesium Oil arrived the same day it started, it worked great. Just a warning: when it dries it does sting a bit, but just run a cool wash cloth over your legs and it stops.</li>
            <li> Not only did it come exactly as expected, but I also received a nice follow up email from them checking to make sure. I would definitely order from this Seller again.  The instructions for use were clear, and so far, after just a few days, I can really notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil before bed and I think it is working.  I feel more relaxed.</li>
            <li> Works well and easy to use. Would not hesitate to buy again!</li>
            <li> Shipped on time. I am noticing some improvement regarding joint pain after almost two weeks.</li>
            <li> EDIT: I awarded Seven Minerals a second star based on exceptional customer service - within a few hours of my review going live, I had an email from Amazon telling me of my refund. No arguments or demands to return the bottle (which is the usual requirement for refunds and is often so costly to ship that it makes filing for a refund not worth it), and they even gave me some suggestions as to how I could try diluting the remaining product to see if it could be tolerable.  ORIGINAL REVIEW: [One Star] If this is supposed to be the less-irritating version, I&#x27;m not sure I even want to think about what the regular stuff is like! It does not &amp;#34;itch&amp;#34; on my skin, it BURNS - feels exactly like a bad sunburn - and it is unbelievably drying to my skin. I apply it to my lower legs and feet as directed at night and grit my teeth for 20 minutes, then I rinse it off in the shower (I shower at night, not in the morning) and slather coconut oil on the damp skin to seal in the moisture, but within a few hours my skin is dry and itchy, often enough to wake me up - I have to put on knee socks so I won&#x27;t scratch myself raw. When I get up in the morning the skin on my feet and legs feels like sandpaper and looks ashy which is pretty impressive given how pale I am, so I apply more coconut oil, but by afternoon it&#x27;s dry and rough again which is kind of the pits now that we&#x27;re really getting into shorts and sandals season! No &amp;#34;soft and supple with a healthy glow&amp;#34; going on here! Can&#x27;t imagine applying it to my hands and leaving it there, I can&#x27;t get it off my hands fast enough after rubbing it into my feet. I have kept this routine up for a little over 5 weeks hoping I would get used to it as the seller suggests but it still burns something wicked every time. I started out doing just my feet the first week or so but there was no improvement in the burning sensation so based on the seller&#x27;s claims that increasing one&#x27;s systemic magnesium levels should lessen the irritation I increased the surface area, hoping that if I just stuck it out... However, I also have had NO reduction at all in the symptoms attributed to magnesium deficiency (insomnia, anxiety, depression, irritability, muscle cramps/twitching/weakness, chronic muscle/joint pain, fatigue, etc.), although I really wanted it to work, leading me to believe that either my problems are not magnesium-related (heaven knows I&#x27;ve tried everything else though...) or this product is not the right one for me to address this issue. Nor did it help a tension headache at all when applied to the head as directed. So I&#x27;m giving up on this product, it&#x27;s just making me too miserable to continue using it and getting nothing out of it. After 2 nights of not applying it, my skin is almost back to normal with respect to the dryness.  I will give the company credit in that over a month of use has only put a very small dent in the bottle, so I expect that a bottle would last a good long time - for those who do not have problems with skin irritation, it is a very good value.</li>
            <li> September 2015 update. I reduced the rating from 5 to 4 stars because this oil can cause problems to your feet. The directions DO say to wipe it OFF of the soles of your feet. I didn&#x27;t. So for 2 weeks, every night, I sprayed it on the soles of my feet and my feet and my calves - NO foot or leg cramps for 2 weeks. HEAVEN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT then my feet felt very dry. I discovered that my feet were peeling, as if I had a sunburn. It took a month of scraping the skin off gently with a pumice stone and using moisturizing cream to get them close to normal. SO follow the instructions. The soles of your feet are very sensitive, unless they are very calloused! Spray on after bath or shower, and then blot or wipe off unless you want flaky fluttery skin on the bottom of your feet. Otherwise, this was my &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; treatment for these horrendous leg cramps I developed in the past few years!&lt;br /&gt;-----------------&lt;br /&gt;Shockingly effective! After years and years of spending money and using - Amish cider vinegar with ginger/garlic, and all the Hyland products - leg cramp cream, tablets ---------- I read something about magnesium oil. I chose the one with aloe vera because the others all said the salt content could cause itchiness.  Well, 3 days and nights later - NO leg cramps! I can&#x27;t believe it! I remain cautiously optimistic, but every night, I spray the oil on my hands and rub the soles and tops of my feet and toes. No leg cramps during the night, waking, or during the day - and I slept a little better too. Just my own experience - but I&#x27;m a believer!</li>
            <li> I have used Ancient Minerals Magnesium Oil previously, however it was quite itchy which is a sign my body was definitely needing the extra magnesium. The Seven Minerals Magnesium Oil with Aloe was not nearly as itchy while being quite effective to help control pain and microspasms in my limb that has chronic circulation issues. Additionally spraying repeatedly every day for a few days quickly resolved a fungal issue, as well. Win-Win! This bottle was supplied free of charge, this is my honest experience after using this bottle for several weeks.</li>
            <li> I just cannot seem to be able to leave it on long enough to see if it helps.... it just starts itching me and irritating me so much that I must wash it off.  I was so hoping this one with aloe would help with that....</li>
            <li> The magnesium oil with aloe vera worked really well to help build up my magnesium level and also soften skin.</li>
            <li> Works. I ran out of my magnesium glycinate supplement and luckily had just received this in the mail because I had wanted to try it. I sprayed on bottoms of my feet a couple times a day. I tried to spray on my legs after a shower but it was itchy. I know I am deficient in magnesium so that is Prob why. Works good on bottoms of feet though if you want to take less mag pills or would rather spray your feet instead. Does take a minute or so to dry. I use essential oils a lot on my feet though, so not sure I want to always use this spray but a good alternative to pills.</li>
            <li> I have sprayed this product every night for about 2 weeks on my feet and didn&#x27;t notice any difference. I am disappointed that it didn&#x27;t work for me after hearing all of the good reviews.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good product getting more accustom to your skin getting irritated  which is a lack of magnesium</li>
            <li> I believe this is making a difference in sleeping for me. I spray it on after a shower, rub it in, taking care to get it on the bottom of my feet and sometimes I put some on my face. It does have a curious feeling going on your skin. It&#x27;s not so much itchy as buzzy (best word for me). That stops after awhile. I do not feel the need to moisturize over it. I&#x27;m going to keep using it.</li>
            <li> Magnesium Oil with ALOE VERA by Seven Minerals was incredible. I have grade 4 osteoarthritis in both knees and am fighting knee replacements as I have already had 4 back surgeries and I&#x27;m just not ready to go down the long road of recovery yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I had heard stories about Magnesium being a pain reliever but I had always assumed they were referring to it as aneeded oral vitamin/mineral type thing, but when I saw it here on Amazon as I was looking for some Badger Balm, I saw that I could use it topically, applying it with a spray bottle so I didn&#x27;t have to get my hands wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The absolute best part is this. The squirting of magnesium spray I put on my knees for arthritis,  and later on my lower legs for neuropathy did more for my knee and leg pain than anything my pain management doctor or orthopedist had ever managed to do. My leg pain wasn&#x27;t gone, but it was at its lowest level in quite some time. It is so awesome to have another item in my pain management tool box that doesn&#x27;t involve a pill that must circulate systematically through my body when in reality,  and Magnesium spray would be the best solution.  Maybe not every time, but, like I said....it&#x27;s another very effective tool in my pain management tool box.</li>
            <li> It works well.  However, mine was delivered without the top.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;The seller sent a nice email before the product came with additional information on how to use it. They also sent a follow up letter. This product has been a huge help already in providing relief from night leg cramps. It does feel a tiny bit sticky, but the relief it gives far out weighs any residual feeling which you can wash off anyway. This product goes a long way, I will replace it as needed.&amp;#34; And last night I rubbed some on the bottom of my feet as they also suggest, and I slept through the entire night. That hasn&#x27;t happened in a very long time!</li>
            <li> I have had a wrist injury for about a year and have used various devices, supplements, etc. to try to heal it. To be honest, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this product. However, after using it for a couple days, I can honestly say that my wrist is less sore. It&#x27;s not totally healed, but the pain is more bearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has a bad back and did some gardening this weekend that resulted in sore muscles. Usually, she soaks in Epsom salts, but this time she tried this oil. She loves this stuff now and is convinced it worked as well as or better than the Epsom bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s plenty in the bottle, so it should last a long time. I noticed no scent. It leaves a slight residue, but I didn&#x27;t experience any itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is definitely worth a try if you have chronic pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I received a free sample in exchange for a fair and honest review.</li>
            <li> This is quite a product!  I apply to my feet twice a day and I am amazed how my joints are less achy, especially my feet.  I have been a runner/speed walker for years and the feet are reminding me. I apply in the morning, put my socks on, go to work ( I am a nurse) and my feet feel so much better. I apply before bed. Great product!</li>
            <li> This seems to make a difference in the aching of hand joints, etc...  EXPECT it to be ITCHY!!  Although it has the ALOE VERA in it, still is ITCHY when first applied.  As it&#x27;s itching, I find myself rubbing it in more.  I don&#x27;t have to WASH it OFF though, as it quits itching in about 30 minutes.  I have found that if you put this on your feet, they will be gunky feeling- if you don&#x27;t put socks on.  So, I quit putting on bottoms of feet, just spray a bit around ankles, then around different areas of the body.  If you spray on upper part of INSIdE of legs, expect your legs to be sticky feeling for a bit.  After 20 minutes or so, you can use a baby powder, and gets smooth again (without washing off).  I like it best when used on areas that don&#x27;t rub together, so use on outside of  arms, front of legs, stomach, buttocks, even chest.  But again, WILL itch for a bit, and you&#x27;ll find yourself rubbing it.. Since I have some thumb joint pain, I rub it in, using back of my hands, to get even more into my hand joints (and fingers)  You&#x27;ll need to wash the tips of your fingers, as will BURN your eyes!!!  I&#x27;ve never applied this to my face!!!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! I am using it on a daily basis, sometimes several times a day &amp; am actually sleeping through the night! It has helped alleviate my leg cramping, it has helped with my bad neck &amp; stiff shoulders…I love this product &amp; only wish I had found out about it sooner!</li>
            <li> Great product. Seems to have helped with my headaches.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a couple of days but it seems to deliver what it promises: Aloe and Magneisum.  I&#x27;m not sure at all how that&#x27;s supposed to get through my skin which is a natural protector against all things outside of my body, but I&#x27;m trusting my grandmother who kept trying to get me hooked into Epsom Salts (great but Grandma, I don&#x27;t have a bath tub!)  Next best thing was this spray which I think logically would work better than a bath anyway and I can use everyday with great convenience.  I am low on magnesium and also take supplements, I&#x27;m feeling better but do not know which is working.  My biggest complaint is extreme fatigue.  I also have some bone / muscle soreness so maybe it will help that given some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Itch:  I guess it&#x27;s a little prickly.  It wasn&#x27;t as bad as say a rash or a flea bite, it was more like just shaven legs or maybe wearing wool fabric. Maybe not as bad as wearing wool.  Really it didn&#x27;t bother me and for the benefits - worth it.</li>
            <li> I took 4 bottles , I nearly finished 1 , maybe there is slight effect, I&#x27;ll still continue using it</li>
            <li> It works!  a couple of sprays on the bottoms of my and my wife&#x27;s feet, a couple of sprays on our belly&#x27;s and we&#x27;re sleeping better than we have in years!</li>
            <li> It is a nice oil.  It comes in handy for painful legs especially those with fibromyalgia.  Good for dry skin, too.</li>
            <li> First time user of topical magnesium, and I do not think I will ever be without it!  I have suffered from chronic muscle pain (poly myalgia, polymyocitis) for 2+ years and  I am convinced that this is helping.  I have been applying 1-2 times a day for about 3 weeks and my leg and back muscles are better!  Only occasional pain.&lt;br /&gt;The feel to my skin is tolerable -esp since it decreases my pain.  A silly thing, I cannot stand to leave it on my hands, I have to seriously wash my hands after applying...try it!  I hope it helps you too.</li>
            <li> Magnesium without taking horse size pills! I put this on sometimes during the day, but always at night. I have Lyme disease, fibromyalgia, heart disease &amp; peripheral neuropathy. The spray goes on &amp; you rub it in like an oil, but it&#x27;s not oily. The skin feels a little tight, but I have not itched at all. The info on this product said...maybe itching, but I have had none.&lt;br /&gt;It has helped my leg &amp; foot pain a lot.&lt;br /&gt;My husband&#x27;s right hand suddenly started hurting &amp; was swollen. I sprayed &amp; rubbed it in his hand and he said it really helped. We&#x27;re in our 60&#x27;s &amp; any help is a relief!</li>
            <li> seems to work the way the company says it does</li>
            <li> Initially I purchased this for my 5 yr old. I got her all excited about using it, we called it her &amp;#34;pixie dust spray&amp;#34; and everything. However, she couldn&#x27;t tolerate the itching/burning sensation that you get after applying it. I was able to get her to use it a couple more times afterwards, but it&#x27;s simply not worth her crying and jumping around. I have used it a couple of times myself and I too am too sensitive to use it. I will be sending it back.</li>
            <li> AWSOMEI have just ordered my 5th bottle This stuff and seller are TOP of the line!  My husband is on his 3rd bottle. 4 years ago he was diagnosed with a multiple myeloma tumor inside his spine as the tumor grew it caused cracks in his spine.We finally found a product that helps to relieve the pain as well as other muscular aches and pain! Amazing and wonderful! &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The product was delivered on time.So far it does all it is advertised to be. There was a slight stinging sensation  on one arm the first two times I used to but I noticed I had a scratch on that arm.</li>
            <li> Magnesium is certainly a fascinating nutrient! As far as supplementation goes, many studies have found that transdermal magnesium chloride, such as found in this Magnesium Oil by Seven Mineral that I receives as a gift, are the most highly absorbable and effective way to get magnesium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the pain of sports injuries to low-back pain and sciatica, headaches, relief from kidney stones, the pain of restless legs, arthritic pain, and just about every painful condition imaginable--all will in all likelihood benefit from magnesium applied topically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having suffered from excruciating migraines for years... with them getting steadily worse in intensity and frequency over time - I will try anything! My migraines are so debilitating I have had an MRI just to make sure there was nothing else causing the severe pain, this came back clear. The doctor has tried me on many types of medications - all of which made me quite unwell to say the least, but I was so desperate I had to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been applying Magnesium oil for a few days and I had a bad migraine the first day I started using it. Shortly after I sprayed my skin with magnesium oil, I felt stinging, tingling, but nothing that can&#x27;t be tolerated. To my surprise, I found I did not get the terrible pain behind my eyes during this migraine attack. Part of me is excited, as I really want this to be the answer to my years of pain and part of me is still very cautious that the answer to my problems could be so simple!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I can tell, I have low magnesium levels as it stings for a while after application, as it should. I certainly will continue to use this product and hopefully, my migraines get milder and I have a lot more good day than bad days.</li>
            <li> It helps me relax and sleep..I thought it might be my imagination, but I went away this weekend and didn&#x27;t take it with me..I didn&#x27;t sleep as well. I spray it on before get into bed at night and I seems to not only help me fall asleep,but stay asleep.</li>
            <li> Hmmm, not sure if it really works for the purpose</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I really like this product. I have a digestive disorder and this magnesium oil by-passes the digestive tract without the unpleasant side effects of regular oral magnesium. Spray it all over and air dry. It is a little itchy, but not bad. A very good product that I would definitely recommend if you have had problems with oral magnesium that causes digestive disturbances.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This mag oil seems potent and eases muscle spasms in my lower back.  I guess it&#x27;s the aloe that makes it smell like onions, that&#x27;s the only reason I can&#x27;t give this product 5 stars.  Plus, I haven&#x27;t found that the aloe minimizes the stinging/itchiness that mag oil causes in sensitive areas like the chest, neck, and shoulders.</li>
            <li> This has really been helping with my restless legs at night. Good product!</li>
            <li> I think most people are lacking magnesium, so this is an easy way to add it to our lives.</li>
            <li> Magnesium Oil with ALOE VERA (Makes it less itchy) Big 12Oz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color me a skeptic. I was going along trying to figure out how to review this product. I sprayed it on the soles of my feet and on my legs. I did not have the dreaded itchy reaction, so that was good. I have a patch of rashy type skin on my upper thigh so I sprayed that. I didn&#x27;t notice any great change on my lower legs but had started to notice the rash area getting less so. In a few days it subsided. I took that to be a good thing and used nothing else in this area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the review Gods struck me. A couple of days ago I woke up with essentially no right knee. I was in pain and could barely put any weight on my leg. I must have slept on my knee funny and did something to it. I was fine at 2AM and in torture at 7AM, I was up at 2. My first instinct was a pain med and I took Advil, three of them. It helped but I was still in pain and thanks to having recently reviewed a cane able to at least get around my apartment. I wasn&#x27;t in any condition to drive and get to a doctor. Then I remembered the Magnesium Oil spray. I thought, here&#x27;s a test, I have this and I&#x27;m going to see if it can handle real pain. I sprayed down my knee let it dry and patted dry the rest of the moisture left. I remembered I have a knee brace and found it and also put that on. I started a regimen of applying the Magnesium spray every three to four hours while I was awake.  I reduced my Advil intake and toughed it out. I did sleep through the next night and awoke to my knee not hurting nearly as much. I&#x27;m still spraying and using the knee brace. I&#x27;m down to one Advil and will probably cease that if the pain keeps diminishing as it has. I&#x27;m able to put a lot more weight on my knee and walk with the cane just as a balance aide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now a day and a half in and feel much better. I&#x27;m feeling stronger, but not fully well yet. I walked outside my apartment today and can I credit the Magnesium spray? I am. The other parts certainly helped but I think the speed of the healing is a direct relationship to what I sprayed on my knee. The rash has cleared up too. I&#x27;ll amend this if anything changes for the worse, right now I&#x27;m thrilled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided at no cost for the purpose of evaluation and review.t I think the speed of the healing is a direct relationship to what I sprayed on my knee.

            <li> I had a terrible uncontrollable itchy reaction. I bought this brand after reading all the reviews and thought that the aloe would reduce this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking Magnesium supplements for years, but had never heard of Magnesium Oil until I was offered this Seven Minerals product to test and review.  From reading the product info and reviews some people experienced itching, but I did not, perhaps because mine was enriched with Aloe Vera.  I have been using it for about two weeks daily, spraying some problem areas as well as the soles of my feet.  Although difficult to give exact analysis, I believe it is working well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil does not feel at all oily, in fact, when it goes on it feels strangely dry, but leaves your skin feeling smooth, sort of slick. There is no discernible odor or color.  In the winter, I tend to be a bit arthritic in a few joints, so I routinely sprayed those areas like my knees and hands.  I feel some immediate relief.  I know it may sound strange, but it makes you feel like it is really beneficial.  Occasionally I treat myself to a massage and will be sure to bring this along to be added to the massage oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 12oz bottle should last a pretty long time making it cost effective.  I also like the fact it is made in the USA and the product has natural magnesium and organic Aloe Vera.  There is a wealth of information online about magnesium oil and it&#x27;s benefits.  Magnesium Oil with Aloe has been added to my daily supplement regimen.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This truly is a miracle product. I know that sounds corny but it&#x27;s true. I have scoliosis and a lot of back pain that goes along with that. Spraying the magnesium oil on my hot spots works immediately. It especially helps on my neck on very painful days.&lt;br /&gt;I was so happy with this product that I made little spray bottles to share with friends and family.</li>
            <li> Love it, spray bottle makes it so easy to use</li>
            <li> If you are short on magnesium, and have muscle cramps, this may be the right product for you. I&#x27;m taking a medication that has a side effect of causing muscle cramps everywhere, and this magnesium oil really helps. The aloe vera helps with the itching you get from the oil, which is also a real plus. Until I started using this stuff I didn&#x27;t think there was anything that would help. And my son, who has suffered with restless leg syndrome for years, finally got some relief and slept through the night peacefully after rubbing his legs and feet with this stuff. He tried the regular oil but it was too itchy for him, so he switched to the aloe vera version and hasn&#x27;t had much in the way of itching with it. Thumbs up for a great product!</li>
            <li> Before I accepted the Magnesium Oil for review I went online and found literally dozens of articles telling me about the benefits of using magnesium to heal a host of medical issues.  It appears that as many as 80% of the American public are magnesium deficient.  How do you know if you are deficient in magnesium?  Here are a few common signs that you may need more magnesium: anxiety, high blood pressure, fatigue, difficulty sleeping, poor memory, confusion....  And there are more.  My guess is that anyone reading this review will want to do what I did and that is go online and do some research on the subject of the importance of magnesium for our health and well being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I went to Amazon to see what books were available on the subject of magnesium and it turns out there are many.  I stopped counting at 12.  I downloaded on my Kindle Max Sircus&#x27;s book on Transdermal Magnesium Therapy and what I learned on the Internet was well supported in Sircus&#x27;s book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try out the Magnesium Oil and Aloe Vera for myself.  I used one of the suggestions in Max Sircus&#x27;s book, that is, soak my feet for twenty minutes with warm water and a bit less than an ounce of the magesium oil with aloe vera.  This I have been doing for the past week and will continue to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the experience of the foot soak is most pleasant after a busy day.  After twenty minutes my feet feel relaxed and the numbness left over from a bad bout with sciatica is much improved.  Just as suggested by Sircus and many others, the foot soak with magnesium is a good thing to do at night to promote restful sleep.  It works for me.  I&#x27;m not sure what long term benefits will follow from this practice, but I can see no downside to the foot soak practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oil comes in a twelve ounce plastic bottle with a spray top.  It has a light and pleasant smell.  I am pleased to have received this product and will continue using it.  In a month or so I will update this review and give readers my report on long term advantages of using magnesium oil with aloe vera.my report on long term advantages of using magnesium oil with aloe vera.</li>
            <li> ok, but makes my skin itch</li>
            <li> I was amazed.  I had a muscle tightness in the back of my knee, I sprayed the oil on and the pain was gone within a few minutes.  I also had a big toe pain for  2 weeks.  I soaked my feet in hot water and sprayed the oil in water.  The next day the pain was gone.  I will definitely recommend this to all my achey friends!!!!</li>
            <li> My husband had a heart transplant and had terrible cramps from the anti  rejection drugs  causing low magnesium numbers. These cramps were awful. We used the ALOE VERA Magnesium Oil and it was very helpful for relief. It would usually relieve the cramps temporarily in about 3-5 minutes. Usually the cramps would not return for  several hours. But with the medications always changing the bodies electrolytes were always changing also, we also used Viva Labs Magnesium Bisecylcinate 200mg.which helped the magnesium be  absorbed.</li>
            <li> seems to help circulation near the surface.  Worthwhile product and great people to deal with.</li>
            <li> I have already written a review on how great magnesium with aloe vera really works, now to extend my comment, I have a 92 year old mother in law with aches and pains all over, and since my wife has been rubbing her mothers sore body with they magnesium oil , it has significantly dropped her pain level ,as well as my wife who has restless leg syndrome ,and since we have been using this on her legs she has finally been able to get the sleep she needs and deserves so badly .once again thank you very much for your product it is wonderful ,and I would gladly be a spokesperson for this particular product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I will def buy it again.</li>
            <li> A friend from work suggested I tried the Magnesium Oil with Aloe Vera for my sore knees.  I started jogging and this was causing my knees to be sore.  I decided to give it a try and I was pleasantly surprised.  I started a week ago to apply it to the bottom of my feet and directly to my knees and it has been working great, my knees are not sore anymore and I feel more relaxed.  At night time I rest better and I&#x27;ve been able to get a better night sleep.  I do want to mention that when I apply it to my knees I have an itchy sensation at first, once the solution dries the itch goes away, it&#x27;s not uncomfortable at all but I wanted to mentioned so that this doesn&#x27;t discourage anyone from using it, it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wanted to mention that I received the product very quickly Seven Minerals shipped it fast and the service was excellent.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! I get terrible cramps in my feet as well as restless legs and this is such a great relief to me at night. I use a little in the morning after my shower and a generous amount at night before bed. I have finally found something that gives me relief. The only negative is s slight burning sensation, but it&#x27;s not uncomfortable and doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> We had gotten this promptly in the mail. The plastic cover was cracked and taped on though. When we use it our body feels relaxed and I mix it with lotion for the kids and put it on there feet and stomach before bed to help them rest. It does tingle and burn a little bit  at first but goes away and after repeated use it doesn&#x27;t burn anymore. It&#x27;s not really an oil but magnesium water with aloe Vera.  Well purchase again when finished with the bottle.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. it seems to help with my restless leg</li>
            <li> love this - the addition of aloe makes it not itch and less sticky</li>
            <li> Well... I was very apprehensive about trying it but I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I spray it on my knees each a.m. and rub plenty in.  Yes it does itch some but after a few minutes I spay on some lotion and rub that in too.  The itch goes away and I&#x27;m ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;One knee is a TKR and has caused me pain and swelling for the last 7 years.&lt;br /&gt;The oil actually does... (after a few days) seem to calm down the pain... taking the edge off and also reduces the swelling and&lt;br /&gt;sensitivity.  On my other knee, which I recently sprained... I rubbed in the oil and it resolved within 2 days.  That usually takes about a&lt;br /&gt;week!  So yes I do like this magnesium oil with aloe vera.  Give it a try!  After all they say that your body has over 400 uses for magnesium... so it can only help.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I purchased this product. It has made a difference in my health. I will buy this again and again.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product that truly helps your body.  This company has wonderful online information about their products.  I learned so much and had so many questions about fluid magnesium answered by reading the articles the company posts online.  Thank you very much for all the information, and for making such a wonderful product with such care and deliberation.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Magnesium in all its forms so I was excited to try the Magnesium Oil body spray by Seven Minerals.  It really seemed to help my aches and pains but I did notice some itchiness on my sensitive skin.  The company suggested I try this product instead.  The aloe vera added takes away most of the itchiness and makes the spray more moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product for anyone who wants to use magnesium oil but has sensitive skin, this will be very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product for review purposes and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Even though I still get a little itchy, I am in love with this product! I&#x27;ve been recommending it non-stop! I feel better, more balanced and energized than I did before using it. Beware you will feel like you just got out of the ocean after spraying yourself. I recommend spraying an hour before bed, chilling out for 30 minutes then rinsing off in a quick shower before hopping between the sheets.</li>
            <li> A good way to get your magnesium for those of us who need to supplement but get digestive issues if we take the pills. If you spray on right after your shower it stings like crazy. Best to use a few minutes before. Leaves a slightly sticky residue that really isn&#x27;t noticeable and goes away in a bit.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve only been using the product for a couple of weeks.  I don&#x27;t experience any of the itching, that other reviewers have mentioned.  I am spraying a fairly new, but painful hip replacement.  I think it helps tremendously.  I&#x27;m an insomniac….my doctor suggested taking magnesium before bed because it might help me sleep.  I take a pill and i spray the bottom of my feet with magnesium oil. My next attempt is to try it as an antiperspirant.  I&#x27;ve read lots of positive reviews…..to me, it&#x27;s worth a try…..the chemicals aren&#x27;t working, so why not try something natural?  If you&#x27;ve any questions, the customer service department is on top of everything and I&#x27;m sure they would be willing to work with you.  I did not have to contact customer service for any reason.  They were nice enough to follow through with my purchase and make sure I was 100% satisfied.  That alone, says I&#x27;ll purchase from them again.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and best part is the customer service from the company that sells it.  It makes my legs ever so slightly itchy the day after I use it, so I don&#x27;t use it daily.  But it moisturizers my skin when I apply it.  It&#x27;s not too greasy and hasn&#x27;t stained anything.</li>
            <li> I sleep so much better since I bought this! I only put some on the inside of my arms right before bed and I&#x27;m out real quick. I was having some trouble with falling and staying asleep prior to using this but, now I sleep like a rock.</li>
            <li> No more leg or muscle cramps. I am also using it to lower my cholesterol, so I will check those labs in a month. Hopefully it has worked.</li>
            <li> I had an area on my right calf that was inexplicably sore, almost painful, when rubbed.  I used a few squirts a day for 3-4 days, rubbing it in with a washcloth.  There was some very minor itchiness one day.  After that, the area was a bit numb for a few days.  The problem is now gone.  No smell issue for me.  I&#x27;m now ready for other problems, should they arise.  So far, I&#x27;m a believer.</li>
            <li> Good way to get the magnesium to the body, now when we are concern about low magnesium in our diet.</li>
            <li> Works great so far. Non-greasy and absorbs into the skin well.</li>
            <li> I have been using magnesium oil for several months.  I definitely think it works to help relieve aches and pains and as a sleep aid, but the stinging sensation bothered me, especially on my legs after I shaved.  With this product, the stinging is gone!  It is important to note that this product is only 75% of the strength of the oil without the added aloe vera, so you may want to use more sprays at a time.</li>
            <li> it really seems to help me sleep betterand have more energy which is basically what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I was told Magnesium Oil would alleviate leg cramps. It did! I hadn&#x27;t tried any other brand so I can&#x27;t compare one from the other. I chose this because aloe vera couldn&#x27;t hurt. I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars but I&#x27;m not crazy about the pump spray. It&#x27;s a tall bottle and pumping with a fingertip gets a bit unweildy. I am going to transfer this to an empty bottle with a trigger spray.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I really have nothing bad to say about. My skin still itches every time I use it, however, it is not bad enough to make me stop using. It leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product</li>
            <li> NOT convinced that it works as advertised.  I have not witnessed any results for myself in using this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a while now and I really think it does help with sore and painful muscles and joints.  I have been using it after a workout and after a shower.  I do spray it on and let it air dry as much as possible...I do rub it in to knees...and that seems to be working at making my knees less pain filled.  It doesn&#x27;t have a scent at all...if it does it is mild and dissipates.  I keep it in my basket of body lotions and potions and my new routine is to spray away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the addition of aloe to it...I have read that some people experience itchiness after using but that has not been my experience at all.  I think that this is a product that I will continue using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My thank you to the manufacturer for providing me with this product!</li>
            <li> This is great stuff for cramping muscle relief.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had restless legs for 15 years and was VERY skeptical.  But I discovered that soft water lacks magnesium and I live in a soft water area.  So I tried it and will stay on it for the rest of my life.  Oral magnesium makes me vomit but this stuff doesn&#x27;t and the itchy feeling they talk about actually feels good to my fibromyalgia.  I put it on my back, legs, and soles of my feet after my bath every evening, let it air dry, and leave it on until the next evening&#x27;s bath.  As long as this stuff keeps working, I&#x27;m going to keep buying.</li>
            <li> I do love your products and am very pleased with the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Namaste!&lt;br /&gt;Pamela</li>
            <li> Seams to work prity good</li>
            <li> I have restless legs syndrome and read that magnesium oil would help calm my legs at night. I find I sleep better since using this product. There were  warnings it might cause itching or other side effects, but I have not experienced anything like that. I use a Fitbit to monitor the quality of my sleep and my sleep efficiency has improved. Zzzzzzzz...</li>
            <li> Absolutely a miracle in a bottle!  love this stuff!! stops my jumpy restless legs within 5  minutes !!!! LOVE IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;Be warned though:  DO NOT put this on after shaving!  OMG!  OUCH! I didn&#x27;t even think about it until I sprayed it on my legs... and proceeded to go thru the roof!  My bad!&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff!! I plan on keeping some of this around for the jumpy legs, but its also great for sleepy night night jammies.</li>
            <li> Nice product, I use it every day after I shower. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks.  It is very easy to apply and I have not experienced any burning for itching .&lt;br /&gt;I am using it due to muscle spasms and muscle soreness.  I think it is too early to rate how well it is working for me .  I need to use it for&lt;br /&gt;a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what I needed it to do: STOPS my headaches that travel up my neck and into my scalp.  The addition of aloe vera helps counteract the itchy dryness the mineral solution causes.  My herbalist turned me on to this solution, and this is the best produced product I have found</li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t say the magnesium oil has helped with aches and pains, I have gotten some relief with RLS. I have been researching magnesium and decided it was a vital mineral that I wasn&#x27;t getting enough of. While I take a supplement, I read only 4% may get to your system so decided to try this; a very convenient way to make sure it all goes where needed. I tried spraying it in various places but am just now spraying it on my feet, twice a day, once before bedtime. It does seem to be successful in helping me go to sleep so I am not taking Melatonin as much. Regardless of what one may use it for, I believe it is a good way to get added magnesium. It was itchy the first time I used it but I just rinsed it off after 20 min and it hasn&#x27;t bothered me since, though as I said, I just use it on the feet now. The feet is supposed to be the gateway to all vital organs. I will be buying this again as it&#x27;s worth the price of relief of RLS. ( Restless Leg Syndrome)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I should rate this four or five stars.  I learned about Magnesium Oil reading a book on how to sleep better.  I don&#x27;t know if it is snake oil and I just want it to work or if it really works.  I&#x27;d have to say that I think it does work.  Nothing dramatic but it seems to work.  I rub it on my shoulders on front and back, on my upper chest and pretty much all my arms after a hard work out.  Usually by the next morning my muscles feel better.  The oil stings a little when I put it on certain muscles but passes very quickly for me.  It seems to smell pleasant.  I plan to buy more.</li>
            <li> This really does help me to sleep more deeply. As instructed, I spray it on my feet and lower legs up to my knees at night.</li>
            <li> This product is okay. I think I personally would prefer a lotion. After a shower, just dry off and spray it on. It does leave a residue so I wipe the sprayed areas with a damp cloth. I bought this to see if  it would help the muscle cramps I get and I think it has helped but they&#x27;re definitely not gone.</li>
            <li> Seems good thus far. Not itchy.</li>
            <li> I spray my skin right after a shower when my skin is still moist...can&#x27;t stop touching my skin because when it dries my skin feels so soft &amp; supple</li>
            <li> Interesting product.  I have been spraying it all over after showers and have come to like the tingle knowing that magesium is being absorbed.  Hopefully better muscle and heart health results.</li>
            <li> I have Chronic Lyme Disease which causes a lot of leg pain,  I spray the magnesium on my legs &amp; rub it in &amp; the pain subsides,</li>
            <li> Seven minerals magnesium, not only was it an awesome product but the company itself went above and beyond to ensure any expectations were completely and full heartedly fulfilled. If your on the fence about this product, wait and contemplate no more. I&#x27;ll say it again...Awesome!!</li>
            <li> Used it on bottom of my feet, sprayed into my hand(s) &amp; put on hip joints &amp; knees, &amp; takes about 15 min for numbing of pain to kick in.  Had 1-2 hours of relief.</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing!  My new massage therapist recommended this oil, said the magnesium is good for aches and pains, sore muscles, cramping.  It&#x27;s better than I could have imagined.  I rub some on my achy neck after looking over a drafting table for a few hours and instantly my neck feels better.  I don&#x27;t know how it can possibly do what it does.  The oil is light and disappears quickly into my skin.  Great product, don&#x27;t even hesitate.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for muscle cramps, bruises and tension headaches! I have restless leg syndrome, and I rub on my legs before I get into a hot bath every night. It is a little bit sticky, but it&#x27;s completely worth it!</li>
            <li> This is the best by far!!  Relieves faster that my meds! Amazing product</li>
            <li> The aloe definitely reduces the sting.</li>
            <li> Love this.  I feel better after rubbing it on and I like the convenience of the spray bottle.  I don&#x27;t want to mix my own. I put it on after a nightly shower on the larger/fatty parts of my body.</li>
            <li> Waking in the middle of the night with leg cramps is horrible.  This product works wonders.  I just spray it on, massage it in and the cramps are gone. It is like a miracle.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t smell wonderful. It has an acrid smell that sticks even after the product dries. I returned mine, but the company was very gracious about the return.</li>
            <li> An Amazing Product.  I couldn&#x27;t take Magnesium orally, so by taking via transdermal is helping me absorb magnesium.</li>
            <li> All I can say is I love it...and my body loves it...  It feels good on my skin and helps me relax.&lt;br /&gt;I am suffering from lower back pain and pain in my legs.  I use it on both my back and legs.&lt;br /&gt;I am under going Sacroiliac joint injections  and just recently received Radio frequency neuro ablation&lt;br /&gt;on the lower three vertibraes in the lumbar region.&lt;br /&gt;I can say I am using it and loving it..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bobbie</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  Simply spray on soles of feet, as directed, and wipe off excess 20 min. later, and you&#x27;re done!  Great stuff, and blood levels for magnesium returned to normal after just 3 days.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> noticeably helped husband&#x27;s aching feet and my muscle spasms</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say how it works but it does. lol, Hoping one day to find a gallon size bottle. No need to take oral drug any more. Thanks</li>
            <li> Worked very good for me.&lt;br /&gt;would reorder it in the future.</li>
            <li> It seems that magnesium with aloe Vera doesn&#x27;t mix well, it has a bad smell of smelly feet stink too high heaven even though it has its good benefits</li>
            <li> I have been suffering back pain for months and taking ibuprofen like M&amp;M&#x27;s. Twenty four hrs after rubbing this oil into my back my pain is for the most part gone! I was skeptical but it really worked.  Now I rub it in twice a day and spray the soles of my feet at night. I am a believer!</li>
            <li> This product is the real deal, very concentrated magnesium chloride and I like that it is sourced from nature. It was a little too much for me as just a soothing oil but definitely helped the restless leg syndrome.</li>
            <li> I take magnesium supplements to help alleviate threats like heart disease, stroke, osteoporosis and diabetes.  As I&#x27;m not much of a pill taker, I switched to liquid, but then progressed to magnesium oil for better transdermal absorption.  I like this form, but find it leaves my skin feeling itchy.  Seven Minerals gave me a free sample of magnesium oil with aloe vera to try, and I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s a great solution.  Applying to the soles of my feet works best, but I&#x27;ve used it elsewhere and find little to no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The salt used in Seven Minerals is sourced from the Great Salt Lake.  I was concerned about possible mercury contamination and contacted the company about their purification process.  What a surprise to get an immediate response with detailed information, including testing analysis from their supplier.  This product is free of organic volatile impurities and heavy metal detection is insignificant (less than 0.001%).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I&#x27;ve used magnesium oil with aloe vera, and I&#x27;m impressed.  It&#x27;s a little pricey, but the 12 oz. bottle lasts a long time and I love the convenience of a spray bottle that works well.</li>
            <li> Worked on mom&#x27;s headache, and my leg/got cramps</li>
            <li> I was especially interested in trying out this natural magnesium oil with aloe vera pain relief remedy on an elderly family member (now 92 years young!) who suffers from much discomfort and neuropathic pain associated with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) in both lower extremities. I was already familiar with the skin/joint benefits of taking oral aloe vera capsules over an extended period of time (NatureCity Organic TrueAloe 200 mg capsules: 2 capsules twice daily for several years) and wanted to see whether magnesium would provide any additional mitigation of pain and discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daily application of this magnesium chloride (USP – United States Pharmacopeia) preparation in its large 12-ounce unbreakable plastic spray bottle either before or after bathing/showering, is a simple task indeed. It can be sprayed on the entire body with particular attention being paid to those areas that are painful/causing problems and the bottom of the feet, recommended by the manufacturer. Air drying is recommended afterwards before continuing to go about your daily business. The slight salt residue which is occasionally noticed on the skin is not bothersome and can be readily wiped off if desired; post-application skin itchiness was not a problem for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now diligently been using this remedy on the aforementioned old-timer for nearly three weeks and although I cannot claim to have noticed any additional pain relief for his lower leg problems and other bodily aches so far (most likely not related to a magnesium-deficiency), this combination of magnesium oil and aloe vera has provided an overall soothing, softening effect on his often irritated skin and has resulted in him being more relaxed and sleeping somewhat better at night. Specifically, there is less of a tendency for him to awaken several times during the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is certainly worth purchasing to see what if anything it might do for you since the manufacturer does provide a 100%, no questions asked, money back guarantee for 360 days if you are not satisfied for any reason. Should you not quite achieve the desired level of pain relief, this natural remedy may still prove more than adequately beneficial to your health by mitigating skin problems and facilitating a noticeably better night’s sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that the manufacturer provided me with a complimentary sample for this hopefully unbiased review.s provide a 100%, no questions asked, money back guarantee for 360 days if you are not satisfied for any reason.

            <li> Excellent product and results</li>
            <li> I bought this to try on an achy elbow I think I injured using a weight machine on my first (and last) day at a gym.  I&#x27;ve also been using it on my feet and calves at night for leg cramps.  Seems to have cured these two problems :)</li>
            <li> What can I say, helps me with the pain I&#x27;m happy with this product, thanks</li>
            <li> Given To Me For An Honest Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Magnesium Oil with Aloe Vera by Seven Minerals I wasn&#x27;t sure about.  When I was told it was really good and would I try it and review it, I thought yeah right.  Well I accepted a sample.  What can I say but OMG!!! This is the best thing I have ever tried and will continue to use. It is so simple to use.  Spray is on, then rub it on the areas where you are having pain.  There is no scent.  The aloe leaves skin so soft. It is great for leg cramps, painful muscles, joints and just anywhere your body is exhibiting pain.  If you are having trouble getting to sleep or sleeping through the night, no problem .... spray some on the inside of your arms right before bed then you&#x27;ll wake up in the morning feeling rested.  Chronic pain?  Then try it.  I had none of the itching that some have talked about.  I love this product and will continue to use it faithfully.  I gave it 5 stars but sure wish I could give it many, many more.  I highly recommend it to everyone.  It would be a great gift to give to anyone and everyone.  I&#x27;ll be looking at other products by Seven Minerals.</li>
            <li> Complimentary product received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t too sure about this magnesium oil, I have never used it before but wanted to give it a try. This is a generous 12 ounce bottle with a spray top for easy application. It felt strange when I applied it,...leaving what felt like a residue on my skin, and at times I felt a bit of stinging /itching. I found if I spray a lighter misting over my skin it isn&#x27;t that bad and the more often I used it the less I felt the itching. I also used it on the bottom of my feet as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice this doing much for me, but it seemed like it worked very well helping with my husbands leg cramps and sore back. He had been getting really bad leg cramps at night, this magnesium oil has lessened his leg cramps and also seems to have brought him a bit more relief from his sore back and muscles, but that could have just been the back rub working too. I just spray a bit on his back, shoulders, and the back of his calves before bedtime and he sleeps better and wakes up feeling less achy. Before using this he would have to stand in a hot shower just to get his muscles working well enough to get his day started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I used this I searched online for information on using magnesium topically, and according to the information I read it is easily absorbed through the skin and many people have benefitted from using it. It can nourish and moisturize your skin and is a safe way to up your magnesium intake, along with providing quite a few health benefits. I will continue using this to see if we notice any more health improvements.</li>
            <li> Okay, read the back of the bottle and it will warn you that there may be some itching early on. Yep. Had that, but then things leveled out and I have had no problems since then. I am currently using it for my feet because of a problem that doctors have been puzzling over. I am not diabetic, yet the soles feel like I am being held to a flame thrower. I will keep you posted.</li>
            <li> I am a woman with MS who deals with muscle spasms.  This was something I was trying to test this product on.  My partner also has restless-legs and she tried the product too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having given the product time and hoping for the best, we did not notice any benefit.  We tried various ways of using it as instructed - on the bottom of the feet before bed as well as using it on the spot for muscle spasms or aching joints.  The consistency is oily and a bit sticky and takes some getting accustomed to.  On only one instance did I notice some &amp;#34;itchiness&amp;#34;.  My magnesium levels (via blood test) have been checked in the past four months are are ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although we really really wanted to like this product and give it 5 stars, I cannot find the benefit that I was expecting.  If it works for you, great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample to test and provide an honest opinion.  We tried it in many scenarios and for us ... did not seem to provide visible or tangible benefit.</li>
            <li> Works wonders! Will purchase again</li>
            <li> Really liked it.  I used it everyday after bath and notice my skin is so supple and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> It works well. The only drawback is a kind of itchy feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> Worked great to eleiminate long history of leg cramps related to low magnesium.  However, next order will be without tha aloe vera -- this made the product slow to dry with a stickly sensation.</li>
            <li> Works well and lasts a long time. Really good investment.</li>
            <li> I recently had lumbar spine surgery, so even though the surgery was deemed a success, I still have referred pain from lingering muscle spasms...which I&#x27;ve been told can take up to a year to resolve.  So I bought this magnesium oil to help with the spasms.  I&#x27;m still taking medication, so I do not know if the oil is helping...but getting more magnesium into my system while I&#x27;m healing is a good thing. I rub it on my legs, thighs, buttocks and hips.  DO NOT PUT THIS ANYWHERE NEAR YOUR INCISION OR IT WILL BURN.  I also put some on the soles of my feet, but my feet became too dry...so no more feet.  It&#x27;s essentially a high magnesium salt water...that has a faint scent of low tide...but the smell eventually dissipates.  I&#x27;m not going to give up on this.  I feel using this will give me a long-term benefit on my road to recovery.  one more thing: It does tingle when you apply it...not a pleasant tingling sensation, but a borderline burning sensation.  The directions do state that this will happen if you are low in magnesium.  I&#x27;m at the point where I feel very little, if at all tingling.  So don&#x27;t let the tingle/burn stop you from using it.</li>
            <li> This has been interesting to use. I received this free in order to do a review and I have just rounded out my first 10 days of using this. I&#x27;ve been using it to soothe my sore muscles as I start trying to get back into a workout routine. It seems to help some, but it certainly not a miracle cure. I think it&#x27;s would be an excellent addition to your recovery regimen but I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it be the only piece of that routine. The oil doesn&#x27;t have any foul odors which was a pleasant surprise as I tend to be sensitive to that. I used it a couple of times right after I worked out in the evening and it did seem to help me fall asleep a bit quicker too.</li>
            <li> I am a first time user and have now become a lifetime user. It really helps my leg pain, and helps to relax me at night. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I think that that this does help with leg cramps. BUT it is so messy, smelly and itchy that it is hard to apply it in a time frame that allows it to soak in until dry, and then be washed off.</li>
            <li> My Parkinson&#x27;s patient feels it is helping some with his restless leg syndrome.</li>
            <li> Great product that has really helped decrease migraine frequency.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works, in only a week my back and shoulder pain had reduced dramatically. I&#x27;ve been telling everyone about it!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Interesting stuff that appears to work quite well. If you have restless leg syndrome you need this stuff. Works quickly. &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> takes longer to act than drinking tonic water.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my mom, since she is having leg cramps. It has really helped. I then decide to use it by myself and Viola I discover it works as a natural deodorant also.</li>
            <li> Just what the dr. Ordered. Great way to supplement magnesium deficiency. Helps muscles relax. Helpful for my slow digestion issues. I will  re-order as needed.</li>
            <li> Horrible!  It burns and itches so bad that I had to get out of bed and take a shower and change my bedding. Not what I needed when I was already tired from working all day and was in pain.  I&#x27;m going to try to get a refund.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product.  I bought it to help with my headaches and it has definitely helped decrease the frequency of my headaches.  It does sting a little but I think that is normal and just the magnesium working.  I am really glad that I purchased this product and definitely will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. I had been using a different brand of magnesium oil previously, but that product left my skin so itchy I just had to discontinue it. My reason for using magnesium oil is to prevent the excruciating foot and leg cramps that made my life miserable.While oral magnesium supplements were helpful, I could not get enough mgs. of magnesium from this source without the unpleasant side effects of diarrhea. A combination of the oral supplements and the magnesium oil applied to my skin seemed to be the answer for me, but the itching became unbearable. Magnesium oil with aloe Vera solved my problem. No itchiness at all. The only issue I had with the oil was that the label did not give me the mgs. of magnesium present in each spray. I contacted the manufacturer via email and received a response within 24 hours with the info I was looking for. Excellent customer service! I expect to be a regular customer.</li>
            <li> Both myself and my husband have used the magnesium with aloe spray and had positive results.  we neither one had a problem with itching and found relief from muscle stiffness and restless legs.</li>
            <li> I have not found any itchiness with this at all.  I am not sure how effective it is because I have just started using it but am pleased so far</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any benefits from using this. It also itches upon putting it on. Not bad - the itching subsides quickly and is worse if applied some areas (top of feet, stomach) than others (arms, legs, bottom of feet). I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good product, just not noticing anything from using it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product and it works quickly when my medication has not kicked in yet.  I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Does burn when you first start using it, however I love this product. The first month I was using it, it made it so that I didn&#x27;t have a migraine  with my PMS. I wasn&#x27;t sure this was what was helping. I stopped for and the next month the migraine was back. so the following month I used it 3 days before my cycle and I didn&#x27;t have a headache this month. Great for helping get to sleep too. (one con of using on the bottom of the feet is that makes the feet more dry)</li>
            <li> After taking the liquid, ionic magnesium I was impressed with the instant results (in some ways). It eliminated taking any of those fake fiber products like Benefiber, that are not good for your health anyway. Also eliminated use of laxatives (helpful for those on pain medications). However, the precise reason I purchased this spray-on magnesium was for horrible muscle spasms in my back for the last three months. The deep massage is too expensive to have done every few days. I have used it for about 10 days. There is no sting, but merely a tingle. The inconvenience is after spraying it on, you have to give it time to dry. It is not very oily, so you can put your pajamas on right over it. That being said, I have not noticed a lessening of pain in my back muscles. However, I have wanted something healthy in place of the usual deodorant which contains so many chemicals. It works well as a deodorant (although in very humid areas the drying time might be inconvenient.) My chiropractor said to spray it on all the lymph node areas and the body will absorb it readily that way. The smell should be noted; it has an unpleasant smell, like mold, so I will definitely not buy it again. Back to the crystal rock for deodorant because it&#x27;s much easier.</li>
            <li> It was packaged well and delivered on time. I have not had any itchiness and there is no fragrances (which I like bc I am very sensitive to additives).</li>
            <li> Great shipping. Just not sure if I noticed a difference yet. Will keep trying.</li>
            <li> I am 83 years old. I had been battling Insomnia, restless leg syndrome, leg cramping and arrhythmia for some time. I am also pre-diabetic, but refuse to begin  taking pills.  After three days of using Magnesium Oil, I was enjoying 8 uninterrupted hours of sleep!  The restless leg syndrome and leg cramps were but a memory. Arthritic knees, hip and joint pains were gone as well.  This. Stuff. Works.  My morning blood sugar reading has gone from 135 to 103 and sometimes 97! (Of course I am mindful of  carbohydrates, eat no simple carbs and the complex  ones in moderation.)  I feel calmer. My serotonin level must be up. I am not a negative being. but my mood is better. I feel happy and good.  The quality of  my life is much improved. I also no longer need that afternoon nap.  It is amazing that Magnesium Oil can address so much. My daughter is maintaining a normal blood pressure without  medication, using Magnesium Oil.  . Magnesium Oil is a Miracle. I highly recommend Magnesium Oil.</li>
            <li> It is less itchy than other magnesium oils I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> sticky, has a smell.  gets all over everything.  definitely isn&#x27;t &#x27;water&#x27; in that it doesn&#x27;t evaporate.  i put it on my feet, got up to use the restroom and now there are oily foot prints everywhere.  all over the bed.  just kind of a mess.  not sure if it works - symptoms are less severe but i&#x27;m attacking my RLS from 5 different angles .  has by no means been a miracle worker for me but will keep at it</li>
            <li> Works well on bad leg cramps when used as directed.</li>
            <li> Perfect.  Shipping was so fast! When I first started using this oil it would itch and sting so much I didn&#x27;t want to keep using it.  But the aloe version really,  really helps.  I thought mauve it wasn&#x27;t as effective,  but it is! Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t itch at all, but it still keeps my mineral deficiency at bay.  Kudos.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for my feet and right away I notice that it works. Takes the pain away and my feet can rest peacefully. Also does help for headaches.</li>
            <li> My son is fourteen and uses this for nighttime soreness/growing pains. Not sure whether it&#x27;s a placebo, but it does seem to help significantly with sleep. It also has helped heal some sores my husband gets on his legs from bumping into things (he delivers furniture and is a drummer, so he is forever carrying things that bang into his shins).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has not experienced itchiness or rashes, even though he has extremely sensitive skin. Definitely worth a try. However, if you have autoimmune disease, you may want to steer clear, as magnesium stimulates the immune system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I added a star, because I used this to stop a night time foot cramp in its tracks. I had been having a lupus flare, and I was getting foot and leg cramps in my sleep every night and they would go on for half an hour or more. I put this next to my bed the other night, and when the cramps started, I rubbed this right on the spot, and got immediate relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also got a fever and a rash. Because lupus. But I would use this again in a heartbeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I was provided a sample to test for this review.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my knee pain.  It seems to be helping.  I ill continue to use and update if things change.</li>
            <li> My wife has many allergies (including ALL corn products, i.e. corn starch, etc). Most pills use a corn starch binder. Any magnesium that goes through her digestive system causes many problems. Our physician sent us to a pharmacy that creates custom-made compounds like magnesium, but wanted $60 for a one month supply. After doing some research, we determined that this magnesium oil would work just fine for her magnesium deficiency. She has noticed very little itching ... she calls it a slight tingling ... when it is first applied. It has eliminated some muscle aches in the back of her neck, eliminated the restless leg problems and increased her magnesium levels. Her doctor is impressed.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have ordered this, I have leg cramps and I use this on my feet and legs every night Since I have been using this I have not had very many leg cramps at all. It has helped me so much. I will continue to buy this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how, but it&#x27;s actually oily... Non-drying, soothing. Skin clearing, energizing.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t sting, but haven&#x27;t noticed any difference yet</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it enough to see the effects yet,I&#x27;m using it for my art I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s going to work..i will give it 4 stars an hope it works for that score..</li>
            <li> I am so very impressed with this product and this company. As soon as I ordered, I received an email from Seven Minerals describing how to best use the magnesium oil.  I have noticed a dramatic difference in my energy levels lately and I love it! I definitely recommend, in fact, I just told me mom to buy it too.</li>
            <li> I had been waking up with leg cramps. Then I read in a couple of sources that taking a magnesium supplement along with spraying magnesium oil directly on the muscles would reduce and/or prevent leg cramps. Since I began following this advice, I have experienced fewer and less severe leg cramps during the night.</li>
            <li> This product really works!!! I have had legs cramps for years that have kept me from having a good night&#x27;s sleep almost every night.  I have tried numerous products, ice packs and massage.  Nothing helped me until I found Magnesium Oil.  It has helped relax my leg and feet muscles, and I have slept wonderfully well every night since I started using it.  It is amazing.  I don&#x27;t dread my nights anymore.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:7062bdb19c7bffe54d36f3c56659fef0]] In my video, I give you a close-up look at how it looks going on and how well it absorbs.  I really like this product because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  My husband and I didn&#x27;t experience any itching.&lt;br /&gt;2.  You get a nice large bottle and the sprayer works well.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Seems to work to relax tense muscles and relax me overall in preparation to sleep&lt;br /&gt;4.  Absorbs quickly without any oily residue.  It does leave my hands with a slightly tacky feel to it though so I rinse my hands off with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth trying if you have chronic tension/soreness/migraines!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample to review.</li>
            <li> Seven Miracles was kind enough to send me a sample bottle for evaluation.  I received a very large bottle  of Magnesium Oil. The bottle has a spray nozzle on top. If it is used as a body spray it will last for months. The oil is dispensed in a light mist and holding the bottle about 6 inches from your skin  will create about a 6&amp;#34; diameter circle of liquid. The directions say to spray and let dry, but it is an oil and doesn&#x27;t really dry. The oil leaves your skin tacky and I can feel a light adhesion when my skin rubs against clothes or bed sheets. I haven&#x27;t noticed any staining. I do notice some localized stinging  after application. The stinging doesn&#x27;t last long. I don&#x27;t like the sour smell of the oil. It smells like cactus pulp. I haven&#x27;t noticed any ill effects  of increased muscle or joint pain  resulting from the use of the spray.  And I can honestly say that when applying the oil to the bottom of my feet at night I have a more restful and usually uninterrupted sleep.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I&#x27;ve always preferred minerals sourced from the Great Salt Lake, but other products have been inconsistent.  This is well-tested, pure, and gives me consistently great results.  This magnesium helps me with muscle pain and fatigue, migraines, joint pain, anxiety, better sleep, pretty much everything.</li>
            <li> Super convenient to apply and I definitely feel an ease of the aches and pains of my joints and muscles. Don&#x27;t like that it leaves my skin a little sticky/tacky but it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product. I can get past the slight &amp;#34;stinging&amp;#34; people talk about but the aloe version is so greasy/filmy feeling I can&#x27;t stand to use it. I have used less, tried to rub in well, tried to remember to use it before a bath... Now it just takes up space on my counter.</li>
            <li> This product is not effective, it does not ease the pain.</li>
            <li> I mostly use magnesium flakes in a foot bath and occasionally use the spray when I don&#x27;t have time to soak.  The spray leaves a residue that I don&#x27;t like, but for the benefits of magnesium, it&#x27;s worth it. You can always wash it off after a while.  I like using the spray to tell me when my levels are sufficient.  When the are, it doesn&#x27;t sting to put on this product.  If it does sting, then my levels are becoming depleted.  Then I do the foot bath more often.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. Love it!</li>
            <li> This was very itchy...to the point that it&#x27;s hard to sleep.  I ended up going to the doctor about my jerky legs and he put me on meds for Restless Leg Syndrome and now I sleep like a baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a minor muscle problem maybe this will help.  My doctor said soaking in Epsom salts can also help without the itchiness.  But if your legs are jerking around a lot, go to the doctor, this is not going to help you.</li>
            <li> I have not used magnesium oil before, although I have definitely taken some long soaks in the tub with epsom salts, so I know the power of magnesium sulfate to soothe muscle aches. There were a couple of other benefits I was also interested in -- this is supposed to help you sleep, and magnesium is also effective against hypertension (though with this last one, if your blood pressure is dangerously high, you should be seeking the treatment of a physician!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was most interested in the sleep aid properties. I figured this was a product that wouldn&#x27;t be addictive or leave me groggy in the morning; I&#x27;ve always been hesitant to take sleeping pills. And I will say, after using this for 2-3 weeks, the length and quality of my sleep are improving. I have never had trouble falling asleep, but I have had a lot of trouble staying asleep (and sometimes I am quite restless during sleep -- I have an activity tracker that will attest to that). But after a week or so of using this (the manufacturer says you&#x27;ll see optimum benefits at two weeks or later), I found that I was staying asleep for longer and moving around less at night. As a result, I&#x27;m feeling much more rested in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know that this is having a huge effect on my blood pressure, but my blood pressure wasn&#x27;t too bad to begin with, and I&#x27;m also altering my diet and exercise. It certainly isn&#x27;t hurting, though. I haven&#x27;t had any muscle pain to use this on yet, but when I do, I&#x27;ll update the review. Lately, the main thing I&#x27;ve been wanting for this product is improved sleep, and I&#x27;m getting that so I&#x27;m happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word on the &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; of this: when I spray it on the bottom of my feet, I just feel a little wetness (you can rub it in if you want). The skin on the bottom of my feet is pretty thick and does not get irritated with the use of this product. If I spray this on softer/thinner skin (say, my calves or the tops of my feet), I do think it&#x27;s a little uncomfortable for a few minutes, although that fades fast and I wouldn&#x27;t say it itches. But since using it on the bottom of my feet has been working for me, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll keep doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final thing I&#x27;ll mention: I really don&#x27;t like the sprayer very much. It dribbles out rather large droplets of product rather than providing a nice spray pattern. It&#x27;s not the type of sprayer that&#x27;s adjustable. Because of this, it&#x27;s a bit difficult to get good coverage on the bottom of my feet, since I can&#x27;t turn my feet completely upside down to where they&#x27;re horizontal. (A better spray pattern could be used on a vertical surface.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, though, I&#x27;m happy because I&#x27;m sleeping better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the manufacturer for evaluation purposes.a few minutes, although that fades fast and I wouldn&#x27;t say it itches.

            <li> Positive results and great customer service. Will definitely purchase this again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using topical magnesium for several years.  This is my second brand and it satisifies my intake and absorption needs.  I recommend this to clients as well (exercise professional), but be wary of the extra tingling on the skin.  Althoug it seems normal.</li>
            <li> Works great. Helps with sore muscles and seems to improve my sleep too.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this product prepping and recovering for triathlons , my legs feels much better because of it !</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Its useless !!!</li>
            <li> The oil doesn&#x27;t burn like regular magnesium oil due to the Aloe Vera. This is perfect for me as I love to exercise and I&#x27;m finding that I&#x27;m moving much better. I bought some for my brother-in-law and this magnesium oil has helped his shoulder move much better. Thanks for a great product</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband who has multiple chronic issues- the worst being RSD/CRPS . After a life time of malnutrition this has not been a miracle cure but it does seem to have helped it so far from getting worse. We also both started using it like an astrigent on our faces after having lifelong complexion/acne problem and I really love for that use. I stopped using any other astringent and lotion and it has really revitalized my skin- it is eavening out the skin tone, tightening pores, and after rinsing off the salty leftover- my skin is sooo soft.  I believe my skin now has a very healthy glow- my husband also....it did indeed sting like heck at first but now it is not too bad.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  I wasn&#x27;t sure about it, but it has helped with some post-surgery ankle and back pain that I have been having.  It also works great for headaches.  My surgery was is in the stomach area and has healed.  I put the oil on my stomach daily, and it reduces a typical post-surgery side effect from my hysterectomy: swelly belly as the day goes on.  I highly recommend it.  It was packaged well, and my family is now using it post-workout.  I have experienced inconsistent itching, but it is minimal and goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> I have only had this a few days and have not seen the &amp;#34;instant calmness&amp;#34; that others have written about.  I do have RLS and take medication for it.  I will continue to use this to see if it gets better with time.</li>
            <li> One of the latest health crazes is Pure Magnesium Oil. There are hundreds of benefits being credited to this supplement, and this is why it&#x27;s getting a reputation for being called a miracle oil. Most of us are deficient in magnesium which has been linked with numerous health issues:&lt;br /&gt;Depression&lt;br /&gt;Fatigue&lt;br /&gt;Sleep problems&lt;br /&gt;Migraine&lt;br /&gt;Cluster headaches&lt;br /&gt;Osteoporosis&lt;br /&gt;Premenstrual syndrome&lt;br /&gt;Chest pain (angina)&lt;br /&gt;Hypertension&lt;br /&gt;Type II diabetes&lt;br /&gt;Asthma&lt;br /&gt;To be effective, Magnesium oil must be as pure as possible. I have been using Magnesium oil for over a month now, and I am loving it. I have noticed that my migraine headaches have been reduced in frequency and impact. I live in Alberta and our autumns, winters, and springs bring Chinook winds and changes in barometric pressure, thus causing migraines among many residents. I also noticed a marked increase in my energy levels and mood. I&#x27;m also experiencing an all-around feeling of well-being.&lt;br /&gt;The word oil may be deceving, however, because it is very drying.  I had to vary the location of my body where I sprayed the oil as it leaves the skin extremely dry. The best place to spray is on the soles of the feet. I have also sprayed on my knee, in the underarm area, on my chest, and tummy. Once the oil dries, I apply lotion to keep the skin moist. An alternative is Magnesium oil with Aloe Vera. It is less drying, but also a little less strong and effective than the pure stuff.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll find magnesium oil in use at many spas around the world, and it is now readily available for the consumer. I have been using a brand by Seven Minerals because it is tested and purified and in a natural state, and I&#x27;m definitely hooked. Used hand-in-hand with a good moisturizer, this is a wonderful supplment to add to your daily health regime. Very highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to try for night leg cramps. After about one week no more cramps. I use nightly after my bath. Sleep wonderful. Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great product. There are many reason to use magnesium. This product makes it easy, no skin irritation and will last a long time. Love it on my achey feet and an occasional sore spot on my back.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and great seller!</li>
            <li> Ancient minerals was purchased by my daughter.  It worked!  I decided to purchase my own &amp; went with Seven Minerals with aloe Vera.  I am disappointed as I feel no benefits with this product like I did the other.  I assumed it would be the same as Ancient Minerals but the aloe would reduce the itching. I will research mag oil again &amp; make another choice.  The Seven Minerals w/o aloe may be a better product.</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT COMPLIMENTARY FOR THE PURPOSE OF MY OBJECTIVE REVIEW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I DON&#x27;T like about this product: The smell is quite salty, because it obviously has salt as an ingredient. I just wished they found a way to either negate it or add a fragrance so it doesn&#x27;t smell so bad. Also, the first time I used it, I itched up a storm! The instructions say that is normal, especially if your body has a magnesium deficiency, and that after several applications it will get better. Sure enough, the second time was a lot more tolerable, and although it still itches a little sometimes, it&#x27;s fine, because...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do like: It works! It just plain works. I tried it on a lingering bad ankle sprain, and so far it has helped tremendously with the pain. I will keep applying on other areas, like my back and joints, and update this review after a while. It&#x27;s also supposed to work on headaches! Also, it is a very soluble liquid, and washes off easily and instantly without leaving any traces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With anything that&#x27;s medicinal, the bottom line is if it works or not. And since it has helped me greatly, I can overcome the smell and itchiness. I always rate the item with the price in mind, because nowadays that is a key factor in deciding what you buy and whether you buy that one, or something else. However, I truly don&#x27;t know how much this is worth. I guess if I were to buy it, I would spend up to $30 for this. You do get a big 12 oz. bottle, which should last you months, if not years. I really recommend you give this a try and see for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I have worked very hard to achieve the ranking I have now. I am very grateful to all the people who have trusted my reviews over the years and have voted positively on my reviews. Therefore, I will ALWAYS state at the very top if I received the item complimentary from the vendor, and what I DON&#x27;T like about the product(if any) before I write about the things I do like. Thank you, everyone, and have an awesome 2015!**</li>
            <li> Great product, I&#x27;m very happy with this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using product on and off for 2 weeks after a shower.  When product was delivered, it had a piece of tape on top of bottle, appearing to hold the cap on.  There was no leakage; however, I have found it very hard to squeeze the product out (I am able to spray small amounts out though, so I&#x27;m okay with this).  Other than that small issue of the top, I love the product, and plan on using it more often as it does feel good on the skin.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle and I am not 100% sure if it is helping or not ,but i thought i would give it another chance.</li>
            <li> Great product will definitely purchase again.  Have definitely noticed difference in pain levels using this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product! have had back surgery 6 months ago. Can&#x27;t live without! That&#x27;s why I ordered my second bottle before I emptied my first bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! How can something so simple work so well?!?!? I suffer from frequent tension headaches and they can last up to 10 days and NOTHING I take helps, I just have to deal with it until it&#x27;s gone. I also have an issue sleeping at night, I can fall asleep fine, but, staying asleep is a problem and sleeping medication, even Melatonin, gives me terrible dreams so I stay away from those. One may have something to do with the other - who knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this for the first time over the weekend, I was in the middle of a tension headache spell, so I decided to give this a try. I was VERY impressed. I slept through the night for the first time in forever, AND, my headache went away!! Whoooo Hoooo! I am so well rested I don&#x27;t know how to act!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is so simple to use, I just rub it on the bottom of my feet after my shower and I rubbed it on the pained areas too. There isn&#x27;t a scent and the Aloe leaves the skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used magnesium in a spray before I received this complimentary sample of Seven Minerals Magnesium oil (for review purposes). Lack of magnesium can cause muscle cramps and heart palpitations, menstrual cramps, restless legs and constipation (Milk of Magnesia is an anti-constipation medicine). It&#x27;s most common in people who do a lot of sports or sweat a lot from working outdoors, but as much as 80% of people are low in magnesium. Magnesium is found naturally in green leafy vegetables, cashew nuts and pumpkin seeds, and some legumes like black beans, but many people don&#x27;t eat enough of these foods to get sufficient magnesium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Magnesium &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34;, which is not really an oil (it&#x27;s magnesium chloride), is found in brine harvested from ancient sea beds, and can be absorbed through the skin. It&#x27;s more easily absorbed by our bodies this way than through taking an oral supplement. I&#x27;ve used Seven Minerals Magnesium oil for about a week now, and as with many vitamin and mineral supplements it&#x27;s hard to say it&#x27;s definitely working. I spray it on my feet and let it dry before I go to bed. I don&#x27;t notice the itching some reviews have noted, but I have noticed that my restless/twitchy legs have been better since I started using it. The aloe vera added to this product soothes the skin and helps counteract the salt, although I also use a moisturizer on my feet after the spray has dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe this is a convenient and effective way to add magnesium to your body, and people with more severe cramping issues could find some relief from it. Because my diet is pretty balanced already, I didn&#x27;t see huge benefits but I do feel it helped with my restless legs at night.</li>
            <li> Note: a free sample was provided for review purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supplements are almost always a tricky thing to evaluate, whether you&#x27;re writing or reading a review.  Was it the supplement that made the difference, or something else that I also changed at the same time that I started taking/using it?  It&#x27;s like folks that claim a diet pill really works for them, even though they started eating healthier and exercising at the same time they started taking it.  This oil is no different.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s actually made a difference for me, nor would I be able to say that it would help you even if I did think it helped me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I decided to evaluate this oil mainly because of the following - the company offers a 360 day money back guarantee.  That&#x27;s tough to beat!  That lets you try it out yourself and decide if it works for _you_.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my personal experience with this, I can say the following:&lt;br /&gt;(*) Product is very easy to apply, as you simply spray the liquid on to yourself.  It&#x27;s called an \\&quot;oil,\\&quot; but it&#x27;s very much like spraying or misting water on yourself from a spray bottle.  It&#x27;s a little oily, but not bad at all&lt;br /&gt;(*) I felt a little itchiness when applied to my torso, but none at all when applied to my arms and feet.  The itchiness was mild, and I may have only really noticed it because the product notes mention it might happen&lt;br /&gt;(*) There was a very noticeable layer of salt residue left behind on my skin.  I wouldn&#x27;t say that I would have been scared to walk by a herd of cows (\\&quot;look, a salt lick!\\&quot;)...well, any more scared than I&#x27;d normally be :D, but I was surprised the first time at just how much salt there was.  It was a pretty solid layer in areas&lt;br /&gt;(*) I haven&#x27;t yet noticed any changes in regards to aches/pains/anything, but I&#x27;ve only used it a few times&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the layer of salt left behind, I suggest using this before you bathe.  Spray it on, give it a few minutes to absorb, then shower/bathe as usual to get the residue off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it five stars for ease of application and having no financial risk because of the guarantee, but I give it four stars overall because of the amount of salt residue left behind.  If the product intrigues you, I&#x27;d say go for it because of the guarantee.s usual to get the residue off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it five stars for ease of application and having no financial risk because of the guarantee, but I give it four stars overall because of the amount of salt residue left behind.

            <li> I previously bought magnesium salts and have been making my own magnesium &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s health benefits are impressive (improved sleep, mood, heart health, a long list), and magnesium oil is hands down the best way to get magnesium into the system.  What I like most about it is that it helps me to sleep.  HOWEVER, in mixing my own I&#x27;ve tried different proportions of water to salts, different bottles, and the dispenser always clogs, SUCH a pain.  This one doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had an issue with itching, but I typically have a burning sensation, worse on some parts of my body than others.  I have sensitive skin that reacts to everything, even tap water in some locales.  Everyone&#x27;s different, I&#x27;m sure, but I can spray this formulation liberally everywhere but on my inner forearms with no stinging, even on my neck- awesome!  And I tried it for a good long while before reviewing to make sure the spray mechanism didn&#x27;t clog.  Worth every penny not to have to bother to make one&#x27;s own, and MUCH improved with the addition of aloe vera.  No perfumes or additives, just pure magnesium chloride and organic whole leaf aloe vera juice.  Highest recommendation!</li>
            <li> This product stings when put on and leaves an ugly white residue.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. After I shower, I spray the magnesium on and let it dry before I apply my natural deodorant.</li>
