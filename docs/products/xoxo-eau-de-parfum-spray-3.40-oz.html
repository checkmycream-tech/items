            <li> It smells like a very old perfume, I assume I received an old and expired perfume (I hope I am wrong, but I don&#x27;t think so).</li>
            <li> Though this is what I ordered, it took a little longer than I was expecting, to get here, and I swear, it smells a little different than my last bottle of XOXO.</li>
            <li> I really regret this purchase :(</li>
