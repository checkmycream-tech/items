            <li>The size is good and the texture strong.  </li>
            <li>My skin does not feel as clean or refreshed as it does with the Kirkland products, nor do I see any great beauty results:)</li>
            <li>It does a great job of removing makeup and leaving skin feel fresh and cleansed.</li>
            <li>my skin is sensitive and these work perfect for me.  </li>

            <li>and they help keep his face clean and get a good seal with his mask.  </li>
            <li>so this is very important to</li>
            <li>Keeps my combination skin moisturized after wiping, and I feel good going to bed after quick use of two wipes a night.&lt;br /&gt;Makes</li>
            <li>I love Amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save.  </li>
            <li>Love these, use every day, with the moisturizers, at 64</li>
            <li>Olay cloths are just okay.</li>
            <li>not so bad!!!!It was ok.</li>
            <li>excellent, cleans and moisturizes at the same time!</li>
            <li>youthful so many people tells me how beautify my skin look..</li>
            <li>I some times have to use more than one cloth to get all my makeup off.</li>
            <li>Like it - dont love it.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of my skin after using these.</li>
            <li>Plus I do believe they make my skin look more youthful.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it because it is so moisturizing as well as cleansing.</li>
            <li>okay, I don&#x27;t love them.  </li>
            <li>So, they&#x27;re just okay.</li>
            <li>I am in love with these wipes.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE these things.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing people with dryer skin will love this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love these cloths.  </li>
            <li>My face is still combination but more</li>
            <li>love it and it does not break me out</li>
            <li>Does a nice of job of cleaning off  makeup and light moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure</li>
            <li>They are perfect for my combination skin, not too oily or too dry.</li>
            <li>They are scented, but I don&#x27;t find the scent overwhelming or bothersome, and I&#x27;m a person who can&#x27;t tolerate strong perfumes.  </li>
            <li>This is a decent price for a good product, so I will probably order more.</li>
            <li>The cloth is overall very good.  </li>
            <li>Overall, great purchase, great value, &amp; I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>; however, these keep my skin looking and feeling clean and healthy, which is what I want.</li>
            <li>so I felt the smell was abit strong</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame because I normally have good luck with Olay products.</li>
            <li>Fine for oily skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although, after I gave my face a quick rinse with water, my oily skin breathed better.</li>
            <li>Go here quick!  </li>
            <li>They leave my skin feeling silky smooth and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>These are great at removing my face makeup and my eye makeup...and one is enough to accomplish both.  </li>
            <li>These work great, especially at taking off stubborn mascara.</li>
            <li>They leave my face smooth and don&#x27;t cause any breakouts.</li>
            <li>and they are great makeup removers when you don&#x27;t feel like actually washing your face.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling very clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>My face feels smooth and clean after using the wipe.</li>
            <li>I love most of the Olay products, but find these cloth wipes very helpful when you need to wash your face quickly.  </li>
            <li>for being a quick way to wash your face when you dont have a bathroom sink available.</li>
            <li>My face feels so clean after I use them and looks brighter, too.</li>
            <li>Ever since I &amp;#34;discovered&amp;#34; this product, I have used nothing else to clean my face at night.</li>
            <li>It is waterproof mascara, to be fair, but I&#x27;ve had other cloths work better.  </li>
            <li>They are a real bargain for the price and work better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, has aging treatments in it, and seals nicely.  </li>
            <li>Love these - super convenient and gently removes makeup</li>
            <li>this is a great one,cleans face while moisturizing,,also use olay moisturizers,among other products from olay</li>
            <li>I purchased the equivalent product at Costco (Kirkland brand) at significantly lower price but was in Maine and far from one of thise stores so decided to try these from Olay since I do like many of their products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Normally I would forgo washing my face at night when I was exhausted, but now I just grab one of these handy towelettes and quickly do something good for my skin!</li>
            <li>Many people have asked me for the secret to my great complexion</li>
            <li>Love oil of olay products but the last time I went to order it they weren&#x27;t available.  </li>
            <li>I ruined two nice quality white pillow cases before I figured out</li>
            <li>She has mentioned several times how nice her skin is compared to some of her classmates.</li>
            <li>so that the top ones stay moist - it keeps them from getting too wet on the bottom/dry on the top.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Blimishes are rare when using these wipes consistently&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel fresh and moist after using these.</li>
            <li>My waterproof mascara comes right off without having to use a lot of pressure to get it off.</li>
            <li>It also stings my eyes just a tiny bit, perhaps because I have to work it in so much for it to be effective.  </li>
            <li>These cloths are smooth and don&#x27;t really feel like they&#x27;re cleaning my face as much as pushing dirt around.  </li>
            <li>It cleans thoroughly taking off makeup easily and leaving a soft feel to the face.</li>
            <li>A little soapier than I like, but they were a good deal</li>
            <li>This was my first attempt to use cleansing sheets</li>
            <li>The label on the top peels back to uncover an opening that lets you remove the cloths and then reseals well to prevent the cloths from drying out.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find the Total Effects in any store so</li>
            <li>Not my first choice for that purpose...</li>
            <li>Still  its better than scrubbing my makeup off with facewash (I use Olay Total Effects Blemish Control</li>
            <li>I love these wipes as I use Olay products for my facial upkeep.  </li>
            <li>First of all, they clean her skin and keep it soft.</li>
            <li>These are so easy and quick to use--no reason after a long day to not take the 20 seconds and wash our face.  </li>
            <li>It does remove eye make up easily, but my foundation only comes off about 80%.</li>
            <li>Good for traveling and limited room to bring bottles and tubes of facial cleansing and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve managed it very well.  </li>
            <li>I need the wipes as a time saver when I&#x27;m getting ready for bed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for over a year now and will continue they really helps my skin to look</li>
            <li>Now my 14-year-old daughter is also using it nightly and absolutely loves it as well.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a reflection on the product they worked really, really well</li>
            <li>I really like these wipes.  </li>
            <li>After using the CVS brand of this product, I decided to buy the real brand.</li>
            <li>...as a cloth to refresh your face while applying a light layer of facial cream.  </li>
            <li>I really like them because they seem to get all my makeup off and doesn&#x27;t give me acne.  </li>
            <li>it takes all my make up off and leaves it ready for my night treatment.</li>
            <li>/&gt;they are much better then the other brands that I have tried..</li>
            <li>tired!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive tried many other wipes, and none compare to these.</li>
            <li>otherwise, I think I&#x27;ll stick to my regular Olay clean effects for make up removal.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find it dries out at all, but I use one at least 5 nights/week so might go through them more quickly them some.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for older complexions.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I dont use it to remove eye makeup, but as far as getting my skin clean before bed, thse things are all that I have used for several years.</li>
            <li>Clean,  not too greasy or too dry.</li>
            <li>I would say we both have normal skin</li>
            <li>but it definitely makes the face fresh.</li>
            <li>One side is textured for cleaning and the other smooth.  </li>
            <li>this along with the oil free daily Total Effects cream.</li>
            <li>my bedtime routine so much easier, especially when Im really</li>
            <li>They clean very well and even have a slight exfoliating and tingling effect.  </li>
            <li>Our skin is clear now!  </li>
            <li>Sometimes, if I have used a lot of make-up, I use another make-up removing cloth first and then follow with the Olay Total Effects.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe my face actually feels clean and moisturized without using traditional cleansers and water followed by a moisturizer!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over ten years to keep my face clean morning and night and have found it definitely keeps my complexion clear and youthful.  </li>
            <li>I rarely get blemishes anymore since using these, and my face is never taught or dry.</li>
            <li>my face has just a few fine wrinkles by the eyes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;Using</li>
            <li>My skin is adult acne prone</li>
            <li>Took off all makeup and my skin felt soft after.  </li>
            <li>Defying Cleansing Cloths leave the skin soft.  </li>
            <li>-- I have somewhat sensitive skin</li>
            <li>When I do wear makeup, I use MAC Wipes Cleansing Towelettes [http://www.amazon.com/Bulk-Wipes-Cleansing-Towelettes-Sheets/dp/B004J90ZMQ/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_sbs_bt_1] but they sting my sensitive skin and I have to wash my face afterwards.</li>
            <li>not sure they remove makeup as easily.  </li>
            <li>but WELL worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes out of stock due to its popularity</li>
            <li>I have tried at least 10 different kinds of facewipes (Ponds, Neutrogena, Garnier, Loreal, Roc, etc) and these are my favorite by far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone back to the other Olay Daily Facial cloths, which are MUCH more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This gets my makeup off quickly and with little fuss.</li>
            <li>I rarely have acne and I have used just about every other brand of face cloth out there and only ths one makes me break out.</li>
            <li>As soon as I went back to my old wipes it didn&#x27;t happen again.  </li>
            <li>The cloth is soft, and softer than the olay regular make up remover cloths.</li>
            <li>Scrubbing with this cloth doesn&#x27;t make my sensitive, acne prone skin red.</li>
            <li>I love facewipes because sometimes I just need something to keep by my bed at night when I am too tired to wash my face.</li>
            <li>However, sometimes I&#x27;m not sure the residue from the day&#x27;s activities is completely gone, and I feel the need to rinse with hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terry</li>
            <li>i did notice they do not dry my skin at all,</li>
            <li>The cloths are soft and thick and large enough to need only one per cleansing.  </li>
            <li>Will not leave your face feeling tight and dry, highly recommend!!</li>

            <li> They are scented, but I don&#x27;t find the scent overwhelming or bothersome, and I&#x27;m a person who can&#x27;t tolerate strong perfumes.  </li>
            <li> This is a decent price for a good product, so I will probably order more.</li>
            <li> The cloth is overall very good.  </li>
            <li> Overall, great purchase, great value, &amp; I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> ; however, these keep my skin looking and feeling clean and healthy, which is what I want.</li>
            <li> so I felt the smell was abit strong</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame because I normally have good luck with Olay products.</li>
            <li> Fine for oily skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although, after I gave my face a quick rinse with water, my oily skin breathed better.</li>
            <li> Go here quick!  </li>
            <li> They leave my skin feeling silky smooth and not greasy.  </li>
            <li> These are great at removing my face makeup and my eye makeup...and one is enough to accomplish both.  </li>
            <li> These work great, especially at taking off stubborn mascara.</li>
            <li> They leave my face smooth and don&#x27;t cause any breakouts.</li>
            <li> and they are great makeup removers when you don&#x27;t feel like actually washing your face.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling very clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> My face feels smooth and clean after using the wipe.</li>
            <li> I love most of the Olay products, but find these cloth wipes very helpful when you need to wash your face quickly.  </li>
            <li> for being a quick way to wash your face when you dont have a bathroom sink available.</li>
            <li> My face feels so clean after I use them and looks brighter, too.</li>
            <li> Ever since I &amp;#34;discovered&amp;#34; this product, I have used nothing else to clean my face at night.</li>
            <li> It is waterproof mascara, to be fair, but I&#x27;ve had other cloths work better.  </li>
            <li> They are a real bargain for the price and work better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, has aging treatments in it, and seals nicely.  </li>
            <li> Love these - super convenient and gently removes makeup</li>
            <li> this is a great one,cleans face while moisturizing,,also use olay moisturizers,among other products from olay</li>
            <li> I purchased the equivalent product at Costco (Kirkland brand) at significantly lower price but was in Maine and far from one of thise stores so decided to try these from Olay since I do like many of their products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Normally I would forgo washing my face at night when I was exhausted, but now I just grab one of these handy towelettes and quickly do something good for my skin!</li>
            <li> Many people have asked me for the secret to my great complexion</li>
            <li> Love oil of olay products but the last time I went to order it they weren&#x27;t available.  </li>
            <li> I ruined two nice quality white pillow cases before I figured out</li>
            <li> She has mentioned several times how nice her skin is compared to some of her classmates.</li>
            <li> so that the top ones stay moist - it keeps them from getting too wet on the bottom/dry on the top.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Blimishes are rare when using these wipes consistently&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel fresh and moist after using these.</li>
            <li> My waterproof mascara comes right off without having to use a lot of pressure to get it off.</li>
            <li> It also stings my eyes just a tiny bit, perhaps because I have to work it in so much for it to be effective.  </li>
            <li> These cloths are smooth and don&#x27;t really feel like they&#x27;re cleaning my face as much as pushing dirt around.  </li>
            <li> It cleans thoroughly taking off makeup easily and leaving a soft feel to the face.</li>
            <li> A little soapier than I like, but they were a good deal</li>
            <li> This was my first attempt to use cleansing sheets</li>
            <li> The label on the top peels back to uncover an opening that lets you remove the cloths and then reseals well to prevent the cloths from drying out.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to find the Total Effects in any store so</li>
            <li> Not my first choice for that purpose...</li>
            <li> Still  its better than scrubbing my makeup off with facewash (I use Olay Total Effects Blemish Control</li>
            <li> I love these wipes as I use Olay products for my facial upkeep.  </li>
            <li> First of all, they clean her skin and keep it soft.</li>
            <li> These are so easy and quick to use--no reason after a long day to not take the 20 seconds and wash our face.  </li>
            <li> It does remove eye make up easily, but my foundation only comes off about 80%.</li>
            <li> Good for traveling and limited room to bring bottles and tubes of facial cleansing and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve managed it very well.  </li>
            <li> I need the wipes as a time saver when I&#x27;m getting ready for bed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for over a year now and will continue they really helps my skin to look</li>
            <li> Now my 14-year-old daughter is also using it nightly and absolutely loves it as well.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a reflection on the product they worked really, really well</li>
            <li> I really like these wipes.  </li>
            <li> After using the CVS brand of this product, I decided to buy the real brand.</li>
            <li> ...as a cloth to refresh your face while applying a light layer of facial cream.  </li>
            <li> I really like them because they seem to get all my makeup off and doesn&#x27;t give me acne.  </li>
            <li> it takes all my make up off and leaves it ready for my night treatment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;they are much better then the other brands that I have tried..</li>
            <li> tired!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive tried many other wipes, and none compare to these.</li>
            <li> otherwise, I think I&#x27;ll stick to my regular Olay clean effects for make up removal.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it dries out at all, but I use one at least 5 nights/week so might go through them more quickly them some.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for older complexions.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I dont use it to remove eye makeup, but as far as getting my skin clean before bed, thse things are all that I have used for several years.</li>
            <li> Clean,  not too greasy or too dry.</li>
            <li> I would say we both have normal skin</li>
            <li> but it definitely makes the face fresh.</li>
            <li> One side is textured for cleaning and the other smooth.  </li>
            <li> this along with the oil free daily Total Effects cream.</li>
            <li> my bedtime routine so much easier, especially when Im really</li>
            <li> They clean very well and even have a slight exfoliating and tingling effect.  </li>
            <li> Our skin is clear now!  </li>
            <li> Sometimes, if I have used a lot of make-up, I use another make-up removing cloth first and then follow with the Olay Total Effects.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe my face actually feels clean and moisturized without using traditional cleansers and water followed by a moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over ten years to keep my face clean morning and night and have found it definitely keeps my complexion clear and youthful.  </li>
            <li> I rarely get blemishes anymore since using these, and my face is never taught or dry.</li>
            <li> my face has just a few fine wrinkles by the eyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;Using</li>
            <li> My skin is adult acne prone</li>
            <li> Took off all makeup and my skin felt soft after.  </li>
            <li> Defying Cleansing Cloths leave the skin soft.  </li>
            <li> -- I have somewhat sensitive skin</li>
            <li> When I do wear makeup, I use MAC Wipes Cleansing Towelettes [http://www.amazon.com/Bulk-Wipes-Cleansing-Towelettes-Sheets/dp/B004J90ZMQ/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_sbs_bt_1] but they sting my sensitive skin and I have to wash my face afterwards.</li>
            <li> not sure they remove makeup as easily.  </li>
            <li> but WELL worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes out of stock due to its popularity</li>
            <li> I have tried at least 10 different kinds of facewipes (Ponds, Neutrogena, Garnier, Loreal, Roc, etc) and these are my favorite by far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone back to the other Olay Daily Facial cloths, which are MUCH more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This gets my makeup off quickly and with little fuss.</li>
            <li> I rarely have acne and I have used just about every other brand of face cloth out there and only ths one makes me break out.</li>
            <li> As soon as I went back to my old wipes it didn&#x27;t happen again.  </li>
            <li> The cloth is soft, and softer than the olay regular make up remover cloths.</li>
            <li> Scrubbing with this cloth doesn&#x27;t make my sensitive, acne prone skin red.</li>
            <li> I love facewipes because sometimes I just need something to keep by my bed at night when I am too tired to wash my face.</li>
            <li> However, sometimes I&#x27;m not sure the residue from the day&#x27;s activities is completely gone, and I feel the need to rinse with hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terry</li>
            <li> i did notice they do not dry my skin at all,</li>
            <li> The cloths are soft and thick and large enough to need only one per cleansing.  </li>
            <li> Will not leave your face feeling tight and dry, highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no strong smell, and it feels gentle (like if you did have acne or something it wouldn&#x27;t burn.)</li>
            <li> I seriously doubt that these make me look any younger, but they clean my face and remove my makeup easily as expected.  </li>
            <li> The cloth is rough on my face and is not very wet.</li>
            <li> The only issue I&#x27;m having is that they seem to dry out my skin around my mouth and nose.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these Olay wet cleansing pad for a few years and really do like them.</li>
            <li> I do not like the other facial cloths from Olay (Regenerist) because they tend to dry my skin, but the Total Effects is definitely hydrating and whatever they put in them, they have helped me to combat wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> They are not perfect at getting all eye makeup off, but they&#x27;ll do the trick right before bed (and any eye makeup left over washes off the next morning in the shower).  </li>
            <li> I second everything the other people said.</li>
            <li> I will go back to the CVS brand...soft cloth and very wet?</li>
            <li> They are smallish and feel dry.</li>
            <li> It does not feel dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> the dry.</li>
            <li> They stay moist in the package, remove even waterproof make-up well, and leave my face felling moisturized, rather than dry.</li>
            <li> if this a also a problem with the Olay Wipes, but they don&#x27;t dry out when I do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for several years and they never let me down.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Based on my experience with the MAC wipes, I&#x27;ve gotten into the habit of turning any wipes that come in similar packaging upside down to keep them from drying out.</li>
            <li> The cloth is a little larger than some</li>
            <li> but I felt I owed it to other people who are looking at these Olay cleansing cloths.  </li>
            <li> and though I&#x27;m not old I do have a few wrinkles around my eyes and</li>
            <li> Even though other reviewers said so, it doesn&#x27;t remove make up fully.</li>
            <li> They are a little dry though.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think these are too harsh for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> When I am too tired to do a complete cleansing with my Olay Products, I will use the Olay Wet Cleansing Cloths.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I purchased a three pack of these based on the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> My mom is 87, and has trouble getting around with her walker after three back surgeries in the past 15 years.</li>
            <li> so well - store upside down</li>
            <li> I feel like I need to wipe down face after I use these.</li>
            <li> And CVS brand is half the price</li>
            <li> Use these things every single night to wipe off thick, cream foundation.</li>
            <li> I started using these a few weeks ago and noticed within a day or two that I started breaking out.</li>
            <li> I think after using for a few weeks,  </li>
            <li> It does require quite a few passes to remove my mascara.  </li>
            <li> no strong astringent or harsh cleanser on these wipes</li>
            <li> my complexion can look a little lifeless at times, I&#x27;ve found the cure!</li>
            <li> After I use it on my face I rub them on the backs of my hands, which were beginning to show a little age (I&#x27;m 60) and it noticeably helps!  </li>
            <li> Lately I have had trouble finding them in stock at the stores</li>
            <li> I have been using this product every night for the past four years.</li>
            <li> Though I usually buy unscented products becaus of allergies, these cloths have a pleeasant scent the doesn&#x27;t affect me adversely.</li>
            <li> However, they are not very good at removing makeup.</li>
            <li> Bending over a sink to cleanse with soap and water is just too hard for her to do.</li>
            <li> The wipes have a subtle scent, so it&#x27;s not overpowering when you&#x27;re cleaning your face.</li>
            <li> One caveat is that my sensitive skin HATED them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;PROs:&lt;br /&gt;It cleans my face well without drying me out or irritating my face.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, without the wipes, I&#x27;m bad about washing my face on a nightly basis &amp; if I&#x27;m not using my night cream, it&#x27;s not going to work.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with the Olay product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I keep one package in the bathroom for nighttime facial cleansing, and one in the refrigerator for those mornings when my eyes and face are puffy. It does a great job of removing makeup and leaving skin feel fresh and cleansed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over ten years to keep my face clean morning and night and have found it definitely keeps my complexion clear and youthful.  Many people have asked me for the secret to my great complexion and I always tell them about Olay Total Effects Cleansing Cloths.  Lately I have had trouble finding them in stock at the stores so I began ordering them through Amazon.  I hope Olay is not discontinuing this product!!!!  I do not like the other facial cloths from Olay (Regenerist) because they tend to dry my skin, but the Total Effects is definitely hydrating and whatever they put in them, they have helped me to combat wrinkles.  Sometimes, if I have used a lot of make-up, I use another make-up removing cloth first and then follow with the Olay Total Effects.  It is like a spa for my skin.</li>
            <li> Love oil of olay products but the last time I went to order it they weren&#x27;t available.  Now the price went up.  Ponds works just as well and is cheaper.</li>
            <li> for being a quick way to wash your face when you dont have a bathroom sink available. Also, these work AWESOME after  using my epilator! redness &amp; pain gone within an hour using these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for several years and they never let me down.  My waterproof mascara comes right off without having to use a lot of pressure to get it off. They are a real bargain for the price and work better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried .</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling very clean and fresh.  Fine for oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;Using this along with the oil free daily Total Effects cream.</li>
            <li> A little soapier than I like, but they were a good deal</li>
            <li> best thing ever......</li>
            <li> My husband and I use these every night and every time we need to freshen up.  I would say we both have normal skin but I don&#x27;t think these are too harsh for dry skin.  We are around 40, but occasionally had breakouts.  Our skin is clear now!  These are so easy and quick to use--no reason after a long day to not take the 20 seconds and wash our face.  They are not drying to skin, but we of course still moisturize.  We will continue to use.  I love Amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save.  We have these sent every 6 weeks and I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out!</li>
            <li> Love these, use every day, with the moisturizers, at 64 my face has just a few fine wrinkles by the eyes. Have used Olay for years, it is the best.</li>
            <li> I purchased the equivalent product at Costco (Kirkland brand) at significantly lower price but was in Maine and far from one of thise stores so decided to try these from Olay since I do like many of their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Olay cloths are just okay. They are smallish and feel dry. My skin does not feel as clean or refreshed as it does with the Kirkland products, nor do I see any great beauty results:) not that I so from the Kirkland brand, either, though. I just use them as moistened facial towelettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be reordering these Olay towels again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these Olay wet cleansing pad for a few years and really do like them.,&lt;br /&gt;they are much better then the other brands that I have tried..</li>
            <li> I ordered these to replace the towelettes I&#x27;ve been ordering from a big box warehouse club when they changed their formula.  I do like the two sided cloths, but not sure they remove makeup as easily.  i did notice they do not dry my skin at all, which is what I&#x27;d expect from Olay.  This is a decent price for a good product, so I will probably order more.</li>
            <li> Have been very pleased with these cloths, easy to get out of the container and I like the way they get all the makeup off</li>
            <li> I rarely write a negative review but I felt I owed it to other people who are looking at these Olay cleansing cloths.  I had the following problems with these:  1)  Left a greasy film on my face and didn&#x27;t get off all of my mascara.  I ruined two nice quality white pillow cases before I figured out the problem was with these wipes.  I couldn&#x27;t even get the greasy film out the pillow cases.  As soon as I went back to my old wipes it didn&#x27;t happen again.  2) Made me break out.  My skin is adult acne prone and I&#x27;ve managed it very well.  These wipes were making me break out again.  I think it is that greasy film it was leaving on my face.  What good is a cleansing wipe if I have to wash my face after I use it?  I need the wipes as a time saver when I&#x27;m getting ready for bed.  Unfortunately, I purchased a three pack of these based on the positive reviews.  I&#x27;ll be throwing away 2 1/2 packages because I wouldn&#x27;t even give these away.  It&#x27;s a shame because I normally have good luck with Olay products.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe my face actually feels clean and moisturized without using traditional cleansers and water followed by a moisturizer! I rarely get blemishes anymore since using these, and my face is never taught or dry. Normally I would forgo washing my face at night when I was exhausted, but now I just grab one of these handy towelettes and quickly do something good for my skin!</li>
            <li> This was my first attempt to use cleansing sheets so I felt the smell was abit strong so not so good not so bad!!!!It was ok.</li>
            <li> excellent, cleans and moisturizes at the same time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for over a year now and will continue they really helps my skin to look youthful so many people tells me how beautify my skin look.. These are a must have.. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This product does everything it says it will. My face feels smooth and clean after using the wipe. It does not feel dry and brittle. I some times have to use more than one cloth to get all my makeup off.</li>
            <li> I started using these a few weeks ago and noticed within a day or two that I started breaking out. I stopped using them for several days and then used them again last night and the night before and once again I have the mother of all zits popping through. I rarely have acne and I have used just about every other brand of face cloth out there and only ths one makes me break out. These will be going in the trash!</li>
            <li> Like it - dont love it.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of my skin after using these. Clean,  not too greasy or too dry. I think after using for a few weeks,  it seems like it had been good for my complexion also. I have combination skin and it works great.</li>
            <li> I second everything the other people said. They are perfect for my combination skin, not too oily or too dry. Plus I do believe they make my skin look more youthful. I&#x27;m thirty and though I&#x27;m not old I do have a few wrinkles around my eyes and my complexion can look a little lifeless at times, I&#x27;ve found the cure!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product every night for the past four years. I absolutely love it because it is so moisturizing as well as cleansing. Now my 14-year-old daughter is also using it nightly and absolutely loves it as well. She has mentioned several times how nice her skin is compared to some of her classmates.</li>
            <li> I use these every night before going to bed.  My husband uses a CPAP machine and has oily skin.  I now have him using them as well and they help keep his face clean and get a good seal with his mask.  I love most of the Olay products, but find these cloth wipes very helpful when you need to wash your face quickly.  They are very good at removing make up.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with how well these cloths remove makeup.  The cloths are soft and thick and large enough to need only one per cleansing.  They are scented, but I don&#x27;t find the scent overwhelming or bothersome, and I&#x27;m a person who can&#x27;t tolerate strong perfumes.  The label on the top peels back to uncover an opening that lets you remove the cloths and then reseals well to prevent the cloths from drying out.</li>
            <li> Use these things every single night to wipe off thick, cream foundation. I dont use it to remove eye makeup, but as far as getting my skin clean before bed, thse things are all that I have used for several years. Keeps my combination skin moisturized after wiping, and I feel good going to bed after quick use of two wipes a night.&lt;br /&gt;Makes my bedtime routine so much easier, especially when Im really tired!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive tried many other wipes, and none compare to these. Will not leave your face feeling tight and dry, highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I like cleansing wipes, and tried these because of the price. However, they are not very good at removing makeup. I&#x27;ve gone back to the other Olay Daily Facial cloths, which are MUCH more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This gets my makeup off quickly and with little fuss. I like it. I don&#x27;t find it dries out at all, but I use one at least 5 nights/week so might go through them more quickly them some. I like this product.</li>
            <li> Love these - super convenient and gently removes makeup so well - store upside down so that the top ones stay moist - it keeps them from getting too wet on the bottom/dry on the top.  Great product!</li>
            <li> These work great and smell lovely.  Took off all makeup and my skin felt soft after.  Perfect if you don&#x27;t have time to wash your face.  One caveat is that my sensitive skin HATED them.  It wasn&#x27;t a reflection on the product they worked really, really well and I gave them to my mother and she has raved about them since.  Just my skin.  I posted 5 stars because they work and I loved them.  My mother loves them.  My grandmother has bought them.</li>
            <li> I like these okay, I don&#x27;t love them.  The size is good and the texture strong.  They remove makeup and mineral-based sun screen well.  They don&#x27;t remove eye makeup, however.  I always have to add some eye makeup remover or baby oil to the Olay cloth to get the eye makeup off.  So, they&#x27;re just okay.</li>
            <li> I really like these wipes.  The cloth is a little larger than some and I like that.  Also, they are moist enough to get the makeup off.</li>
            <li> I am in love with these wipes.  I use one even after I was my face with soap!  They leave my skin feeling silky smooth and not greasy.  After I use it on my face I rub them on the backs of my hands, which were beginning to show a little age (I&#x27;m 60) and it noticeably helps!  I have not been able to find the Total Effects in any store so was so glad to find them on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I LOVE these things. My face feels so clean after I use them and looks brighter, too.</li>
            <li> I feel like I need to wipe down face after I use these. Does not serve the purpose I bought them for</li>
            <li> I seriously doubt that these make me look any younger, but they clean my face and remove my makeup easily as expected.  If the price continues to be lower than drug store prices I will continue to buy these!</li>
            <li> The cloth is overall very good.  It&#x27;s soft, has aging treatments in it, and seals nicely.  It does require quite a few passes to remove my mascara.  It is waterproof mascara, to be fair, but I&#x27;ve had other cloths work better.  It also stings my eyes just a tiny bit, perhaps because I have to work it in so much for it to be effective.  The price is good, however, and I will continue to use them for now.</li>
            <li> Well, it doesn&#x27;t claim to be a makeup remover, and it&#x27;s not. Even though other reviewers said so, it doesn&#x27;t remove make up fully.It does remove eye make up easily, but my foundation only comes off about 80%. The cloth is soft, and softer than the olay regular make up remover cloths. Scrubbing with this cloth doesn&#x27;t make my sensitive, acne prone skin red. It didn&#x27;t worsen my acne, and left my skin feeling hydrated. Although, after I gave my face a quick rinse with water, my oily skin breathed better. I&#x27;m guessing people with dryer skin will love this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the total effects moisturizer so this will be in my kit when I travel. otherwise, I think I&#x27;ll stick to my regular Olay clean effects for make up removal.</li>
            <li> Good price, will order the 3-pack again.</li>
            <li> After using the CVS brand of this product, I decided to buy the real brand. I am very disappointed with the Olay product. The cloth is rough on my face and is not very wet. I will go back to the CVS brand...soft cloth and very wet? And CVS brand is half the price</li>
            <li> Love these cloths.  They go everywhere with me.</li>
            <li> I like the simplicity and effectiveness of these cleansing cloths. I don&#x27;t use makeup or soap, just cleansing and moisturizers, so I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s good for removing cosmetics; however, these keep my skin looking and feeling clean and healthy, which is what I want.</li>
            <li> Overall, great purchase, great value, &amp; I highly recommend it.  They are not perfect at getting all eye makeup off, but they&#x27;ll do the trick right before bed (and any eye makeup left over washes off the next morning in the shower).  I keep them on my nightstand with my night cream so I remember to use my face cream at night.  Otherwise, without the wipes, I&#x27;m bad about washing my face on a nightly basis &amp; if I&#x27;m not using my night cream, it&#x27;s not going to work.  This is a great addition to my routine.</li>
            <li> texture is great, fragrance is awesome, I don&#x27;t know how much it changed the skin of my face but it definitely makes the face fresh. I like it, will buy it again.</li>
            <li> ...as a cloth to refresh your face while applying a light layer of facial cream.  These cloths are smooth and don&#x27;t really feel like they&#x27;re cleaning my face as much as pushing dirt around.  They do remove makeup eventually, even my waterproof mascara, but it takes a LOT of rubbing and uses a lot of the cloth to get it all off.  Not my first choice for that purpose...I prefer Ponds Evening Soothe over these.</li>
            <li> I have been using Oil of Olay products for years and wanted something that I could use to cleanse my face instead of a facial cleanser that needed rinsing . It cleans thoroughly taking off makeup easily and leaving a soft feel to the face. Highly recommended for older complexions.</li>
            <li> I have used these Oil of Olay wipes for years.  Recently, I bought an off-brand as the Olay wipes were temporarily out of stock.  OMGoodness, what a mistake!  For an entire week, my eyes \\&quot;wept\\&quot; because of the offensive, soapy, extra-wet wipes.  Never again will I use anything besides these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Easy on the eyes... no strong astringent or harsh cleanser on these wipes&lt;br /&gt;Blimishes are rare when using these wipes consistently&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;A bit pricier than off-brand but WELL worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes out of stock due to its popularity</li>
            <li> Left undesirable film on skin after using.</li>
            <li> I use these all the time. My face is still combination but more n the dry. I feel fresh and moist after using these.</li>
            <li> I purchased these based on my mom&#x27;s recommendation.  They clean very well and even have a slight exfoliating and tingling effect.  The only issue I&#x27;m having is that they seem to dry out my skin around my mouth and nose.  I gave my 2 unopened packages to my mom since they work so well for her.</li>
            <li> I like that these Olay Total Effects Age Defying Cleansing Cloths leave the skin soft.  However, sometimes I&#x27;m not sure the residue from the day&#x27;s activities is completely gone, and I feel the need to rinse with hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terry</li>
            <li> My mom is 87, and has trouble getting around with her walker after three back surgeries in the past 15 years. These cloths are great for her in many ways. First of all, they clean her skin and keep it soft. But these are also really great for her because she can sit in her easy chair and just pull them out of the cabinet drawer and wash her face. Bending over a sink to cleanse with soap and water is just too hard for her to do.</li>
            <li> love it and it does not break me out</li>
            <li> I like these, they leave my skin feeling so nice! And they aren&#x27;t overly-perfumed. They are a little dry though.</li>
            <li> Good for traveling and limited room to bring bottles and tubes of facial cleansing and moisturizing.  Does a nice of job of cleaning off  makeup and light moisturizing.  One side is textured for cleaning and the other smooth.  Price for three is cheapest I&#x27;ve found over regular grocery stores.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of these.  I really like them because they seem to get all my makeup off and doesn&#x27;t give me acne.  There&#x27;s no strong smell, and it feels gentle (like if you did have acne or something it wouldn&#x27;t burn.)</li>
            <li> have used OLAY products for 35 yrs  this is a great one,cleans face while moisturizing,,also use olay moisturizers,among other products from olay</li>
            <li> Ever since I &amp;#34;discovered&amp;#34; this product, I have used nothing else to clean my face at night. it takes all my make up off and leaves it ready for my night treatment.</li>
            <li> When I am too tired to do a complete cleansing with my Olay Products, I will use the Olay Wet Cleansing Cloths.  They are very handy as well as refreshing.  The price I paid was satisfactory.  I will purchase them again when I have depleted my supply.  Also, I travel and they are great  to put in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> These are the only makeup remover wipes that I like to use.  my skin is sensitive and these work perfect for me.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I will be subscribing to these with the subscribe and save option on Amazon. I love facewipes because sometimes I just need something to keep by my bed at night when I am too tired to wash my face. I have tried at least 10 different kinds of facewipes (Ponds, Neutrogena, Garnier, Loreal, Roc, etc) and these are my favorite by far. They stay moist in the package, remove even waterproof make-up well, and leave my face felling moisturized, rather than dry. LOVE THEM!</li>
            <li> These are great at removing my face makeup and my eye makeup...and one is enough to accomplish both.  My face doesn&#x27;t break out or get irritated from the ingredients either.  I&#x27;ll definitely buy these again.</li>
            <li> I love these. Especially after coming home on a hot day or when I&#x27;m too lazy to wash my face before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs:&lt;br /&gt;It cleans my face well without drying me out or irritating my face. -- I have somewhat sensitive skin so this is very important to me.&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice and I find that I dont even need to use face lotion afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;It is cheaper to get the 3-pack now that Target has jacked-up their prices on Olay products...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont wear makeup so I cannot attest to whether or not these are good at removing makeup. I doubt it though... When I do wear makeup, I use MAC Wipes Cleansing Towelettes [http://www.amazon.com/Bulk-Wipes-Cleansing-Towelettes-Sheets/dp/B004J90ZMQ/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_sbs_bt_1] but they sting my sensitive skin and I have to wash my face afterwards. Still  its better than scrubbing my makeup off with facewash (I use Olay Total Effects Blemish Control Salicylic Acid Acne Cleanser [http://www.amazon.com/Olay-Effects-Blemish-Salicylic-Cleanser/dp/B003AVNLLQ/ref&#x3D;sr_1_5?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1358790833&amp;sr&#x3D;1-5&amp;keywords&#x3D;olay+facewash]) alone. For eye makeup remover, I use Mary Kay Oil-Free Eye Makeup Remover [http://www.amazon.com/Mary-Kay-Oil-Free-Makeup-Remover/dp/B000QUM5LG] and Q-Tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on my experience with the MAC wipes, I&#x27;ve gotten into the habit of turning any wipes that come in similar packaging upside down to keep them from drying out. I can&#x27;t say for sure if this a also a problem with the Olay Wipes, but they don&#x27;t dry out when I do.</li>
            <li> These are very good for taking of makeup.</li>
            <li> Very handy packaging, cleans skin well and is refreshing to use</li>
            <li> Awesome cleansing cloths!!</li>
            <li> These work great, especially at taking off stubborn mascara. They leave my face smooth and don&#x27;t cause any breakouts. Huge win in my book. The wipes have a subtle scent, so it&#x27;s not overpowering when you&#x27;re cleaning your face.</li>
            <li> my skin seems softer already. Though I usually buy unscented products becaus of allergies, these cloths have a pleeasant scent the doesn&#x27;t affect me adversely. I&#x27;m happy I ordered them.</li>
            <li> very good deal.  have been using these since they came out.</li>
            <li> I love these wipes as I use Olay products for my facial upkeep.  These work great because they do not leave any sticky or oily feeling after you use them and they are great makeup removers when you don&#x27;t feel like actually washing your face.</li>
            <li> Go here quick!  Good buy.</li>
