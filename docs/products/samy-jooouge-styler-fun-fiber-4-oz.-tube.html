            <li>Love it!!!</li>
            <li>I just love it!!!</li>

            <li>- the product is great</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>

            <li>Good product, delivered on time.</li>
            <li>I was very satisfied with this transaction</li>
            <li>Jooouge gives me nice, separate tendrils of bouncy hair and no late-afternoon frizzies.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it works best on completely straight hair.</li>
            <li>have used it for years now and am so glad that it is now available on Amazon at a great price.</li>
            <li>Fun Fiber is great for super-fine hair.  </li>
            <li>This is the absolute best hair styler for fine hair. . .</li>
            <li>Smells nice too, kinda like Juicy Fruit gum, but the scent isn&#x27;t annoyingly strong and fades after a while.</li>
            <li>I love it, it makes my hair more manageable and not out of control.</li>
            <li>Better than Ouidad, better than Devacurl, and better than Catwalk&#x27;s Curls Rock (my 2nd best gel).  </li>
            <li>The product is just okay.</li>
            <li>Gives great body and holds styles very well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li>I had better luck with products I got from the dollar store and CVS.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, I have curly hair</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I receive many compliments and I believe some of it is due to this wonderful product</li>
            <li>I have used this for a very long time ,ordering from HSN years ago .it is perfect for fine haired people</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best styling gel for my naturally curly hair (type 3b according to [...].  </li>
            <li>Gives lots of volume and control, easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>No bad hair days any more.</li>
            <li>I love this product but the first time I used it the styling cream came out of the bottom of the container at the seams.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok just that when u clap hands doesn&#x27;t really make the fibers, stays stickey.  </li>
            <li>The video and advertisements definitely overrate the product, as I&#x27;m sure there are many over the counter hair products that work just as well.</li>
            <li>The Fun Fiber is a really super product.  </li>
            <li>The only pros I can say it has is a nice smell.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best product for short hair,it spikes, seperates and defines your style without making it greasy or wet looking.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I wish I would have listened to the ones that weren&#x27;t so positive.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>and I received it very promptly.</li>
            <li>and it really helps style my curls.</li>
            <li>My fine thin hair can&#x27;t take this type of product and although it did sort of make it more bouncy within like two hours</li>
            <li>Jooouge is my main hair product now.</li>
            <li>Had to transfer product into a new container.</li>
            <li>My hair has a natural wave to it</li>
            <li>As it first dries, I do get some crunch, but if I let it loosen naturally rather than breaking it up, my curls hold up all day long.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff but it appeared to be a little old because it is really hard to squeeze out.</li>
            <li>I am so upset I wasted so much money on jooouge since it doesn&#x27;t do anything to make my hair look better and actually makes my hair look worse.</li>
            <li>I really like them - take up less space on my bathroom counter....  </li>

            <li> I really like them - take up less space on my bathroom counter....  </li>
            <li> I bought this product from one of those HSN type infomercials/specials and after seeing a live demonstration by Samy on several models I got excited and bought it for my horribly limp thin wavy hair.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still a pretty thick product.</li>
            <li> It helps me all day long while I am at work.</li>
            <li> I do want to say that it gives my hair volume and hold since my hair is very thin and fine.  </li>
            <li> my hair was back to normal except with a dirty feeling residue all over it.</li>
            <li> only complaint is the seam of the tube ruptured.</li>
            <li> It just laid flat, lifeless and dull looking.  </li>
            <li> If you do have thin hair be very careful that you only use a pin-sized amount as this product does tend to make hair look a bit greasy.</li>
            <li> It gives my hair the All Day height that I want without a stiff or sticky feeling</li>
            <li> I also haven&#x27;t broken out from it like other \\&quot;fiber/pomade\\&quot; styling types.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so thick</li>
            <li> makes me look like I have a thick head of hair.  </li>
            <li> It is also difficult to get out if you have arthritis since the cream is really thick.</li>
            <li> The cons were it made my hair limp and look dirty.</li>
            <li> A little disappointed.  </li>
            <li> :-(</li>
            <li> Too bad!</li>
            <li> So disappointed!</li>
            <li> This is the worst styling product I ever used.  </li>

            <li> I love this stuff but it appeared to be a little old because it is really hard to squeeze out.</li>
            <li> This yummy-smelling fiber based hair goo/gel is my go to stuff when my hair has the droopy blahs.</li>
            <li> I love it, it makes my hair more manageable and not out of control. I also haven&#x27;t broken out from it like other \\&quot;fiber/pomade\\&quot; styling types.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best styling gel for my naturally curly hair (type 3b according to [...].  Better than Ouidad, better than Devacurl, and better than Catwalk&#x27;s Curls Rock (my 2nd best gel).  Jooouge gives me nice, separate tendrils of bouncy hair and no late-afternoon frizzies.  As it first dries, I do get some crunch, but if I let it loosen naturally rather than breaking it up, my curls hold up all day long.  Smells nice too, kinda like Juicy Fruit gum, but the scent isn&#x27;t annoyingly strong and fades after a while.</li>
            <li> I love this product but the first time I used it the styling cream came out of the bottom of the container at the seams.  Had to transfer product into a new container. It is also difficult to get out if you have arthritis since the cream is really thick. Samy needs to come out with a different container to put it in.  I would have given this a 5 star if I did not have problems with the container.  I do want to say that it gives my hair volume and hold since my hair is very thin and fine.  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> The product is just okay. If you do have thin hair be very careful that you only use a pin-sized amount as this product does tend to make hair look a bit greasy. The video and advertisements definitely overrate the product, as I&#x27;m sure there are many over the counter hair products that work just as well. Probably won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from one of those HSN type infomercials/specials and after seeing a live demonstration by Samy on several models I got excited and bought it for my horribly limp thin wavy hair. So disappointed! It&#x27;s so thick and it just ended up tangling my hair and making it all sticky. I tried adding some sprinkles of water onto my palms to dilute it but it&#x27;s still a pretty thick product. My fine thin hair can&#x27;t take this type of product and although it did sort of make it more bouncy within like two hours my hair was back to normal except with a dirty feeling residue all over it. Too bad! Maybe it works best on completely straight hair. :-( It does smell great though.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair. This stuff makes my hair look thicker and fuller. However I wish Samy would let Walgreens carry this product as he does his hair spray, shampoo etc.</li>
            <li> Fun Fiber is great for super-fine hair.  Gives great body and holds styles very well.  A body perm in a tube if you will.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best hair styler for fine hair. . . makes me look like I have a thick head of hair.  I just love it!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I have been using it since my mom introduced it to me. Jooouge is my main hair product now. It helps me all day long while I am at work. No bad hair days any more. Jooouge to the rescue. Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> This is the worst styling product I ever used.  I followed the directions yet got no results.  The only pros I can say it has is a nice smell.  The cons were it made my hair limp and look dirty. My hair has a natural wave to it and I was hoping jooouge would help it look bouncy. I kept scrunching my hair to no avail. It just laid flat, lifeless and dull looking.  I had better luck with products I got from the dollar store and CVS.  I can&#x27;t believe the postive reviews I have read and I wish I would have listened to the ones that weren&#x27;t so positive.  I am so upset I wasted so much money on jooouge since it doesn&#x27;t do anything to make my hair look better and actually makes my hair look worse.</li>
            <li> Good product, delivered on time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok just that when u clap hands doesn&#x27;t really make the fibers, stays stickey.  Had it before and when u clapped hands had lots of fibers and wasn&#x27;t this stickey.  A little disappointed.  Besides they sent me 2 which I didn&#x27;t want.  Didn&#x27;t want to pay restocking fees etc.  so I kept it.  Probably will not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and for my hairstyle it works perfectly. I receive many compliments and I believe some of it is due to this wonderful product</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product for short hair,it spikes, seperates and defines your style without making it greasy or wet looking.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for years now and am so glad that it is now available on Amazon at a great price.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ever want to know what I would do without it! It gives my hair the All Day height that I want without a stiff or sticky feeling</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Gives lots of volume and control, easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the seam of the tube ruptured.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a very long time ,ordering from HSN years ago .it is perfect for fine haired people</li>
            <li> This came in different packaging - 4 one ounce bottles - which the seller put in the advertisement.  I really like them - take up less space on my bathroom counter....  The Fun Fiber is a really super product.  I was very satisfied with this transaction - the product is great and I received it very promptly.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have curly hair and it really helps style my curls. I would buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barbara</li>
            <li> love it. have used it for years, give the back of my short hair body</li>
            <li> Great product.  I was happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
