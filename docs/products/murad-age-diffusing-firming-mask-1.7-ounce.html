            <li>The Murad Resurgence Firming Mask is an okay mask....</li>
            <li>I have used masks for many years</li>
            <li>This is supposed to be a firming  but feels a bit more like putting on a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>YOU WILL LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>It feels clean and healthy.  </li>
            <li>i have been using Murad for years and amazon has the best prices- even less than Ulta.i</li>
            <li>Makes me feel great to use same products my esthetician uses.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and that&#x27;s a good thing -</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried A LOT (Bliss oxygen mask, Sanitas vita rich mask, Boscia brightening mask, Murad environmental shield peel, MyChelle apple brightening peel, Burt&#x27;s Bees intense hydration mask, Dr. Perricone chlro plasma mask, Eminence chocolate &amp; Acai masks, Zuri by sleek Chapter Eight Brightening mask, Meaningful Beauty by Cindy Crawford RICH MOISTURE MASQUE MASK etc).</li>
            <li>get  facials at massage envy and this one is pretty good when I cannot get a professional one done...same murad products</li>
            <li>I need more time to really know.</li>
            <li>I requested a full refund</li>
            <li>It is still new to me and I am sure it will take time.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite Murad product and believe me....</li>
            <li>When I first started to use this</li>
            <li>I am in love for what it has done to my skin and facial tone..</li>
            <li>I saw a difference after the first use and</li>
            <li>I had friends ask me if I was doing something different and that my skin looked so healthy and it glowed.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it is because I&#x27;m constantly doing a mask every day.  </li>
            <li>BUT when you wash it off, you can certainly feel and see the difference.</li>
            <li>Definitely notice reduction of fine lines.</li>
            <li>have learned that you really have to stick with one brand to notice a difference in your skin.</li>
            <li>My skin feels like silk after I use it and it just makes my skin so much smoother.  </li>
            <li>Really works well.</li>
            <li>It looks refreshed, smooth and the pores are smaller.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Murad!</li>
            <li>however I dont really see anything</li>
            <li>I use this particular</li>
            <li>If you have old skin, this does help!  </li>
            <li>I will go directly to Ulta to purchase this product.  </li>
            <li>And, my skin felt softer than soft.  </li>
            <li>my school kids who think 40 is REALLY old guess my age at 45 or 50.  </li>
            <li>Nothing super noticeable after using it a few weeks.  </li>

            <li> This stuff is awesome</li>
            <li> When I first started to use this I thought it was the same as others I have bought and was disappointed but I used it a few times a week as recommended. It is hard to describe what the difference is in my skin but it looks good! I will order more.</li>
            <li> i have been using Murad for years and amazon has the best prices- even less than Ulta.i have learned that you really have to stick with one brand to notice a difference in your skin.</li>

            <li> I use the entire line of product.  I am in love for what it has done to my skin and facial tone..</li>

            <li> Excellent product - tightens and firms I have a more youthful appearance to my skin!! Love it!</li>
            <li> Definitely notice reduction of fine lines.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Murad products for a couple of years now and absolutely love the way my complexion responds.  I use this particular&lt;br /&gt;mask once a week.</li>
            <li> Great product and good price</li>
            <li> get  facials at massage envy and this one is pretty good when I cannot get a professional one done...same murad products</li>
            <li> I received this product in December as a Xmas gift and it was defective as it came out as &amp;#34;water&amp;#34; .  I contacted the seller and they said they would replace the product.  They are out of stock and not good at communication at all throughout this process.  I had to constantly contact them to get updates.  I requested a full refund so I could purchase the product elsewhere.  Again, I have to constantly contact them with NO SUCCESS in receiving my credit yet.  This has been going on for over 4 weeks.  I will go directly to Ulta to purchase this product.  I did not save the $20 as initially thought, as I had to pay $8 to ship the product back and have been nothing but trouble in obtaining either the product and/or my credit.  SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY FROM THIS SELLER !</li>
            <li> The Murad Resurgence products work fairly well on my skin.  I&#x27;ve used the cleanser, the night creme and the eye creme.  This Firming Mask is OK.  It leaves my skin soft and that&#x27;s a good thing - but that&#x27;s about all.  I probably won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love using this mask. After just 10 minutes you can see a big difference in your skin. It looks refreshed, smooth and the pores are smaller. Very good product.</li>
            <li> The Murad Resurgence Firming Mask is an okay mask....not one that you can feel drawing your face tight etc. BUT when you wash it off, you can certainly feel and see the difference. As with all Murad products, they are the best.</li>
            <li> Saw a result immediately.  And, my skin felt softer than soft.  I am skeptical by nature, but this really provided instant results I could see and feel.  I will be giving this to my women friends and family for the holidays, cuz everyone can use a little beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fab product. Will definitely buy again!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used masks for many years but Murad Age-Diffusing Firming Mask is the best!  I saw a difference after the first use and after on 3 uses I had friends ask me if I was doing something different and that my skin looked so healthy and it glowed.  It goes on clear and only takes 10 minutes. I highly recommend Murad!</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff for years and it works.  I am 68 and my school kids who think 40 is REALLY old guess my age at 45 or 50.  It is a good regime.</li>
            <li> This is supposed to be a firming  but feels a bit more like putting on a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Very expensive for the results.</li>
            <li> I like this mask.  I mean I use so much stuff - my skin looks great (I&#x27;m 34) and I&#x27;m sure it is because I&#x27;m constantly doing a mask every day.  But this is one of the best masks I&#x27;ve ever tried and I&#x27;ve tried A LOT (Bliss oxygen mask, Sanitas vita rich mask, Boscia brightening mask, Murad environmental shield peel, MyChelle apple brightening peel, Burt&#x27;s Bees intense hydration mask, Dr. Perricone chlro plasma mask, Eminence chocolate &amp; Acai masks, Zuri by sleek Chapter Eight Brightening mask, Meaningful Beauty by Cindy Crawford RICH MOISTURE MASQUE MASK etc). This is a good one for moisture, anti aging, firming, all that.  Try it!</li>
            <li> The best - firms well and in five minutes.</li>
            <li> IF YOU HAVE ANY BLACK HEADS IN YOUR SKIN  IT WILL GET RID OF THEM SOON. YOU WILL LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I saw that the reviews were very good.  I have used it a few times however I dont really see anything&lt;br /&gt;big as of yet.  It is still new to me and I am sure it will take time.</li>
