    <ol>
            <li>I am very happy with the razors as the price of it is the cheapest around.</li>
            <li>Got this package in the mail, wrapped in a plastic envelope/bag in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>Again excellent value.</li>
            <li>In that sense it is perfect.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been getting great shaves!</li>
            <li>The razor blades are very good quality, which I had hoped for given Derby appeared to be a &amp;#34;known&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>But, it was a very good started razor.</li>
            <li>Great product and wonderful seller.</li>

            <li>Great buy.</li>
            <li>This is a great bargain.</li>
            <li>shave after shave...very happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>it is a great buy</li>
            <li>He loves it, says it works great.</li>
            <li>The experience was great</li>
            <li>Great for the money.</li>
            <li>Great saver of time and money, and</li>
            <li>Razor was very nice even being very cheap, but still an awesome product.</li>
            <li>I use Derby blades in my Safety DE razor and love them, so I suspect that the Derby blades in this package are excellent.</li>
            <li>but it does work good.</li>
            <li>The accompanying razor is quite good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll find a good razor to replace this one.</li>
            <li>I came across this deal and figured it was too good to pass up.</li>
            <li>No, the blades are great and the razor is as described and effective.</li>
            <li>but i rate the blades as good quality.</li>
            <li>though I could do is get a good shave</li>
            <li>and I thought it would be a good tool to trim my beard lines.  </li>
            <li>no so good</li>
            <li>but it works good.</li>
            <li>i did not see a defect it is good for home use.</li>
            <li>Good price for what you get.</li>
            <li>Will be finding a good home for the blades tho.</li>
            <li>As I said before I do recommend Shark but that is just for my skin, best to try different blades and find what suits you best.</li>
            <li>The first use of the razor did not go perfect but that was not</li>
            <li>Nice beginners razor.</li>
            <li>With these Derby blades there is no need for that kind of nonsense.  </li>
            <li>Of course that title is my own opinion of this product.</li>
            <li>I liked it, i would recommend practicing without the blade</li>
            <li>Most times I shave WTG once and call it a day - which feels great and is 100x better than an electric shave.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made of plastic, but everything holds together nicely.</li>
            <li>but i think if you want to see if you want to use a straight razor to shave with this will do the trick perfectly for money you spend i love the idea of the changeable blades and it comes with 100 of them</li>
            <li>works good, it&#x27;s lightweight so to me it fills easy to control.</li>
            <li>and it is very easy to handle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good for practicing and learning the ins and outs of straight razor shaving.</li>
            <li>Cheap and good</li>
            <li>Great shiping and gets the job done right its worth what you pay for, great for edge ups and mustache lining</li>
            <li>great blades that fit easily into my razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I will get better the more I prctice too!</li>
            <li>So, this is a great value for a beginning straight shaver!</li>
            <li>When I saw the price, I thought it might be too good to be true, I was right.&lt;br /&gt;Remember</li>
            <li>It gets the job done, but the handle is very light and flimsy feeling.  </li>
            <li>it has great tutorials on straight edge shaving.</li>
            <li>There is a better blades</li>
            <li>probably one of the more sturdy plastic shavers you can buy.</li>
            <li>that you&#x27;re probably going to be using this on your face or hairline, take the time to invest in something better.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>and he said he likes it more.</li>
            <li>it may look flimsy when you take it out of the package, but it holds a blade very well, and works great.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>100 blades and a free bonus razor!</li>
            <li>you will undoubtedly find yourself enjoying a nice, cheap, manly shave.</li>
            <li>This shaves so much better than the electric</li>
            <li>given he never used on before I though better to start with this and move up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of those things that you have to man up to get better at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it would have been better if they had forgotten it.</li>
            <li>All in all, it makes a great introduction to straight shaving.</li>
            <li>I bought these after reading some reviews and was glad I did.</li>
            <li>Great product I used it a couple time its great you pretty much pay for what you get a great razor but isnt very sturdy where you place the blade over a good razor also fast shiped</li>
            <li>nice clean shave</li>
            <li>I think for my first Straight Edge razor this was the best to get.</li>
            <li>This razor came fast and was easy to use and worked great.</li>
            <li>Even with me not using correct lather it still shaved pretty good.</li>
            <li>Package came quickly and the product is an amazing value for the price.</li>
            <li>The blades are definitely not the best I&#x27;ve used, but they&#x27;re cheap.  </li>
            <li>Clean cut!</li>
            <li>OKAY cause the product is soo cheap.</li>
            <li>Also good to introduce friends to straight razor because you can change blades.</li>
            <li>People say the straight razor is flimsy, I think its fairly sturdy.</li>
            <li>The razor is easy to use and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>its easy to use for maintaining beard and side burn.</li>
            <li>they are easy to install into my shavette and seem to never run out.</li>
            <li>the blades were easy to install and the razor was easy to use.</li>
            <li>The blades are not sharp at all, when I got them I thought it was a great deal as I tried them</li>
            <li>My first shave was amazing, but then I saw some blades that came with the razor in a side pouch of the case.  </li>
            <li>I have used this set up to learn the art of straight razor shaving, and I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>All in all, it&#x27;s an inexpensive shavette and pretty darned effective.</li>
            <li>The razor gave me a good clean shave and for a first time user of a straight razor of any kind I didn&#x27;t wound myself or suffer and razor burns</li>
            <li>bought these blades on line because i needed them to help clean my smooth top stove--which wears out blades</li>
            <li>the others are fine..</li>
            <li>ALL IS FINE.</li>
            <li>I got this at a great price for my first straight razor.</li>
            <li>but this works fine.</li>
            <li>i really like this alot its kind of cheap filling when your holding it because its so light</li>
            <li>Included was a straight nice strait razor.</li>
            <li>I liked that it came with a straight razor.</li>
            <li>The shaver handle/body is plastic and maybe aluminum (?), and is quite light.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s SO smooth.  </li>
            <li>Because it was so cheap, I was expecting it to be just a cheap knock off with some blades.</li>
            <li>I got my razor for free for buying the blades.</li>
            <li>Sharp and a very good deal.</li>
            <li>In short, it works very nicely.</li>
            <li>It was my husband&#x27;s first straight blade and he loved it</li>
            <li>These blades are as good as any and better fitting than those that have to be snapped in half.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure since this is the first SR I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>The handle is very light, but since it&#x27;s a freebie with the blades, I can&#x27;t really complain,</li>
            <li>However when I am using it (mostly) right I still get pretty rough razor burn and at best I get a shave that is as close as my DE.  </li>
            <li>BUT, it held the blade securely and I was able to get a decent shave - knicks and cuts on face - u bet, but that was not the razor&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li>They work great and if you find that you don&#x27;t like using a straight razor you have not spent alot of money.</li>
            <li>Would love to have a 100.00 straight razor</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s less than $10 for a razor and 100 good blades, what more do you want?  </li>
            <li>It works perfectly, but I wouldn&#x27;t anticipate it lasting too long, but for the cost, it&#x27;s a fantastic value.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty flimsy, but it works just fine.  </li>
            <li>If you want to get into straight razor shaving but feel intimated by the cost, this is a great low cost solution.</li>
            <li>That quickly changed.</li>
            <li>These came really quick.</li>
            <li>But be VERY careful, as manufactured blades, even the milder ones, will cut you up nicely if you don&#x27;t have a very light touch and no pressure at all.</li>
            <li>The shavette is working great until I get the technique down.  </li>
            <li>but I still felt the urge to try it out, and I was pretty surprised how good the bonus straight razor worked.</li>
            <li>a straight razor shave a try, this is a fine product.</li>
            <li>When I am brave again and this little nick is healed I will have another go at it.</li>
            <li>Whilst it took a bit of thinking to figure out how it worked, as no instructions were provided, the sliding blade receptacle holds the blade quite securely and provides an exceedingly functional beginner&#x27;s straight blade shaving device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Already I enjoy the routine and meditation, not to mention the closeness, of shaving with a straight.</li>
            <li>The blade holder is simple but effective.</li>
            <li>for the price its worth it.</li>
            <li>but id say worth the value</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t worth messing with- throw it away.  </li>
            <li>Of course, a lot of people hold up True straight razors as the one true way toshave and may not like a shavette.</li>
            <li>Buy this its soooo worth the money.</li>
            <li>have to find a brand that is just right for ur own skin not the fault of the razor they should make a sample pack with 10 of each different blades</li>
            <li>Other wise amazing product for the low price.</li>
            <li>ThDerby Professional blades deliver a smooth clean shave...</li>
            <li>are sharp and seem to maintain their edge for a good bit of time.</li>
            <li>The blades are sharp really good all around.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>on top just not sharp at all</li>
            <li>The razor that came with the blades was actually of a better quality than another I purchased at the same time thinking if this was almost free the next would be better.</li>
            <li>But actually, it is exactly what was described and what it is monetarily worth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a DE razor user for about 6 months now and in my Tech, which is a rather mild shaver, I absolutely despise Derby blades.</li>
            <li>I bought a better razor from a shop near me and it works very well, spend the money for the quality.</li>
            <li>the only thing i dont like is how easy the blade holder slides out  but other than that its good</li>
            <li>Derby&#x27;s are my second favorite safety razor blade.</li>
            <li>The first razor blade cut me all over..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve evr used</li>
            <li>Also, maybe watch a youtube video or two first.</li>
            <li>the first two shaves.</li>
            <li>how I got myself the first time)</li>
            <li>The razor shaver fell apart after I used it the first time.</li>
            <li>i was only able to make one pass with this thing before I tossed the handle in the bin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my first box of Derby blades for a while now, and it gives me a feeling of never running out of blades again.</li>
            <li>It has a much better feel in my hand compared to the Parker Stainless Steel straight razor (which is only barely metal and mostly plastic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>they are nice and sharp and take care of business :0</li>
            <li>I know that i shaved with it for the first time today had been interested in try to learn to shave with a straight razor for some time just didn&#x27;t want to spend alot of cash to try it.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using a straight razor.</li>
            <li>Using a straight razor for the first time, I was a bit nervous.</li>
            <li>Once you get past the learning curve, shaving actually becomes pretty enjoyable, and I have yet to have any problem with this product (that wasn&#x27;t my own fault).</li>
            <li>i love to shave with a single razor, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Can use each blade more than once, also is very sharp, well worth the money.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend and I had previously gotten him one from an Art of Shaving store at the mall and didn&#x27;t like how it didn&#x27;t sound like it was shaving, you know, that scraping sound?</li>
            <li>The light weight + the extra grab of the blade if you choose to shave against the grain of your beard makes it easy for the blade to &amp;#34;hop&amp;#34; against your face, which will leave your skin irritated and red.  </li>
            <li>Even if I didn&#x27;t end up loving it, I can find little to complain about at this price point.</li>
            <li>This is a nice little shavette style of razor that I&#x27;m getting started with in the world of straight shaving.</li>
            <li>The razor, while a little on the cheap side (plastic handle and sheet metal blade holder, you get what you pay for), stayed at the angle I put it which is the important thing.</li>
            <li>The only thing I really dislike is that when a blade is in the razor the corner is exposed, and if your not careful its very easy to cut yourself with that corner.</li>
            <li>So for under $6.00 I thought I would try a shavette straight razor</li>
            <li>It took a minute to figure out that the longer pips on each end of the blade holder need to stick out enough for the blade to go under so it is held securely.</li>
            <li>I just started using a straight razor and bought these blades to try out.  </li>
            <li>Gave them a try and reconsidered the whole straight razor \\&quot;thing\\&quot; until I put another Derby blade in.  </li>
            <li>Straight shaving takes practice, check out youtube</li>
            <li>this makes me want to really learn how strop a real quality razor</li>
            <li>If you are trying to decide if you want to start using a straight razor dont put out a ton of money.</li>
            <li>Thanks Again</li>
            <li>I purchased these for use in my Parker straight razor which accepts &amp;</li>
            <li>On something as aggressive as a shavette though, it&#x27;s an absolute boon.</li>
            <li>I like this straight razor.</li>
            <li>This absolutely can not be beat for the price.</li>
            <li>I have never tried a straight razor before</li>
            <li>so fast--</li>
            <li>However if you have never used a straight razor / shavette then you are in for a learning curve.  </li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really complain about the quality/price.</li>
            <li>I bought these when I bought a straight razor.</li>
            <li>Turns out Derby&#x27;s aren&#x27;t really for me, but for this price you can&#x27;t really go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The disposable blades are available at local walmart, drugstore, etc., or you can reorder here.</li>
            <li>Get one if you want to try straight razors.</li>
            <li>Straight razor works like a charm.</li>
            <li>The blades are a no brainer, but with the straight razor this is a must.</li>
            <li>I got the straight razor set today and immediately set out to test it.</li>
            <li>So far the Red Baron blades have not disappointed!</li>
            <li>I use different straight razors for for trimming and shaping,but this little guy is really safe and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>The straight razor is a pretty good item,but the blades are thin and flimsy.  </li>
            <li>The product is certainly cheap: the blades dull easily and I need to change them after every shave.  </li>
            <li>I called the customer service number and the person immediately shipped the right blades, but told me that the Red Baron blades are actually higher end.</li>
            <li>My first shave was done carefully as the only time a straight razor has touched me before was in the hands of my ever so skilled and trusted barber</li>
            <li>It gets me a great shave and this quantity should last me a couple of years....except I am still trying other blades out at the same time.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something to test the waters of straight shaving before spending a ridiculous amount of money on a actual blade, this is a great place to start.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I never have to break blades in half again.</li>
            <li>Much better than the sharks that I was previously using.</li>
            <li>I wanted to make sure that I could get used to straight shaving without destroying my skin, and it works just as well as I thought.</li>
            <li>Most people don&#x27;t use a straight Blade and they are missing out.</li>
            <li>After a couple of shaves I now have the hang of using this particular razor.</li>
            <li>the blades are nice no more braking in half and then losing the other half fit nice in my holder the free holder that comes with</li>
            <li>Buy this kit and give it a try before you buy a high end razor.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>the blades are sharp and smooth, but the handle as so much &amp;#34;wiggle room&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I decided to use a shavette like this, with replaceable blades, since I was just getting started with straight shaving and didn&#x27;t want to complicate matters with maintaining a sharp edge on a true straight razor.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little more time to shave, yes,</li>
            <li>so i never have to wait until its dull to change them out its kind of tricky sliding the blade into the holder</li>
            <li>In fact it may be a great kit for use year after year, there&#x27;s nothing really wrong with it.  </li>
            <li>, I am interested in purchasing a heavier handle or possibly a vintage straight blade.</li>
            <li>This is a low quality razor, suited to someone who knows exactly how to use a straight razor, not someone new to it.  </li>
            <li>No work to maintain blade, just change to a new one.</li>
            <li>So many in the box for so little money!</li>
            <li>Blades gave a very good shave, but might have a little trouble on longer facial hair.</li>
            <li>Though it is, as some describe, a light and cheap feeling razor I found nothing wrong with it and what can one really expect for the price.</li>
            <li>I decided to try straightrazor shaving, and this seemed a better idea than spending the required amount for an actual shaving quality razor to find out if I could do it without cutting my own throat.</li>
            <li>I managed to cut my facial hair pretty well after I got the hang of it.</li>
            <li>In most cases I can&#x27;t snap a normal DE blade to a half prettily enough to get it stucked to a shavette without separate blade holder.</li>
            <li>Now I can use both my old shavette without blade holder and a new one I got with my pack of Derbys.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shavette might rust if you leave it in a high humidity environment and dont wipe it off after use, but other than that is should work fine, especially for the low low price of pretty much free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only issue I have had is with my use of them, I&#x27;m new to using a straight blade to shave, and my face looks like I got into a fight with a cat on steroids...</li>
            <li>In the picture it was a white razor i received a black one which was even better.</li>
            <li>The holder slides out of the razor and reveals a little notched area for the blades to fit into.</li>
            <li>Just use a knife blade to pry them open a little more.</li>
            <li>Super sharp and the box contains a ton of them.</li>
            <li>Razors are super duper sharp.</li>
            <li>Straight razor shaving takes some practice butonce there, you&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
            <li>This combination of glasses and holder was the lowest price I could find anywhere by a considerable amount.</li>
            <li>I have been using a double edge (saftey razor) for a while and decided to dip my toe into the straight razor pool by trying out this inexpensive</li>
            <li>blade lasted ~3 months of frequent use so in about 300 months</li>
            <li>It feels so much fresher than a regular shave.</li>
            <li>really* picky, sometimes the blade&#x27;s edge doesn&#x27;t sit perfectly parallel to the shave arm.  </li>
            <li>your hand is that sensitive to the difference.  </li>
            <li>Package didn&#x27;t come with straight razor, only the 100 blades.</li>
            <li>I had bought an old razor at the flea market and needed blades</li>
            <li>I have had no problems with the blades so far.</li>
            <li>Did my first shave with it today, no nicks or cuts, no redness or razor burn, and it was the closest single pass shave I&#x27;ve ever done.</li>
            <li>these particular razors leave my face red</li>
            <li>B0032QAOPA 100 Derby Professional Single Edge Razor Blades &amp; 1 Straight Razor]]</li>
            <li>While I could have easily paid $15 for a basic razor not including any accessories, this setup was less than $5!</li>
            <li>I have a few areas that have always been a problem for me to get as close a shave as i would like and with this product I was able to actually make my entire face \\&quot;baby bottom smooth\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>not much to say except this thing works exactly how it should.&lt;br /&gt;one</li>
            <li>The blades are sharp, but the straight razor you can tell is a little cheap.</li>
            <li>Next time I will go with the new way.</li>
            <li>My only issue is of technique, not product - I always cut myself with the corners of a new blade</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy a cheap one you can sharpen this is a much better starting point and with all the blades you have awhile to save money on expensive (my personal ones are mach 3 disposable blades)and invest in the last razor you will ever have to buy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not enough to be gross and not a big deal, especially considering the price of the kit, and the fact that you can use fresh blades any time you like.&lt;br /&gt;2.)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Learning with this set up, I came to appreciate that straight razor shaving is not for the faint of heart, requiring more time and careful attention to preparation and technique than I would have been willing to give earlier in my life.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still new to this and don&#x27;t know much, but these blades are head and shoulders above the other 2 blades I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>, wow, it has a rivet where the Diane handle broke, so I can&#x27;t imagine the same issue occurring.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;ll last a year, you&#x27;ll know if straight razors are for you, and IMO, the replaceable blades means there&#x27;s one less thing to go wrong while learning good shaving technique.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it only took about two extra minuets of my time that I am quickly dwindling down with each shave.</li>
            <li>While I do have a straight razor, it&#x27;s a little too sharp for my unpracticed hands right now.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sick of the price gouging from Gillette although it is a great shave</li>
            <li>I do enjoy the convenience of a single vice double edge (that is, I do not need to break the DE in half to put in the shavette).</li>
            <li>Decent, long lasting blades for a shavette.</li>
            <li>There is a problem with it holding the blade tightly, but if you slide it back in carefully and use some folded up waxed paper from the blade, you can push it back into the proper position once loaded and it seems to be fine.</li>
            <li>What I received was 100 Derby single edge razor blades and a Luxor Pro professional barber shaver.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this really matters, because it&#x27;s only ever so slightly, and it&#x27;s not like</li>
            <li>I cut myself pretty good a few times, the blades are crazy sharp, but that was my fault - one second of inattention</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> I am very happy with the razors as the price of it is the cheapest around.</li>
            <li> Got this package in the mail, wrapped in a plastic envelope/bag in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Again excellent value.</li>
            <li> In that sense it is perfect.  </li>
            <li> : the handle that comes in this package is absolutely superb!</li>
            <li> great product!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting great shaves!</li>
            <li> The razor blades are very good quality, which I had hoped for given Derby appeared to be a &amp;#34;known&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> But, it was a very good started razor.</li>
            <li> Great product and wonderful seller.</li>
            <li> Excellent product does it job and the price is great.</li>
            <li> A good find!</li>
            <li> I bought the Dovo Shavette razor and it works great.</li>
            <li> Great value.</li>
            <li> Great razors.</li>
            <li> but once it&#x27;s in, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Have not used, great price</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I will buy them again.</li>
            <li> you can shave with derby blades and also want to try a shavette, then this is a great deal.</li>
            <li> Great buy.</li>
            <li> This is a great bargain.</li>
            <li> shave after shave...very happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> it is a great buy</li>
            <li> He loves it, says it works great.</li>
            <li> The experience was great</li>
            <li> Great for the money.</li>
            <li> Great saver of time and money, and</li>
            <li> Razor was very nice even being very cheap, but still an awesome product.</li>
            <li> I use Derby blades in my Safety DE razor and love them, so I suspect that the Derby blades in this package are excellent.</li>
            <li> but it does work good.</li>
            <li> The accompanying razor is quite good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll find a good razor to replace this one.</li>
            <li> I came across this deal and figured it was too good to pass up.</li>
            <li> No, the blades are great and the razor is as described and effective.</li>
            <li> but i rate the blades as good quality.</li>
            <li> though I could do is get a good shave</li>
            <li> and I thought it would be a good tool to trim my beard lines.  </li>
            <li> no so good</li>
            <li> but it works good.</li>
            <li> i did not see a defect it is good for home use.</li>
            <li> Good price for what you get.</li>
            <li> Will be finding a good home for the blades tho.</li>
            <li> As I said before I do recommend Shark but that is just for my skin, best to try different blades and find what suits you best.</li>
            <li> The first use of the razor did not go perfect but that was not</li>
            <li> Nice beginners razor.</li>
            <li> With these Derby blades there is no need for that kind of nonsense.  </li>
            <li> Of course that title is my own opinion of this product.</li>
            <li> I liked it, i would recommend practicing without the blade</li>
            <li> Most times I shave WTG once and call it a day - which feels great and is 100x better than an electric shave.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of plastic, but everything holds together nicely.</li>
            <li> but i think if you want to see if you want to use a straight razor to shave with this will do the trick perfectly for money you spend i love the idea of the changeable blades and it comes with 100 of them</li>
            <li> works good, it&#x27;s lightweight so to me it fills easy to control.</li>
            <li> and it is very easy to handle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good for practicing and learning the ins and outs of straight razor shaving.</li>
            <li> Cheap and good</li>
            <li> Great shiping and gets the job done right its worth what you pay for, great for edge ups and mustache lining</li>
            <li> great blades that fit easily into my razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I will get better the more I prctice too!</li>
            <li> So, this is a great value for a beginning straight shaver!</li>
            <li> When I saw the price, I thought it might be too good to be true, I was right.&lt;br /&gt;Remember</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, but the handle is very light and flimsy feeling.  </li>
            <li> it has great tutorials on straight edge shaving.</li>
            <li> There is a better blades</li>
            <li> probably one of the more sturdy plastic shavers you can buy.</li>
            <li> that you&#x27;re probably going to be using this on your face or hairline, take the time to invest in something better.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> and he said he likes it more.</li>
            <li> it may look flimsy when you take it out of the package, but it holds a blade very well, and works great.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> 100 blades and a free bonus razor!</li>
            <li> you will undoubtedly find yourself enjoying a nice, cheap, manly shave.</li>
            <li> This shaves so much better than the electric</li>
            <li> given he never used on before I though better to start with this and move up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of those things that you have to man up to get better at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it would have been better if they had forgotten it.</li>
            <li> All in all, it makes a great introduction to straight shaving.</li>
            <li> I bought these after reading some reviews and was glad I did.</li>
            <li> Great product I used it a couple time its great you pretty much pay for what you get a great razor but isnt very sturdy where you place the blade over a good razor also fast shiped</li>
            <li> nice clean shave</li>
            <li> I think for my first Straight Edge razor this was the best to get.</li>
            <li> This razor came fast and was easy to use and worked great.</li>
            <li> Even with me not using correct lather it still shaved pretty good.</li>
            <li> Package came quickly and the product is an amazing value for the price.</li>
            <li> The blades are definitely not the best I&#x27;ve used, but they&#x27;re cheap.  </li>
            <li> Clean cut!</li>
            <li> OKAY cause the product is soo cheap.</li>
            <li> Also good to introduce friends to straight razor because you can change blades.</li>
            <li> People say the straight razor is flimsy, I think its fairly sturdy.</li>
            <li> The razor is easy to use and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> its easy to use for maintaining beard and side burn.</li>
            <li> they are easy to install into my shavette and seem to never run out.</li>
            <li> the blades were easy to install and the razor was easy to use.</li>
            <li> The blades are not sharp at all, when I got them I thought it was a great deal as I tried them</li>
            <li> My first shave was amazing, but then I saw some blades that came with the razor in a side pouch of the case.  </li>
            <li> I have used this set up to learn the art of straight razor shaving, and I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> All in all, it&#x27;s an inexpensive shavette and pretty darned effective.</li>
            <li> The razor gave me a good clean shave and for a first time user of a straight razor of any kind I didn&#x27;t wound myself or suffer and razor burns</li>
            <li> bought these blades on line because i needed them to help clean my smooth top stove--which wears out blades</li>
            <li> the others are fine..</li>
            <li> ALL IS FINE.</li>
            <li> I got this at a great price for my first straight razor.</li>
            <li> but this works fine.</li>
            <li> i really like this alot its kind of cheap filling when your holding it because its so light</li>
            <li> Included was a straight nice strait razor.</li>
            <li> I liked that it came with a straight razor.</li>
            <li> The shaver handle/body is plastic and maybe aluminum (?), and is quite light.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s SO smooth.  </li>
            <li> Because it was so cheap, I was expecting it to be just a cheap knock off with some blades.</li>
            <li> I got my razor for free for buying the blades.</li>
            <li> Sharp and a very good deal.</li>
            <li> In short, it works very nicely.</li>
            <li> It was my husband&#x27;s first straight blade and he loved it</li>
            <li> These blades are as good as any and better fitting than those that have to be snapped in half.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say for sure since this is the first SR I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> The handle is very light, but since it&#x27;s a freebie with the blades, I can&#x27;t really complain,</li>
            <li> However when I am using it (mostly) right I still get pretty rough razor burn and at best I get a shave that is as close as my DE.  </li>
            <li> BUT, it held the blade securely and I was able to get a decent shave - knicks and cuts on face - u bet, but that was not the razor&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li> They work great and if you find that you don&#x27;t like using a straight razor you have not spent alot of money.</li>
            <li> Would love to have a 100.00 straight razor</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s less than $10 for a razor and 100 good blades, what more do you want?  </li>
            <li> It works perfectly, but I wouldn&#x27;t anticipate it lasting too long, but for the cost, it&#x27;s a fantastic value.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty flimsy, but it works just fine.  </li>
            <li> If you want to get into straight razor shaving but feel intimated by the cost, this is a great low cost solution.</li>
            <li> That quickly changed.</li>
            <li> These came really quick.</li>
            <li> But be VERY careful, as manufactured blades, even the milder ones, will cut you up nicely if you don&#x27;t have a very light touch and no pressure at all.</li>
            <li> The shavette is working great until I get the technique down.  </li>
            <li> but I still felt the urge to try it out, and I was pretty surprised how good the bonus straight razor worked.</li>
            <li> a straight razor shave a try, this is a fine product.</li>
            <li> When I am brave again and this little nick is healed I will have another go at it.</li>
            <li> Whilst it took a bit of thinking to figure out how it worked, as no instructions were provided, the sliding blade receptacle holds the blade quite securely and provides an exceedingly functional beginner&#x27;s straight blade shaving device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Already I enjoy the routine and meditation, not to mention the closeness, of shaving with a straight.</li>
            <li> The blade holder is simple but effective.</li>
            <li> for the price its worth it.</li>
            <li> but id say worth the value</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t worth messing with- throw it away.  </li>
            <li> Of course, a lot of people hold up True straight razors as the one true way toshave and may not like a shavette.</li>
            <li> Buy this its soooo worth the money.</li>
            <li> have to find a brand that is just right for ur own skin not the fault of the razor they should make a sample pack with 10 of each different blades</li>
            <li> Other wise amazing product for the low price.</li>
            <li> ThDerby Professional blades deliver a smooth clean shave...</li>
            <li> are sharp and seem to maintain their edge for a good bit of time.</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp really good all around.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> on top just not sharp at all</li>
            <li> The razor that came with the blades was actually of a better quality than another I purchased at the same time thinking if this was almost free the next would be better.</li>
            <li> But actually, it is exactly what was described and what it is monetarily worth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a DE razor user for about 6 months now and in my Tech, which is a rather mild shaver, I absolutely despise Derby blades.</li>
            <li> I bought a better razor from a shop near me and it works very well, spend the money for the quality.</li>
            <li> the only thing i dont like is how easy the blade holder slides out  but other than that its good</li>
            <li> Derby&#x27;s are my second favorite safety razor blade.</li>
            <li> The first razor blade cut me all over..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve evr used</li>
            <li> Also, maybe watch a youtube video or two first.</li>
            <li> the first two shaves.</li>
            <li> how I got myself the first time)</li>
            <li> The razor shaver fell apart after I used it the first time.</li>
            <li> i was only able to make one pass with this thing before I tossed the handle in the bin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my first box of Derby blades for a while now, and it gives me a feeling of never running out of blades again.</li>
            <li> It has a much better feel in my hand compared to the Parker Stainless Steel straight razor (which is only barely metal and mostly plastic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they are nice and sharp and take care of business :0</li>
            <li> I know that i shaved with it for the first time today had been interested in try to learn to shave with a straight razor for some time just didn&#x27;t want to spend alot of cash to try it.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a straight razor.</li>
            <li> Using a straight razor for the first time, I was a bit nervous.</li>
            <li> Once you get past the learning curve, shaving actually becomes pretty enjoyable, and I have yet to have any problem with this product (that wasn&#x27;t my own fault).</li>
            <li> i love to shave with a single razor, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Can use each blade more than once, also is very sharp, well worth the money.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I had previously gotten him one from an Art of Shaving store at the mall and didn&#x27;t like how it didn&#x27;t sound like it was shaving, you know, that scraping sound?</li>
            <li> The light weight + the extra grab of the blade if you choose to shave against the grain of your beard makes it easy for the blade to &amp;#34;hop&amp;#34; against your face, which will leave your skin irritated and red.  </li>
            <li> Even if I didn&#x27;t end up loving it, I can find little to complain about at this price point.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little shavette style of razor that I&#x27;m getting started with in the world of straight shaving.</li>
            <li> The razor, while a little on the cheap side (plastic handle and sheet metal blade holder, you get what you pay for), stayed at the angle I put it which is the important thing.</li>
            <li> The only thing I really dislike is that when a blade is in the razor the corner is exposed, and if your not careful its very easy to cut yourself with that corner.</li>
            <li> So for under $6.00 I thought I would try a shavette straight razor</li>
            <li> It took a minute to figure out that the longer pips on each end of the blade holder need to stick out enough for the blade to go under so it is held securely.</li>
            <li> I just started using a straight razor and bought these blades to try out.  </li>
            <li> Gave them a try and reconsidered the whole straight razor \\&quot;thing\\&quot; until I put another Derby blade in.  </li>
            <li> Straight shaving takes practice, check out youtube</li>
            <li> this makes me want to really learn how strop a real quality razor</li>
            <li> If you are trying to decide if you want to start using a straight razor dont put out a ton of money.</li>
            <li> Thanks Again</li>
            <li> I purchased these for use in my Parker straight razor which accepts &amp;</li>
            <li> On something as aggressive as a shavette though, it&#x27;s an absolute boon.</li>
            <li> I like this straight razor.</li>
            <li> This absolutely can not be beat for the price.</li>
            <li> I have never tried a straight razor before</li>
            <li> so fast--</li>
            <li> However if you have never used a straight razor / shavette then you are in for a learning curve.  </li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really complain about the quality/price.</li>
            <li> I bought these when I bought a straight razor.</li>
            <li> Turns out Derby&#x27;s aren&#x27;t really for me, but for this price you can&#x27;t really go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The disposable blades are available at local walmart, drugstore, etc., or you can reorder here.</li>
            <li> Get one if you want to try straight razors.</li>
            <li> Straight razor works like a charm.</li>
            <li> The blades are a no brainer, but with the straight razor this is a must.</li>
            <li> I got the straight razor set today and immediately set out to test it.</li>
            <li> So far the Red Baron blades have not disappointed!</li>
            <li> I use different straight razors for for trimming and shaping,but this little guy is really safe and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> The straight razor is a pretty good item,but the blades are thin and flimsy.  </li>
            <li> The product is certainly cheap: the blades dull easily and I need to change them after every shave.  </li>
            <li> I called the customer service number and the person immediately shipped the right blades, but told me that the Red Baron blades are actually higher end.</li>
            <li> My first shave was done carefully as the only time a straight razor has touched me before was in the hands of my ever so skilled and trusted barber</li>
            <li> It gets me a great shave and this quantity should last me a couple of years....except I am still trying other blades out at the same time.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something to test the waters of straight shaving before spending a ridiculous amount of money on a actual blade, this is a great place to start.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I never have to break blades in half again.</li>
            <li> Much better than the sharks that I was previously using.</li>
            <li> I wanted to make sure that I could get used to straight shaving without destroying my skin, and it works just as well as I thought.</li>
            <li> Most people don&#x27;t use a straight Blade and they are missing out.</li>
            <li> After a couple of shaves I now have the hang of using this particular razor.</li>
            <li> the blades are nice no more braking in half and then losing the other half fit nice in my holder the free holder that comes with</li>
            <li> Buy this kit and give it a try before you buy a high end razor.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> the blades are sharp and smooth, but the handle as so much &amp;#34;wiggle room&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I decided to use a shavette like this, with replaceable blades, since I was just getting started with straight shaving and didn&#x27;t want to complicate matters with maintaining a sharp edge on a true straight razor.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little more time to shave, yes,</li>
            <li> so i never have to wait until its dull to change them out its kind of tricky sliding the blade into the holder</li>
            <li> In fact it may be a great kit for use year after year, there&#x27;s nothing really wrong with it.  </li>
            <li> , I am interested in purchasing a heavier handle or possibly a vintage straight blade.</li>
            <li> This is a low quality razor, suited to someone who knows exactly how to use a straight razor, not someone new to it.  </li>
            <li> No work to maintain blade, just change to a new one.</li>
            <li> So many in the box for so little money!</li>
            <li> Blades gave a very good shave, but might have a little trouble on longer facial hair.</li>
            <li> Though it is, as some describe, a light and cheap feeling razor I found nothing wrong with it and what can one really expect for the price.</li>
            <li> I decided to try straightrazor shaving, and this seemed a better idea than spending the required amount for an actual shaving quality razor to find out if I could do it without cutting my own throat.</li>
            <li> I managed to cut my facial hair pretty well after I got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> In most cases I can&#x27;t snap a normal DE blade to a half prettily enough to get it stucked to a shavette without separate blade holder.</li>
            <li> Now I can use both my old shavette without blade holder and a new one I got with my pack of Derbys.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shavette might rust if you leave it in a high humidity environment and dont wipe it off after use, but other than that is should work fine, especially for the low low price of pretty much free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only issue I have had is with my use of them, I&#x27;m new to using a straight blade to shave, and my face looks like I got into a fight with a cat on steroids...</li>
            <li> In the picture it was a white razor i received a black one which was even better.</li>
            <li> The holder slides out of the razor and reveals a little notched area for the blades to fit into.</li>
            <li> Just use a knife blade to pry them open a little more.</li>
            <li> Super sharp and the box contains a ton of them.</li>
            <li> Razors are super duper sharp.</li>
            <li> Straight razor shaving takes some practice butonce there, you&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
            <li> This combination of glasses and holder was the lowest price I could find anywhere by a considerable amount.</li>
            <li> I have been using a double edge (saftey razor) for a while and decided to dip my toe into the straight razor pool by trying out this inexpensive</li>
            <li> blade lasted ~3 months of frequent use so in about 300 months</li>
            <li> It feels so much fresher than a regular shave.</li>
            <li> really* picky, sometimes the blade&#x27;s edge doesn&#x27;t sit perfectly parallel to the shave arm.  </li>
            <li> your hand is that sensitive to the difference.  </li>
            <li> Package didn&#x27;t come with straight razor, only the 100 blades.</li>
            <li> I had bought an old razor at the flea market and needed blades</li>
            <li> I have had no problems with the blades so far.</li>
            <li> Did my first shave with it today, no nicks or cuts, no redness or razor burn, and it was the closest single pass shave I&#x27;ve ever done.</li>
            <li> these particular razors leave my face red</li>
            <li> B0032QAOPA 100 Derby Professional Single Edge Razor Blades &amp; 1 Straight Razor]]</li>
            <li> While I could have easily paid $15 for a basic razor not including any accessories, this setup was less than $5!</li>
            <li> I have a few areas that have always been a problem for me to get as close a shave as i would like and with this product I was able to actually make my entire face \\&quot;baby bottom smooth\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> not much to say except this thing works exactly how it should.&lt;br /&gt;one</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp, but the straight razor you can tell is a little cheap.</li>
            <li> Next time I will go with the new way.</li>
            <li> My only issue is of technique, not product - I always cut myself with the corners of a new blade</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy a cheap one you can sharpen this is a much better starting point and with all the blades you have awhile to save money on expensive (my personal ones are mach 3 disposable blades)and invest in the last razor you will ever have to buy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not enough to be gross and not a big deal, especially considering the price of the kit, and the fact that you can use fresh blades any time you like.&lt;br /&gt;2.)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Learning with this set up, I came to appreciate that straight razor shaving is not for the faint of heart, requiring more time and careful attention to preparation and technique than I would have been willing to give earlier in my life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still new to this and don&#x27;t know much, but these blades are head and shoulders above the other 2 blades I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> , wow, it has a rivet where the Diane handle broke, so I can&#x27;t imagine the same issue occurring.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;ll last a year, you&#x27;ll know if straight razors are for you, and IMO, the replaceable blades means there&#x27;s one less thing to go wrong while learning good shaving technique.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it only took about two extra minuets of my time that I am quickly dwindling down with each shave.</li>
            <li> While I do have a straight razor, it&#x27;s a little too sharp for my unpracticed hands right now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sick of the price gouging from Gillette although it is a great shave</li>
            <li> I do enjoy the convenience of a single vice double edge (that is, I do not need to break the DE in half to put in the shavette).</li>
            <li> Decent, long lasting blades for a shavette.</li>
            <li> There is a problem with it holding the blade tightly, but if you slide it back in carefully and use some folded up waxed paper from the blade, you can push it back into the proper position once loaded and it seems to be fine.</li>
            <li> What I received was 100 Derby single edge razor blades and a Luxor Pro professional barber shaver.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this really matters, because it&#x27;s only ever so slightly, and it&#x27;s not like</li>
            <li> I cut myself pretty good a few times, the blades are crazy sharp, but that was my fault - one second of inattention</li>
            <li> that even a fairly slow pass ends up with a great amount of drag leading to a lousy shave at best and blood at worst.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see it lasting long enough for 100 blades.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend this product to any one looking to get started or just to save a few dollars where they can.</li>
            <li> I have used straight razors in the past and need warn you about using this razor.</li>
            <li> I had no problems getting the blade in the push-out holder, and as long as you keep the blade pointing up and tilted back</li>
            <li> For less than the price of a footlong Cold Cut Combo, you can find out if you actually enjoy shaving with a straight razor!</li>
            <li> these Turkish made Derby blades have just the right &amp;#34;sharpness.&amp;#34;  Japanese made Feather blades are so sharp (some say &amp;#34;ninja&amp;#34; sharp) that some guys actually run them through a cork a couple of times to make them less sharp.  </li>
            <li> In fact the blades are SO sharp that I can barely even feel it when I do cut myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> blades- but for the value, I can&#x27;t see going wrong with this product, even if the shaver is cheap.</li>
            <li> and they stay that way for a long time...</li>
            <li> Only downside is that their nowhere as sharp as the shark blades.</li>
            <li> The blades are verry sharp and the shaver is bit low budget</li>
            <li> It is solid when locked into place and has no wiggle as the other did.</li>
            <li> I know they are cheap but at least it should work hard to place on the carrier and</li>
            <li> once you get used to the danger of the single blade.  </li>
            <li> I shave everyday with only one blade half in my safety razor and still haven&#x27;t finished this little box of razors a whole year and a half later.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s silly, yes, but true.</li>
            <li> it a try but be careful</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t expect to drag race a car that was just purchased for $200 it would be a miracle to get it home.</li>
            <li> False title as it should have came with 1 straight razor</li>
            <li> I find that these blades are not as sharp and tend to drag on my skin.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t even load my first blade before the cheap-o razor fell apart.</li>
            <li> razor sharp</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even attempt a shave with the other razor after I inspected it upon arrival.</li>
            <li> Sharp...</li>
            <li> Due to how the blades are held, if you want to get *</li>
            <li> So use lots of shaving cream/soap and be very careful.</li>
            <li> The slide in the razor is a little loose and it can be a bit fiddly getting the blade to sit</li>
            <li> Just be careful second time he used it he cut himself pretty badly.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not economical.</li>
            <li> unfortunately for me i cut out all of my hair follicles before i had the chance to really learn how to use it well.</li>
            <li> As for the blades I don&#x27;t really see anything wrong with them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to thoroughly dry it due to the sharp blade and holding mechanism, so after about a month of use, I have some slight rust.  </li>
            <li> , it is sharp!</li>
            <li> but the razors are very sharp.....</li>
            <li> Very sharp, and cuts whiskers like they are butter.</li>
            <li> and they are very sharp.</li>
            <li> Changing the blades should be a simple enough process, but I still feel that the design is very poor quality.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I can tell you that the Razor itself is plastic with thin metal that refuses to hold the blade properly.  </li>
            <li> Usually, that is a negative title, but frankly, I had low expectations for the product.  </li>
            <li> a little before you start, get a feel for it.</li>
            <li> slide out piece with a few knobs and hooks that hold the blade into place.</li>
            <li> The few complaints I have are:&lt;br /&gt;1.)</li>
            <li> The underside of the replaceable blades can leave a film of rust spots on the shaver arm if they aren&#x27;t dried after use.  </li>
            <li> My brother used these blades and cut himself pretty badly, he has been using a shavette for around a year.</li>
            <li> I rate this as a  three due to the fact the razor is a little on the poorly made side, razor is to lite</li>
            <li> Maybe with a heavier shaver this wouldn&#x27;t be a problem, I&#x27;m not sure.  </li>
            <li> And, when you combine it with shaving soap and a brush, it&#x27;s like a blast from the past.</li>
            <li> It also came with three small packets of hair gel that I&#x27;ll never use because I don&#x27;t use hair gel.</li>
            <li> Blades are already cut in half making the dangerous process of trying to snap a double edged blade unnecessary.</li>
            <li> The blades angle and flexalbily may be hard to get used to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too hard to avoid this though, and a lot of people choose not to shave against the grain.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still learning and cut myself a little now and then, but that&#x27;s not uncommon.</li>
            <li> : If you have delicate skin you should find something else to shave with.</li>
            <li> No more multi blades for this guy!</li>
            <li> almost impossible to load blade onto razor, blades dont insert properly</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t send the product back, although I am slightly disappointed that I didn&#x27;t get what I ordered.  </li>
            <li> The razor that comes with these blades is not great.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is morons out there want to make it complicated!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed by the shaver-</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> You cant go wrong for just a couple bucks though.  </li>
            <li> Not the sharpest I have tried, but it by no means uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with this if you&#x27;re just getting started with shaving, it&#x27;s like a Honda Civic.  </li>
            <li> Plastic handle, and very thin metal blade holder.  </li>
            <li> Without trying another razor it would be impossible to tell how others would compare, and it&#x27;s not a reason not to get this</li>
            <li> If you can pull off an ATG pass you will be rubbing your face like an idiot all day b/c</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Derby&#x27;s are my second favorite safety razor blade. So for under $6.00 I thought I would try a shavette straight razor and if I didn&#x27;t like it, nothing would be lost. It took a minute to figure out that the longer pips on each end of the blade holder need to stick out enough for the blade to go under so it is held securely. Just use a knife blade to pry them open a little more. The first use of the razor did not go perfect but that was not it&#x27;s fault. When I am brave again and this little nick is healed I will have another go at it.</li>
            <li> I just started using a straight razor and bought these blades to try out.  My first shave was amazing, but then I saw some blades that came with the razor in a side pouch of the case.  Gave them a try and reconsidered the whole straight razor \\&quot;thing\\&quot; until I put another Derby blade in.  I&#x27;m still new to this and don&#x27;t know much, but these blades are head and shoulders above the other 2 blades I&#x27;ve tried.  The razor that comes with these blades is not great.  It gets the job done, but the handle is very light and flimsy feeling.  But it&#x27;s less than $10 for a razor and 100 good blades, what more do you want?  I bought the Dovo Shavette razor and it works great.</li>
            <li> Great value. I shave everyday with only one blade half in my safety razor and still haven&#x27;t finished this little box of razors a whole year and a half later. Only downside is that their nowhere as sharp as the shark blades.</li>
            <li> Nice beginners razor. The blades are verry sharp and the shaver is bit low budget but it does work good. Straight shaving takes practice, check out youtube it has great tutorials on straight edge shaving.</li>
            <li> I remember putting in an order on Amazon for 100 Derby double edge razors.  What I received was 100 Derby single edge razor blades and a Luxor Pro professional barber shaver.  I can&#x27;t attest to the quality of the derby blades yet.  I won&#x27;t send the product back, although I am slightly disappointed that I didn&#x27;t get what I ordered.  I&#x27;m not impressed by the shaver- it has a very low quality design.  Plastic handle, and very thin metal blade holder.  Changing the blades should be a simple enough process, but I still feel that the design is very poor quality. My rating has nothing to do with the quality of Derby blades- but for the value, I can&#x27;t see going wrong with this product, even if the shaver is cheap.</li>
            <li> The first razor blade cut me all over.. the others are fine.. maybe it was a 1 blade thing. Quite relaxing. The accompanying razor is quite good.</li>
            <li> i really like this alot its kind of cheap filling when your holding it because its so light but i think if you want to see if you want to use a straight razor to shave with this will do the trick perfectly for money you spend i love the idea of the changeable blades and it comes with 100 of them so i never have to wait until its dull to change them out its kind of tricky sliding the blade into the holder but you will get the hang of it this makes me want to really learn how strop a real quality razor this thing answered my question</li>
            <li> If you are trying to decide if you want to start using a straight razor dont put out a ton of money. Buy this kit and give it a try before you buy a high end razor. I know that i shaved with it for the first time today had been interested in try to learn to shave with a straight razor for some time just didn&#x27;t want to spend alot of cash to try it. Don&#x27;t buy a cheap one you can sharpen this is a much better starting point and with all the blades you have awhile to save money on expensive (my personal ones are mach 3 disposable blades)and invest in the last razor you will ever have to buy. Thanks Again</li>
            <li> nice clean shave once you get used to the danger of the single blade.  The blades angle and flexalbily may be hard to get used to.</li>
            <li> Decent, long lasting blades for a shavette. In most cases I can&#x27;t snap a normal DE blade to a half prettily enough to get it stucked to a shavette without separate blade holder. Now I can use both my old shavette without blade holder and a new one I got with my pack of Derbys.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the razors as the price of it is the cheapest around. The blades are sharp, but the straight razor you can tell is a little cheap. BUT thats OKAY cause the product is soo cheap. definitely give this product a GO</li>
            <li> Can use each blade more than once, also is very sharp, well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Clean cut! My barber use&#x27;s this stuff swell</li>
            <li> I use Derby blades in my Safety DE razor and love them, so I suspect that the Derby blades in this package are excellent. Unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t even load my first blade before the cheap-o razor fell apart. I&#x27;ll find a good razor to replace this one.</li>
            <li> ITEM AS ADVERTISED. ALL IS FINE.</li>
            <li> There is a better blades</li>
            <li> If you want to get into straight razor shaving but feel intimated by the cost, this is a great low cost solution. The shaver itself is plastic but probably one of the more sturdy plastic shavers you can buy. It has a much better feel in my hand compared to the Parker Stainless Steel straight razor (which is only barely metal and mostly plastic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try but be careful, it is sharp!</li>
            <li> Got this package in the mail, wrapped in a plastic envelope/bag in perfect condition. I wanted to make sure that I could get used to straight shaving without destroying my skin, and it works just as well as I thought. The shavette itself isn&#x27;t much, a simple slide in/ slide out piece with a few knobs and hooks that hold the blade into place. It works perfectly, but I wouldn&#x27;t anticipate it lasting too long, but for the cost, it&#x27;s a fantastic value. Once you get past the learning curve, shaving actually becomes pretty enjoyable, and I have yet to have any problem with this product (that wasn&#x27;t my own fault). I would have paid the same price for the blades alone, but the blades/shavette combo is a steal. If you&#x27;re looking for something to test the waters of straight shaving before spending a ridiculous amount of money on a actual blade, this is a great place to start.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for use in my Parker straight razor which accepts &amp;#34;half blades.&amp;#34;  For me these Turkish made Derby blades have just the right &amp;#34;sharpness.&amp;#34;  Japanese made Feather blades are so sharp (some say &amp;#34;ninja&amp;#34; sharp) that some guys actually run them through a cork a couple of times to make them less sharp.  With these Derby blades there is no need for that kind of nonsense.  Just put them in the razor and shave.  An instructor once told me &amp;#34;Life is actually a fairly simple process.  The only problem is morons out there want to make it complicated!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> i love to shave with a single razor, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. but the razors are very sharp..... razor sharp you could say. so be carefull</li>
            <li> Great product and wonderful seller.</li>
            <li> I came across this deal and figured it was too good to pass up. I&#x27;m sick of the price gouging from Gillette although it is a great shave it&#x27;s not economical. That and I do have a bit of a knack for nostalgia. The razor that came with the blades was actually of a better quality than another I purchased at the same time thinking if this was almost free the next would be better. I was wrong. Though it is, as some describe, a light and cheap feeling razor I found nothing wrong with it and what can one really expect for the price. I wouldn&#x27;t expect to drag race a car that was just purchased for $200 it would be a miracle to get it home. No, the blades are great and the razor is as described and effective. It is solid when locked into place and has no wiggle as the other did. I didn&#x27;t even attempt a shave with the other razor after I inspected it upon arrival. The razor gave me a good clean shave and for a first time user of a straight razor of any kind I didn&#x27;t wound myself or suffer and razor burns and I highly recommend this product to any one looking to get started or just to save a few dollars where they can. No more multi blades for this guy! I have a few areas that have always been a problem for me to get as close a shave as i would like and with this product I was able to actually make my entire face \\&quot;baby bottom smooth\\&quot;. My first shave was done carefully as the only time a straight razor has touched me before was in the hands of my ever so skilled and trusted barber but it only took about two extra minuets of my time that I am quickly dwindling down with each shave. It&#x27;s all a progressive step to upgrading to \\&quot;The Last Razor\\&quot; I will ever buy.</li>
            <li> Of course that title is my own opinion of this product. I find that these blades are not as sharp and tend to drag on my skin. My brother used these blades and cut himself pretty badly, he has been using a shavette for around a year. As I said before I do recommend Shark but that is just for my skin, best to try different blades and find what suits you best.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little shavette style of razor that I&#x27;m getting started with in the world of straight shaving. I&#x27;ve been a DE razor user for about 6 months now and in my Tech, which is a rather mild shaver, I absolutely despise Derby blades. On something as aggressive as a shavette though, it&#x27;s an absolute boon. The holder slides out of the razor and reveals a little notched area for the blades to fit into. There is a problem with it holding the blade tightly, but if you slide it back in carefully and use some folded up waxed paper from the blade, you can push it back into the proper position once loaded and it seems to be fine. Very sharp, and cuts whiskers like they are butter. But be VERY careful, as manufactured blades, even the milder ones, will cut you up nicely if you don&#x27;t have a very light touch and no pressure at all. All in all, it&#x27;s an inexpensive shavette and pretty darned effective.</li>
            <li> Usually, that is a negative title, but frankly, I had low expectations for the product.  But actually, it is exactly what was described and what it is monetarily worth. The handle is lightweight and plastic, the blade holder seems flimsy BUT, it held the blade securely and I was able to get a decent shave - knicks and cuts on face - u bet, but that was not the razor&#x27;s fault. If what you want to do is give a straight razor shave a try, this is a fine product. I don&#x27;t see it lasting long enough for 100 blades.</li>
            <li> Great razors. It was my husband&#x27;s first straight blade and he loved it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind Derby blades at all.  As for the razor it&#x27;s pretty flimsy, but it works just fine.  You cant go wrong for just a couple bucks though.  The only thing I really dislike is that when a blade is in the razor the corner is exposed, and if your not careful its very easy to cut yourself with that corner.</li>
            <li> Great shiping and gets the job done right its worth what you pay for, great for edge ups and mustache lining</li>
            <li> The razor is easy to use and gets the job done. Well I use it for cleaning up my shape ups on all my clients. If you looking at these get is all I can see.</li>
            <li> great blades that fit easily into my razor. are sharp and seem to maintain their edge for a good bit of time.</li>
            <li> Straight razor shaving takes some practice butonce there, you&#x27;ll never go back. These blades are as good as any and better fitting than those that have to be snapped in half. The slide in the razor is a little loose and it can be a bit fiddly getting the blade to sit right but once it&#x27;s in, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Package came quickly and the product is an amazing value for the price. Blades are already cut in half making the dangerous process of trying to snap a double edged blade unnecessary. Included was a straight nice strait razor. Again excellent value.</li>
            <li> I have used this set up to learn the art of straight razor shaving, and I am very pleased with my purchase. This combination of glasses and holder was the lowest price I could find anywhere by a considerable amount. The razor blades are very good quality, which I had hoped for given Derby appeared to be a &amp;#34;known&amp;#34; brand. I do enjoy the convenience of a single vice double edge (that is, I do not need to break the DE in half to put in the shavette). The blade holder is simple but effective. Whilst it took a bit of thinking to figure out how it worked, as no instructions were provided, the sliding blade receptacle holds the blade quite securely and provides an exceedingly functional beginner&#x27;s straight blade shaving device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learning with this set up, I came to appreciate that straight razor shaving is not for the faint of heart, requiring more time and careful attention to preparation and technique than I would have been willing to give earlier in my life. Having now mastered the basics of shaving, no longer looking like I have wandered through a briar patch each morning, I am interested in purchasing a heavier handle or possibly a vintage straight blade.</li>
            <li> I like this straight razor. It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve evr used and it is very easy to handle. I&#x27;m sure I will get better the more I prctice too! 100 razors should last me a while so it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> When I saw the price, I thought it might be too good to be true, I was right.&lt;br /&gt;Remember that you&#x27;re probably going to be using this on your face or hairline, take the time to invest in something better.</li>
            <li> I rate this as a  three due to the fact the razor is a little on the poorly made side, razor is to lite but i rate the blades as good quality.</li>
            <li> Ive used double edge razors for about 2 years now. Started with a traditional dovo straight razor and did that for a few months. Then I tried this. Did my first shave with it today, no nicks or cuts, no redness or razor burn, and it was the closest single pass shave I&#x27;ve ever done. This absolutely can not be beat for the price.</li>
            <li> For less than the price of a footlong Cold Cut Combo, you can find out if you actually enjoy shaving with a straight razor! While I could have easily paid $15 for a basic razor not including any accessories, this setup was less than $5! Even if I didn&#x27;t end up loving it, I can find little to complain about at this price point.</li>
            <li> works good, it&#x27;s lightweight so to me it fills easy to control. A good find! The blades are sharp really good all around. Thank&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> almost impossible to load blade onto razor, blades dont insert properly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0032QAOPA 100 Derby Professional Single Edge Razor Blades &amp; 1 Straight Razor]]</li>
            <li> I love this product.  unfortunately for me i cut out all of my hair follicles before i had the chance to really learn how to use it well.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s me but the only thing I can do is cut myself.  I though I could do is get a good shave but the only thing I get out of this is my blood.  Next time I will go with the new way.</li>
            <li> i use it for beard n side burns. its easy to use for maintaining beard and side burn. for the price its worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a low quality razor, suited to someone who knows exactly how to use a straight razor, not someone new to it.  I have never tried a straight razor before and I thought it would be a good tool to trim my beard lines.  I am not expert, but it is difficult to hold and is rather flimsy, I cut the heck out of myself even after watching many how-to videos and practicing with it.  Shipped on time.  I bought a better razor from a shop near me and it works very well, spend the money for the quality.</li>
            <li> bought these blades on line because i needed them to help clean my smooth top stove--which wears out blades so fast--</li>
            <li> The product is as advertised, a plastic shavette with 100 blades for it.  In that sense it is perfect.  However if you have never used a straight razor / shavette then you are in for a learning curve.  I have been using a double edge (saftey razor) for a while and decided to dip my toe into the straight razor pool by trying out this inexpensive option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several attempts I haven&#x27;t gotten the hang of it.  I cut myself pretty good a few times, the blades are crazy sharp, but that was my fault - one second of inattention and you pay.  However when I am using it (mostly) right I still get pretty rough razor burn and at best I get a shave that is as close as my DE.  Is this my fault or the device?  I can&#x27;t say for sure since this is the first SR I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Super sharp and the box contains a ton of them. Most people don&#x27;t use a straight Blade and they are missing out. It allows you to shape and edge with precision.</li>
            <li> I got these for my boyfriend. I liked that it came with a straight razor. My boyfriend and I had previously gotten him one from an Art of Shaving store at the mall and didn&#x27;t like how it didn&#x27;t sound like it was shaving, you know, that scraping sound? Well this has it and he said he likes it more. So, this is a great value for a beginning straight shaver!</li>
            <li> When I ordered this, I accidentally got the Red Baron blades, not Derby. I called the customer service number and the person immediately shipped the right blades, but told me that the Red Baron blades are actually higher end. So far the Red Baron blades have not disappointed! The only issue I have had is with my use of them, I&#x27;m new to using a straight blade to shave, and my face looks like I got into a fight with a cat on steroids... not the blades fault at all. In fact the blades are SO sharp that I can barely even feel it when I do cut myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onto the handle: the handle that comes in this package is absolutely superb! I also bought the Diane brand handle and it immediately broke. The MD Barber Supply handle though, wow, it has a rivet where the Diane handle broke, so I can&#x27;t imagine the same issue occurring. it may look flimsy when you take it out of the package, but it holds a blade very well, and works great. I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really complain about the quality/price. I can&#x27;t complain about the price. My baby face is getting about a week per blade. Not the sharpest I have tried, but it by no means uncomfortable. It does not tug at my face. It gets me a great shave and this quantity should last me a couple of years....except I am still trying other blades out at the same time.</li>
            <li> not much to say except this thing works exactly how it should.&lt;br /&gt;one blade lasted ~3 months of frequent use so in about 300 months i should be done with the 100 blades, i hope it doesn&#x27;t rust within the 10 years</li>
            <li> Have not used, great price</li>
            <li> the blades are nice no more braking in half and then losing the other half fit nice in my holder the free holder that comes with it is ... no so good i wouldn&#x27;t use it unless i had to but id say worth the value</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I never have to break blades in half again. The are already broke into and are individually raped. This is a great product and I will buy them again.</li>
            <li> Love it. I bought these when I bought a straight razor. While I admit, I dont use it every day, every once in a while I do, and man there just isnt anything like it. It feels so much fresher than a regular shave. Work the money and effort.</li>
            <li> The blades are not sharp at all, when I got them I thought it was a great deal as I tried them yes I know they are cheap but at least it should work hard to place on the carrier and on top just not sharp at all</li>
            <li> I liked it, i would recommend practicing without the blade a little before you start, get a feel for it. Also, maybe watch a youtube video or two first. Overall, a bargain of a shave.</li>
            <li> these particular razors leave my face red but i use another brand and they cut my face up have to find a brand that is just right for ur own skin not the fault of the razor they should make a sample pack with 10 of each different blades it is trail and error</li>
            <li> Shaving Shack shavette and 100 blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can shave with derby blades and also want to try a shavette, then this is a great deal. Turns out Derby&#x27;s aren&#x27;t really for me, but for this price you can&#x27;t really go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shavette might rust if you leave it in a high humidity environment and dont wipe it off after use, but other than that is should work fine, especially for the low low price of pretty much free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically if you just want to try out a shavette, go for it.</li>
            <li> I got this at a great price for my first straight razor. I used this to learn on and still use it now. No work to maintain blade, just change to a new one. Got 100 disposables blades with razor and they are very sharp. The disposable blades are available at local walmart, drugstore, etc., or you can reorder here. Also good to introduce friends to straight razor because you can change blades. Would love to have a 100.00 straight razor but this works fine. This is not a handcrafted item, its plastic but it works good. Get one if you want to try straight razors. They work great and if you find that you don&#x27;t like using a straight razor you have not spent alot of money. And with refill blades you have something that can be given to a friend to try.</li>
            <li> I decided to try straightrazor shaving, and this seemed a better idea than spending the required amount for an actual shaving quality razor to find out if I could do it without cutting my own throat. My only issue is of technique, not product - I always cut myself with the corners of a new blade the first two shaves. I&#x27;d be happier if they were rounded over and didn&#x27;t have corners. The handle is very light, but since it&#x27;s a freebie with the blades, I can&#x27;t really complain, right?</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a straight razor. I haven&#x27;t yet received my brush but I still felt the urge to try it out, and I was pretty surprised how good the bonus straight razor worked. Even with me not using correct lather it still shaved pretty good. I&#x27;m still learning and cut myself a little now and then, but that&#x27;s not uncommon. As for the blades I don&#x27;t really see anything wrong with them. They are affordable and do what they say. Great buy.</li>
            <li> Using a straight razor for the first time, I was a bit nervous. That quickly changed. This is a great bargain. 100 blades and a free bonus razor! How can I complain? After a couple of passes, I was hooked. After a couple of shaves I now have the hang of using this particular razor. If you can keep from nicking yourself with the corner of the blade,(that&#x27;s how I got myself the first time) you will undoubtedly find yourself enjoying a nice, cheap, manly shave.</li>
            <li> The product is certainly cheap: the blades dull easily and I need to change them after every shave.  But, 100 blades and a razor for 6 bucks???  C&#x27;mon!  You can&#x27;t beat that!  The razor (shavette) works well.  I got this extra to keep at my girlfriend&#x27;s.  While I do have a straight razor, it&#x27;s a little too sharp for my unpracticed hands right now.  The shavette is working great until I get the technique down.  Already I enjoy the routine and meditation, not to mention the closeness, of shaving with a straight.</li>
            <li> these are legit and cause me no problems. they are nice and sharp and take care of business :0 they are easy to install into my shavette and seem to never run out. great product!</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I can tell you that the Razor itself is plastic with thin metal that refuses to hold the blade properly.  It isn&#x27;t worth messing with- throw it away.  The blades are definitely not the best I&#x27;ve used, but they&#x27;re cheap.  So use lots of shaving cream/soap and be very careful.</li>
            <li> Sharp...and they stay that way for a long time...shave after shave...very happy with my purchase.  Delivered promptly.  ThDerby Professional blades deliver a smooth clean shave...just like the barber&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> I decided to use a shavette like this, with replaceable blades, since I was just getting started with straight shaving and didn&#x27;t want to complicate matters with maintaining a sharp edge on a true straight razor.  I shave about 3 times per blade, so the pack-in blades should last about 1 year.  The few complaints I have are:&lt;br /&gt;1.) The underside of the replaceable blades can leave a film of rust spots on the shaver arm if they aren&#x27;t dried after use.  It&#x27;s hard to thoroughly dry it due to the sharp blade and holding mechanism, so after about a month of use, I have some slight rust.  It&#x27;s not enough to be gross and not a big deal, especially considering the price of the kit, and the fact that you can use fresh blades any time you like.&lt;br /&gt;2.) Due to how the blades are held, if you want to get *really* picky, sometimes the blade&#x27;s edge doesn&#x27;t sit perfectly parallel to the shave arm.  I don&#x27;t think this really matters, because it&#x27;s only ever so slightly, and it&#x27;s not like your hand is that sensitive to the difference.  I&#x27;ve never had a problem.&lt;br /&gt;3.) The shaver handle/body is plastic and maybe aluminum (?), and is quite light.  This is not an heirloom - it is a $5 plastic razor.  The light weight + the extra grab of the blade if you choose to shave against the grain of your beard makes it easy for the blade to &amp;#34;hop&amp;#34; against your face, which will leave your skin irritated and red.  It&#x27;s not too hard to avoid this though, and a lot of people choose not to shave against the grain.  Maybe with a heavier shaver this wouldn&#x27;t be a problem, I&#x27;m not sure.  Without trying another razor it would be impossible to tell how others would compare, and it&#x27;s not a reason not to get this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with this if you&#x27;re just getting started with shaving, it&#x27;s like a Honda Civic.  In fact it may be a great kit for use year after year, there&#x27;s nothing really wrong with it.  Of course, a lot of people hold up True straight razors as the one true way toshave and may not like a shavette. For $6 I say try this out, it&#x27;ll last a year, you&#x27;ll know if straight razors are for you, and IMO, the replaceable blades means there&#x27;s one less thing to go wrong while learning good shaving technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m keeping an eye out for a permanent blade razor, but who knows if I&#x27;ll like it - this requires literally no maintenance, and costs $6 a year to shave (+ a brush and lather).  This shaves so much better than the electric I came from that there is literally no comparison, and my face burns about 1/10th compared to disposable blades.  It took about 2 weeks until I could avoid obvious cuts and nicks, though 1-2x a week I still get one.  Most times I shave WTG once and call it a day - which feels great and is 100x better than an electric shave.  If you can pull off an ATG pass you will be rubbing your face like an idiot all day b/c it&#x27;s SO smooth.  It takes a little more time to shave, yes, but oh well!  Go click buy already!</li>
            <li> I was uneasy to buy this because some reviews had said it didnt close properly. Personaly i did not see a defect it is good for home use.</li>
            <li> I use different straight razors for for trimming and shaping,but this little guy is really safe and easy to handle.From mustaches to trimming the neck,you can&#x27;t beat this one,and a afordable price too.</li>
            <li> it is a great buy and  does  exactallllly what it it suppose to do  the only thing i dont like is how easy the blade holder slides out  but other than that its good</li>
            <li> Great product I used it a couple time its great you pretty much pay for what you get a great razor but isnt very sturdy where you place the blade over a good razor also fast shiped</li>
            <li> Razors are super duper sharp. Straight razor works like a charm. Excellent product does it job and the price is great.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my boyfriend. I was looking at ones that were pricy but given he never used on before I though better to start with this and move up. He loves it, says it works great. Just be careful second time he used it he cut himself pretty badly. Other wise amazing product for the low price.</li>
            <li> Because it was so cheap, I was expecting it to be just a cheap knock off with some blades. But, it was a very good started razor. It&#x27;s very good for practicing and learning the ins and outs of straight razor shaving. I use this exclusively for shaving. And, when you combine it with shaving soap and a brush, it&#x27;s like a blast from the past. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> These came really quick. In all honesty I bought it to keep on my shelf for looks. Good price for what you get.</li>
            <li> Package didn&#x27;t come with straight razor, only the 100 blades. False title as it should have came with 1 straight razor</li>
            <li> This is an awesome deal. Razor was very nice even being very cheap, but still an awesome product. In the picture it was a white razor i received a black one which was even better. Buy this its soooo worth the money.</li>
            <li> People say the straight razor is flimsy, I think its fairly sturdy. It&#x27;s made of plastic, but everything holds together nicely. The blades are a no brainer, but with the straight razor this is a must.</li>
            <li> I think for my first Straight Edge razor this was the best to get. The experience was great but it did a number to my skin. I managed to cut my facial hair pretty well after I got the hang of it. It&#x27;s one of those things that you have to man up to get better at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Cheap and good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: If you have delicate skin you should find something else to shave with.</li>
            <li> I got my razor for free for buying the blades. I think it would have been better if they had forgotten it. I had bought an old razor at the flea market and needed blades so I bought the derby blades it was cheaper to buy the one with the razor than without. The razor shaver fell apart after I used it the first time. I have had no problems with the blades so far.</li>
            <li> I got the straight razor set today and immediately set out to test it. In short, it works very nicely. The razor, while a little on the cheap side (plastic handle and sheet metal blade holder, you get what you pay for), stayed at the angle I put it which is the important thing. I had no problems getting the blade in the push-out holder, and as long as you keep the blade pointing up and tilted back you&#x27;ll have no problem getting it in the holder. Blades gave a very good shave, but might have a little trouble on longer facial hair. It also came with three small packets of hair gel that I&#x27;ll never use because I don&#x27;t use hair gel. All in all, it makes a great introduction to straight shaving.</li>
            <li> I bought these after reading some reviews and was glad I did. Much better than the sharks that I was previously using. Sharp and a very good deal.</li>
            <li> The straight razor is a pretty good item,but the blades are thin and flimsy.  Once you figure out how to get the blade to stay in razor it&#x27;s time to change the blade.</li>
            <li> This razor came fast and was easy to use and worked great. the blades were easy to install and the razor was easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have used straight razors in the past and need warn you about using this razor. the blades are sharp and smooth, but the handle as so much &amp;#34;wiggle room&amp;#34; that even a fairly slow pass ends up with a great amount of drag leading to a lousy shave at best and blood at worst. i was only able to make one pass with this thing before I tossed the handle in the bin. Will be finding a good home for the blades tho.</li>
            <li> Great for the money. The blades can be use three times so the one hundred blades would last for like a year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my first box of Derby blades for a while now, and it gives me a feeling of never running out of blades again. That&#x27;s silly, yes, but true. So many in the box for so little money! Great saver of time and money, and I&#x27;ve been getting great shaves!</li>
