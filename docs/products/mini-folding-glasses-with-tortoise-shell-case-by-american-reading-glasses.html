    <ol>
            <li>Great price, just what I was looking for bought extras</li>
            <li>These are great glasses to carry around in your pocket.  </li>
            <li>Not too great.</li>
            <li>The case is not the most sturdy thing in the world, but I believe it holds up remarkably well considering they take abuse being in my pocket and banging against my keys, etc.</li>
            <li>Well they look nice in the picture.  </li>
            <li>all the others were an excellent, standard size that fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>Nice and compact though, will do in a pinch.</li>
            <li>They fit in your jeans&#x27; watch pocket and fit beautifully.  </li>
            <li>They are MUCH BETTER than these.</li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t wear them for more than 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>but the nose pads are not even close to touching my nose.</li>
            <li>If I could get the nose pads to touch my nose i would love them.</li>
            <li>Have had many sets of these over 25 years.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the stylish plastic leopard.</li>
            <li>Quality seems to be pretty good.</li>
            <li>I have used fold up reading glasses for years, and the ones I have always had have 2 hinges on each side of the nose bridge allowing each side to fold up easily side by side.  </li>
            <li>They seem well made and they fold up easy too.</li>
            <li>Perfect little pair of glasses to carry around to read menus in restauarants and the fine print on items in the store.  </li>
            <li>The other pair I bought were in a less sturdy case but they are ideal and very comfortable so foldable glasses can be convenient and pleasant to use.  </li>
            <li>but the price was right and they&#x27;ll do fine.</li>
            <li>BTW, the reason I buy them by the 1/2 dozen is because when my friends see them, they think they are really cool</li>
            <li>All that&#x27;s true</li>
            <li>These look so cool</li>
            <li>pretty cool stuff!  </li>
            <li>These are very compact and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I thought these would be great to carry in my jeans pocket because they store in a hard case which will not crush easily.  </li>
            <li>My students love to see them in action.  </li>
            <li>The hinge points inward and if you push them up they tend to jab you right between the eyes.  </li>
            <li>Straight in the trash!</li>
            <li>I think a rubic&#x27;s cube was easier to solve than how to fit these back in the case.</li>
            <li>Just be gentle when opening and closing the case</li>
            <li>I have an older pair from years ago that never broke and still work.</li>
            <li>Not really heavy duty,  </li>
            <li>the hinge directly points at the bridge of your nose and jabs when you put them on.</li>
            <li>the folding process is complex to get it right, takes a lot of time, particularly if you&#x27;re doing something else like driving, and have a high risk of scratching the lens in the folding process.  </li>
            <li>My wife loves the small size to fit into her purse.</li>
            <li>Broke in half the first time I opened them.</li>
            <li>the price is good but glasses are uncomfortable to wear for any length of time--purchased for reading when traveling but not useful for this purpose</li>

            <li> As I unfolded these for the first time the arm broke off, the joint was so stiff that the frame gave way!</li>
            <li> First they are hard as heck to fold and unfold.  </li>
            <li> Pretty hard on my nose bridge</li>
            <li> and they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> the bridge is too wide for a human nose and there is no adjusting.</li>
            <li> The nose brdige is too wide except for those noses of a boxer or hockey player.  </li>
            <li> all these glasses are so inexpensive it&#x27;s not a big deal, but perhaps i can alert someone else to save them the trouble.</li>
            <li> this one was so small that it barely fit on my head, and was so uncomfortable i couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> and I suggest putting lock tight on the frame screws</li>
            <li> They fold up into something that takes very little space in your pocket.  </li>
            <li> Really small</li>
            <li> But...man what an uncomfortable pair of glasses.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately these have been relegated to my back-up to the back-up pair.  </li>
            <li> These are painful to wear  at bridge of nose.</li>
            <li> the design on these frames is terrible.  </li>

            <li> Not really heavy duty,  but the price was right and they&#x27;ll do fine.</li>
            <li> These are very compact and easy to use. My wife loves the small size to fit into her purse. This way we never forget our glasses. Quality seems to be pretty good.</li>
            <li> I buy these glasses by the 1/2 dozen.  My students love to see them in action.  Several people have made comments about not being durable.  Yes, these are a disposable set of readers.  They fold up into something that takes very little space in your pocket.  The case is not the most sturdy thing in the world, but I believe it holds up remarkably well considering they take abuse being in my pocket and banging against my keys, etc. that are also in there.  Also, I do not buy this product for the case, I buy it for the glasses.  BTW, the reason I buy them by the 1/2 dozen is because when my friends see them, they think they are really cool and I give them away!  Of all of the pairs I have had, I think one or two broke.  The rest are gifts.  People who get them think I am the nicest guy!</li>
            <li> I have used fold up reading glasses for years, and the ones I have always had have 2 hinges on each side of the nose bridge allowing each side to fold up easily side by side.  Not this pair!  They have 1 hinge in the middle and the folding process is complex to get it right, takes a lot of time, particularly if you&#x27;re doing something else like driving, and have a high risk of scratching the lens in the folding process.  Look for the ones with dual hinges.  They are MUCH BETTER than these.</li>
            <li> Well they look nice in the picture.  But...man what an uncomfortable pair of glasses.  First they are hard as heck to fold and unfold.  I think a rubic&#x27;s cube was easier to solve than how to fit these back in the case. But the kicker is how they feel.  The nose brdige is too wide except for those noses of a boxer or hockey player.  The hinge points inward and if you push them up they tend to jab you right between the eyes.  Unfortunately these have been relegated to my back-up to the back-up pair.  Take my advcie and take a pass on these glasses</li>
            <li> the design on these frames is terrible.  the hinge directly points at the bridge of your nose and jabs when you put them on. i can&#x27;t wear them for more than 30 seconds. i&#x27;m looking for another pair.</li>
            <li> As I unfolded these for the first time the arm broke off, the joint was so stiff that the frame gave way! Straight in the trash!</li>
            <li> i recently ordered six pairs of reading glasses, all different models and designs. all the others were an excellent, standard size that fit perfectly. this one was so small that it barely fit on my head, and was so uncomfortable i couldn&#x27;t use it. don&#x27;t know if i will find someone to give them to, but will try.  all these glasses are so inexpensive it&#x27;s not a big deal, but perhaps i can alert someone else to save them the trouble.</li>
            <li> I bought these and another pair of foldable glasses from a different manufacturer.  I thought these would be great to carry in my jeans pocket because they store in a hard case which will not crush easily.  All that&#x27;s true but once I put them on I realized it would be only in an emergency that I would wear them.  They dig into my nose over the bridge and the sides.  The other pair I bought were in a less sturdy case but they are ideal and very comfortable so foldable glasses can be convenient and pleasant to use.  I can&#x27;t recommend these for routine use.</li>
            <li> Glasses seem sturdy, however, once I got them out of the case, could not fold them back up to get them back in. Arrived with no instructions (and no shipping statement either). The thing is a like a puzzle.</li>
            <li> Great price, just what I was looking for bought extras</li>
            <li> These are great glasses to carry around in your pocket.  They fit in your jeans&#x27; watch pocket and fit beautifully.  Depending on how often you use them, they will wear out over some period of time and need replacing--but they are so convenient.</li>
            <li> These look so cool but the nose pads are not even close to touching my nose. the bridge is too wide for a human nose and there is no adjusting. If I could get the nose pads to touch my nose i would love them.</li>
            <li> Have had many sets of these over 25 years.  Just be gentle when opening and closing the case and I suggest putting lock tight on the frame screws and they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Broke in half the first time I opened them. Buy something else. I have an older pair from years ago that never broke and still work.</li>
            <li> Perfect little pair of glasses to carry around to read menus in restauarants and the fine print on items in the store.  They seem well made and they fold up easy too.</li>
            <li> the price is good but glasses are uncomfortable to wear for any length of time--purchased for reading when traveling but not useful for this purpose</li>
            <li> pretty cool stuff!  I love it.</li>
            <li> Pretty hard on my nose bridge</li>
            <li> Not too great. Really small</li>
            <li> They are not the sturdiest glasses.</li>
            <li> These are painful to wear  at bridge of nose. Nice and compact though, will do in a pinch. Love the stylish plastic leopard. case.</li>
