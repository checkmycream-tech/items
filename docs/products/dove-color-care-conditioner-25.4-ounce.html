            <li>Leave On Conditioner works fairly well in all these areas.</li>
            <li>and I spend a fair amount of time in the pool.</li>
            <li>I love the SPF addition to the hair care of this product, protecting my hair along with my skin, very innovative!</li>

            <li>The fragrance of this conditioner is really nice.</li>

            <li>No scent (good); light to apply and not oily or sticky.  </li>
            <li>love Dove products, so it was no surprise that I was equally thrilled with this leave in conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very lightweight and easy to apply, smells great too!</li>

            <li>But, my hair looks better when I haven&#x27;t used it yet too.</li>
            <li>This one for her was just OK.</li>
            <li>Love Dove products.</li>
            <li>Its a great product and works very well.</li>
            <li>But for my hair, the idea was better than the reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with this conditioner.</li>
            <li>It has a really nice fragrance (a bit tropical/coconut with light floral).</li>
            <li>(I used more like a nickel-sized portion on my shoulder length hair and it was plenty).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but when I tried to purchase more at the grocery, they no longer carried it.</li>
            <li>would they discontinue a product with such great results and reviews!</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>except I think the scent is much better.</li>
            <li>Well anyways I love it and its</li>
            <li>Dove really does make great hair care products.  </li>
            <li>I have used their shampoos and conditioners for quite awhile and was pleased to try the Leave In Conditioner.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that this conditioner does as advertised and keeps my hair softer and with better frizz control and shine.  </li>
            <li>I have no idea how much it&#x27;s contributing to preserving my color, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be hurting it, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is okay.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the look of my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li>I love Dove&#x27;s \\&quot;realistic\\&quot; models campaign</li>
            <li>By both rinsing my hair in water before getting in the pool + using this conditioner after shower/shampooing, I have been able to minimize the damage from the pool.</li>
            <li>My hair is colored and has a lot of static this time of yr.</li>
            <li>So I am willing to spend more to get a good</li>
            <li>The results are pretty good.  </li>
            <li>This product made my hair more mangable and tangle free.</li>
            <li>I love the light scent that it is suddle and not over poering.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any difference as far as that went but the conditioning is great.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it also has much to strong a smell to begin with and the fact that it stays in and does not get rinsed out makes it even stronger of a smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a huge fan of Dove&#x27;s product and this conditioner did not disappoint.</li>
            <li>My hair feels silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have color treated hair and use the Dove color care shampoo and conditioner, and really enjoy them.</li>
            <li>The smell is light and doesn&#x27;t irritate her skin or mine.</li>
            <li>I believe the product is no longer available in stores.</li>
            <li>I am now at a light brown thankfully</li>
            <li>and I thought meh its cheap</li>
            <li>I stuck my finger in a light socket on a lark.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It leaves my hair feeling smooth and silky, and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>I wish it was still available in stores.</li>
            <li>I will be using this from now on to keep my hair looking smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>The Dove Color Leave On condition is great for adding a bit more moisture to the hair and for slicking down frizzies.  </li>
            <li>I highly suggest it if you liked the Hydra TLC or you have some damage.</li>
            <li>Very happy with it, I almost forgot I had this product on my hair until it had dried!  </li>
            <li>It smells great, coats my hair evenly, and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling sticky, dry or crunchy.</li>
            <li>After it dries naturally, it looks just as nice as it did before.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes when I wash my hair using our well water and use rinse that I was out, my hair is still full of tangles.  </li>
            <li>But I was really surprised at how nicely this leave on conditioner works for me and</li>
            <li>This Dove Color Care Leave On Conditioner has a nice coconut scent, goes in easy and smooth, and helps keep tangles down.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is great for those that have trouble getting out of bed for a full shower.</li>
            <li>hair is straight and fine in texture</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy (and a little surprised)</li>
            <li>All round, a great conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair tends to be very susceptible to split ends and breakage since it&#x27;s light</li>
            <li>The scent is fresh and feminine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a nice basic leave in conditioner with a lot of scent.</li>
            <li>Dove seems to make a nice quality of product for an affordable price, my husband especially likes their mens line of shampoos &amp; conditioners.</li>
            <li>and then I can comb it real easily to blow dry.  </li>
            <li>, I usually use a spray leave in condition but with summer and being out and about more in the sun &amp; pools thought something a bit more intense might be better so opted to try this.</li>
            <li>well the lady who did my hair wrecked it royally long story kind of shorter</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t completely obliterate my frizz, but it made a good dent, enough that I would consider it useful.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also just a little more fussy to use than I&#x27;d like, and the results aren&#x27;t dramatically better.</li>
            <li>, I immediately feel like I&#x27;m on the beach as it&#x27;s a very coconut type scent, which thankfully fades quickly away as well.</li>
            <li>She has very light blonde hair, and some hair products make it darker or duller.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried 10 different hair de-frizzing products this year alone and this Dove color care is easily my favorite.</li>
            <li>Only product that keeps my hair from static.</li>
            <li>Well this is almost exactly like that</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, I recently gave in and went to a salon to have my hair colored after thinking I needed to stop doing it myself because I had some damage,</li>
            <li>I have tried many different conditioners--rinse out, spray on, leave in, whatever--with varying results.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is nice and light, fine for a little extra detangling/frizz control.</li>
            <li>(hair dressers always say I have lots of hair but the individual hairs are fine) and just barely reaches the top of my shoulders.  </li>
            <li>I also had to be very careful about how I spread it out because it didn&#x27;t spread as nicely as some others I&#x27;ve used and could leave some spots feeling a bit</li>
            <li>I was hoping a leave-in conditioner would make it less snarly after washing (even though I suspect my straight fine hair is much easier to comb through than most</li>
            <li>I have very long hair and moisture and conditioning are very important.</li>
            <li>The end result is a head full of bouncing and soft to the touch ringlet</li>
            <li>I let my hair air dry for the most part</li>
            <li>Her hair is baby fine, and moderately curly.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you use a proper amount -- if you use a little bit too much it leaves your hair feeling too sticky and causes more tangles.</li>
            <li>It initially helped as a sort of detangler because it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is really helping my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Another thing I really like about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t make her hair look darker.  </li>
            <li>The sun really dries my hair out and products like these are a God send.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t need too much conditioning for your hair</li>
            <li>but I really like this conditioner.</li>
            <li>This summer was very humid</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really expect this to help with detangling, but it does.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a nice tropical fruity scent, coconut maybe, and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair heavy and oily after use.  </li>
            <li>I have used other products with okay results</li>
            <li>I live in Ohio, which is very humid in summer</li>
            <li>I have been using it on a regular basis and definitely will be purchasing more when it is gone</li>
            <li>She has typical fine toddler hair which constantly looks like she stuck her finger in a light socket sticking up all over her head.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too expensive and the product washes out great.</li>
            <li>Once it dried it felt better, but I still prefer rinse out conditioners for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have very dry or coarse hair, this may work better for you than it did for me.</li>
            <li>I first purchased this product at my local grocery chain.</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY product that has consistently worked for me.</li>
            <li>Only when I use expensive conditioner does my ends lie flat, but for Dove product, this is awesome.  </li>
            <li>and it appears that the color is lasting longer than normal as I haven&#x27;t noticed the gray returning quite as fast.</li>
            <li>The white lotion goes on easily over wet hair</li>
            <li>we&#x27;ll see and its just like the other stuff I used to use the texture of my hair is like silk its amazing its a total transformation I like it so much that I think I will go get the shampoo and conditioner that matches, it also helped calm my scalp down because it was so dry and itchy too from all the damage.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, getting hard to find</li>
            <li>Our humidity has been very high for the last couple of weeks, and this product is still working well even against that challenge.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have short but very thick colored hair and have to use more than the recommended amount to fully condition and remove the frizz from my hair but the results are worth it.  </li>
            <li>My hair stays in place without the use of hair sprays and is soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair really soft and manageable even after 24 hrs after application.</li>
            <li>I really like it since my hair is over processed and requires help on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and silky and it shows the condition when I put it on.  </li>
            <li>For the price it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try it, I was using a similar product last summer that was vastly more expensive and didn&#x27;t seen any better.</li>
            <li>While I think it does leave my hair soft, I don&#x27;t always like leaving it on.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t care for is the small packaging, only four ounces, which goes rather quickly in a house with more than one female!</li>
            <li>is not as expensive as a lot of other hair products, but it works better than most I have tried.</li>
            <li>In the morning, I lightly mist her hair with plain water and comb it through.  </li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t use this product for the times when I flat iron my hair straight.</li>
            <li>My hair is a dark brown, but in the hot summer sun (especially if I go to the pool), my hair tends to go reddish and can get pretty brassy looking.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this conditioner for people looking to take back control of their hair.</li>
            <li>hair is on the dry side from being colored and this conditioner really helped to make it feel soft and reduce frizz.</li>
            <li>I have straight hair that tends to go straight to frizz and odd curls in humidity.  </li>
            <li>If I use enough of it and then leave my kind of curly hair to air dry it actually acts like a styling cream, holding my curls together and keeping down frizz.</li>
            <li>I have long wavy fine hair and this conditioner gets out the tangles and puts an end to the dry frizz, such a problem in winter.</li>
            <li>It falls in the realm of not bad and not fantastic.</li>
            <li>I have very fine thin</li>
            <li>I can really recommend this for those with hair that tends on the dry side.</li>
            <li>In Cream which gives my hair body and leaves it soft not dry.  </li>
            <li>It gives my hair the same silkiness clear through the tips that Miracle 10 does.</li>
            <li>Does anyone remember the old Hydra TLC leave in by Sunsilk, I used to buy that religiously.</li>
            <li>Thick but not too thick and has a nice coconut scent that lasts all day!</li>
            <li>Bonus is that some days I can only blow dry my hair and don&#x27;t need any further styling with hot iron, etc.  </li>
            <li>conditioner is pretty middle of the pack for her, if not a bit greasy after applying it (this is partially due to the leave in nature of it).  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t tell you if it&#x27;s really helping with fading since I also use other products with sunscreen for my hair.</li>
            <li>My 3 year old daughter has what we lovingly call \\&quot;crazy hair\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I generally follow a wash-and-go routine and let my hair dry naturally.</li>
            <li>It really tames her hair without making it look slicked down and greasy.</li>
            <li>I comb it through and let her hair dry naturally.  </li>
            <li>I have crazy curly, fine, color treated hair and am constantly on the lookout for a good product that will keep the curls under control without weighing down my hair, making it stiff and crinkly, or leaving it looking like it&#x27;s wet.</li>

            <li> My hair is colored and has a lot of static this time of yr.</li>
            <li> So I am willing to spend more to get a good</li>
            <li> The results are pretty good.  </li>
            <li> This product made my hair more mangable and tangle free.</li>
            <li> I love the light scent that it is suddle and not over poering.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference as far as that went but the conditioning is great.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it also has much to strong a smell to begin with and the fact that it stays in and does not get rinsed out makes it even stronger of a smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a huge fan of Dove&#x27;s product and this conditioner did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> My hair feels silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> I have color treated hair and use the Dove color care shampoo and conditioner, and really enjoy them.</li>
            <li> The smell is light and doesn&#x27;t irritate her skin or mine.</li>
            <li> I believe the product is no longer available in stores.</li>
            <li> I am now at a light brown thankfully</li>
            <li> and I thought meh its cheap</li>
            <li> I stuck my finger in a light socket on a lark.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It leaves my hair feeling smooth and silky, and not greasy.  </li>
            <li> I wish it was still available in stores.</li>
            <li> I will be using this from now on to keep my hair looking smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> The Dove Color Leave On condition is great for adding a bit more moisture to the hair and for slicking down frizzies.  </li>
            <li> I highly suggest it if you liked the Hydra TLC or you have some damage.</li>
            <li> Very happy with it, I almost forgot I had this product on my hair until it had dried!  </li>
            <li> It smells great, coats my hair evenly, and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling sticky, dry or crunchy.</li>
            <li> After it dries naturally, it looks just as nice as it did before.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes when I wash my hair using our well water and use rinse that I was out, my hair is still full of tangles.  </li>
            <li> But I was really surprised at how nicely this leave on conditioner works for me and</li>
            <li> This Dove Color Care Leave On Conditioner has a nice coconut scent, goes in easy and smooth, and helps keep tangles down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is great for those that have trouble getting out of bed for a full shower.</li>
            <li> hair is straight and fine in texture</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy (and a little surprised)</li>
            <li> All round, a great conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to be very susceptible to split ends and breakage since it&#x27;s light</li>
            <li> The scent is fresh and feminine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a nice basic leave in conditioner with a lot of scent.</li>
            <li> Dove seems to make a nice quality of product for an affordable price, my husband especially likes their mens line of shampoos &amp; conditioners.</li>
            <li> and then I can comb it real easily to blow dry.  </li>
            <li> , I usually use a spray leave in condition but with summer and being out and about more in the sun &amp; pools thought something a bit more intense might be better so opted to try this.</li>
            <li> well the lady who did my hair wrecked it royally long story kind of shorter</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t completely obliterate my frizz, but it made a good dent, enough that I would consider it useful.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also just a little more fussy to use than I&#x27;d like, and the results aren&#x27;t dramatically better.</li>
            <li> , I immediately feel like I&#x27;m on the beach as it&#x27;s a very coconut type scent, which thankfully fades quickly away as well.</li>
            <li> She has very light blonde hair, and some hair products make it darker or duller.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried 10 different hair de-frizzing products this year alone and this Dove color care is easily my favorite.</li>
            <li> Only product that keeps my hair from static.</li>
            <li> Well this is almost exactly like that</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I recently gave in and went to a salon to have my hair colored after thinking I needed to stop doing it myself because I had some damage,</li>
            <li> I have tried many different conditioners--rinse out, spray on, leave in, whatever--with varying results.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is nice and light, fine for a little extra detangling/frizz control.</li>
            <li> (hair dressers always say I have lots of hair but the individual hairs are fine) and just barely reaches the top of my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> I also had to be very careful about how I spread it out because it didn&#x27;t spread as nicely as some others I&#x27;ve used and could leave some spots feeling a bit</li>
            <li> I was hoping a leave-in conditioner would make it less snarly after washing (even though I suspect my straight fine hair is much easier to comb through than most</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and moisture and conditioning are very important.</li>
            <li> The end result is a head full of bouncing and soft to the touch ringlet</li>
            <li> I let my hair air dry for the most part</li>
            <li> Her hair is baby fine, and moderately curly.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you use a proper amount -- if you use a little bit too much it leaves your hair feeling too sticky and causes more tangles.</li>
            <li> It initially helped as a sort of detangler because it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is really helping my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another thing I really like about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t make her hair look darker.  </li>
            <li> The sun really dries my hair out and products like these are a God send.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t need too much conditioning for your hair</li>
            <li> but I really like this conditioner.</li>
            <li> This summer was very humid</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really expect this to help with detangling, but it does.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a nice tropical fruity scent, coconut maybe, and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair heavy and oily after use.  </li>
            <li> I have used other products with okay results</li>
            <li> I live in Ohio, which is very humid in summer</li>
            <li> I have been using it on a regular basis and definitely will be purchasing more when it is gone</li>
            <li> She has typical fine toddler hair which constantly looks like she stuck her finger in a light socket sticking up all over her head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too expensive and the product washes out great.</li>
            <li> Once it dried it felt better, but I still prefer rinse out conditioners for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have very dry or coarse hair, this may work better for you than it did for me.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this product at my local grocery chain.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY product that has consistently worked for me.</li>
            <li> Only when I use expensive conditioner does my ends lie flat, but for Dove product, this is awesome.  </li>
            <li> and it appears that the color is lasting longer than normal as I haven&#x27;t noticed the gray returning quite as fast.</li>
            <li> The white lotion goes on easily over wet hair</li>
            <li> we&#x27;ll see and its just like the other stuff I used to use the texture of my hair is like silk its amazing its a total transformation I like it so much that I think I will go get the shampoo and conditioner that matches, it also helped calm my scalp down because it was so dry and itchy too from all the damage.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, getting hard to find</li>
            <li> Our humidity has been very high for the last couple of weeks, and this product is still working well even against that challenge.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have short but very thick colored hair and have to use more than the recommended amount to fully condition and remove the frizz from my hair but the results are worth it.  </li>
            <li> My hair stays in place without the use of hair sprays and is soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair really soft and manageable even after 24 hrs after application.</li>
            <li> I really like it since my hair is over processed and requires help on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and silky and it shows the condition when I put it on.  </li>
            <li> For the price it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try it, I was using a similar product last summer that was vastly more expensive and didn&#x27;t seen any better.</li>
            <li> While I think it does leave my hair soft, I don&#x27;t always like leaving it on.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t care for is the small packaging, only four ounces, which goes rather quickly in a house with more than one female!</li>
            <li> is not as expensive as a lot of other hair products, but it works better than most I have tried.</li>
            <li> In the morning, I lightly mist her hair with plain water and comb it through.  </li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t use this product for the times when I flat iron my hair straight.</li>
            <li> My hair is a dark brown, but in the hot summer sun (especially if I go to the pool), my hair tends to go reddish and can get pretty brassy looking.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this conditioner for people looking to take back control of their hair.</li>
            <li> hair is on the dry side from being colored and this conditioner really helped to make it feel soft and reduce frizz.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair that tends to go straight to frizz and odd curls in humidity.  </li>
            <li> If I use enough of it and then leave my kind of curly hair to air dry it actually acts like a styling cream, holding my curls together and keeping down frizz.</li>
            <li> I have long wavy fine hair and this conditioner gets out the tangles and puts an end to the dry frizz, such a problem in winter.</li>
            <li> It falls in the realm of not bad and not fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have very fine thin</li>
            <li> I can really recommend this for those with hair that tends on the dry side.</li>
            <li> In Cream which gives my hair body and leaves it soft not dry.  </li>
            <li> It gives my hair the same silkiness clear through the tips that Miracle 10 does.</li>
            <li> Does anyone remember the old Hydra TLC leave in by Sunsilk, I used to buy that religiously.</li>
            <li> Thick but not too thick and has a nice coconut scent that lasts all day!</li>
            <li> Bonus is that some days I can only blow dry my hair and don&#x27;t need any further styling with hot iron, etc.  </li>
            <li> conditioner is pretty middle of the pack for her, if not a bit greasy after applying it (this is partially due to the leave in nature of it).  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell you if it&#x27;s really helping with fading since I also use other products with sunscreen for my hair.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old daughter has what we lovingly call \\&quot;crazy hair\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I generally follow a wash-and-go routine and let my hair dry naturally.</li>
            <li> It really tames her hair without making it look slicked down and greasy.</li>
            <li> I comb it through and let her hair dry naturally.  </li>
            <li> I have crazy curly, fine, color treated hair and am constantly on the lookout for a good product that will keep the curls under control without weighing down my hair, making it stiff and crinkly, or leaving it looking like it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> I really like it  leave the hair so soft but comes in very small amount</li>
            <li> Sometimes though my hair is still dry, especially during the southern California summer.</li>
            <li> If I use too much, or use it over dry hair, I get a limp and greasy look, probably from the mineral oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the difference really is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much it really protects the color, though.  </li>
            <li> It seems to make things a little softer, but not as much as I had expected from a leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I tried several other stores locally and finally found it at Amazon.</li>
            <li> If I use just tiny dab over dry ends, it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a few applications, I found that this conditioner really left my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I wash my hair as usual in the shower, towel dry, use a dime-size and distribute through very damp hair, then comb it out.  </li>
            <li> with long hair, I don&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
            <li> I recently had my hair \\&quot;balayaged\\&quot; and kind of hated it, but besides that - it left my hair a bit rough feeling from its previously \\&quot;never been dyed or treated\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not objectionable and does give a little extra softening/frizz control in the short term.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wash, condition, brush or comb and leave to dry.  </li>
            <li> hair felt slippery with conditioner when I went to dry it but didn&#x27;t seem to be any easier to comb through than with the rinse out conditioners.  </li>
            <li> but my hair was nearing breaking point and dry as all get out</li>
            <li> I have dry, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I rub a little in my hands and put it all through my hair, especially the ends.</li>
            <li> She does like Dove products in general, usually having a pleasing scent and a quality product.  </li>
            <li> I get my hands wet and rub a teeny dot of this leave-in through her hair and comb it.</li>
            <li> , looks like the bottle is almost empty</li>
            <li> /&gt;You should apply it to damp hair and initially, it tends to look like it is still wet or heavy.</li>
            <li> The texture is a pretty standard thickness for a conditioner (not too thick, not too thin) and I found that a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I use less it works as you would hope, softening and smoothing your dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously, as summer is just starting, I don&#x27;t know what the long-term effects of this product will be, but we&#x27;ve already had a few days of well over 100 degrees, and this conditioner has kept my hair from drying out without making it feel weighted down.</li>
            <li> but like I said, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Checked other stores--</li>
            <li> product look and feel is similar to a thin regular rinse out</li>
            <li> Did not make my hair dry after I blow dried it out .</li>
            <li> My only complaint is if it&#x27;s windy I do get some flyaway frizziness when I&#x27;m using the Dove product.</li>
            <li> I have dark hair and color it blond.</li>
            <li> I was intrigued by the idea of leave-in conditioner -- all the product doesn&#x27;t get washed down the drain.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the idea of leaving anything on my hair to weigh it down and add a product for dirt and dust to stick to.</li>
            <li> It keeps the frizz down.</li>
            <li> My hair seems conditioned without being greasy or weighed down...</li>
            <li> This product may help with keeping the color (not really sure) but it leaves my hair dry.</li>
            <li> But the effects aren&#x27;t dramatic, nor does it last very long</li>
            <li> My hair is smoother, with less frizzies.</li>
            <li> One less step in the care process.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t miss that slimy feel of typical after-shampoo conditioner on my skin in the shower.  </li>
            <li> and I use the recommended quarter-sized dollop or a little less.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She typically has her bath at night, and of course her hair gets messy again when she sleeps on it.  </li>
            <li> little bit leaves my hair softer.</li>
            <li> Keeps the frizzies down and styling is easier!</li>
            <li> this it too heavy for a leave in conditioner</li>
            <li> it felt as though it would look greasy when it dried and worried about gooping up my towel with the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It is too heavy for that.</li>
            <li> Leave in conditioners help tame the hair and keep me from looking like</li>
            <li> After her hair is towel dried and just slightly damp, I apply a very small amount of this (about the size of a dime) and work it through her hair.  </li>
            <li> Hair dried as usual, and my usual fuzzy ends just didn&#x27;t not materialize at all ,</li>
            <li> Very little is required to get flyaway control and to protect my hair from the elements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small bottle at 4 ounces</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this leave in conditioner instead of the usual after-shampoo conditioner for the past month.  </li>
            <li> This one really hasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had to bleach my hair out from a weird multicolor black mess.</li>
            <li> made it hardly noticable that i did anything to my hair.</li>
            <li> I always turn my head downwards to dry my hair to try to give it some volume as it is very thin.  </li>
            <li> matter how careful I am, my hair gets tangled when washing it and combing out the tangles can be difficult.</li>
            <li> my likes both t0o thick for a leave in conditioner and way too smelly for any product.</li>
            <li> It is somewhat thick, and so I sometimes wash it out after 45 minutes or an hour.  </li>
            <li> I have used Dove leave in conditioner in the past until I was unable to buy it in the store.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this product is my holy grail of hair products like some other reviews seem to feel, nor is it a waste or awful.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think this is a bad product</li>
            <li> This time of the year is really bad for my hair.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too terribly noticeable</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> My hair is a dark brown, but in the hot summer sun (especially if I go to the pool), my hair tends to go reddish and can get pretty brassy looking. So, even though I don&#x27;t color my hair, I often buy hair care products intended for people who do because I want the same hydrating properties and UV protection that they get from these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved this leave on conditioner. It initially helped as a sort of detangler because it goes on smoothly. But it works as a styling product, too. It reminds me quite a bit of the [[ASIN:B00006L9L1 Got 2b Playful Texturizing Creme Pomade 2 oz (50 ml)]] that I already use, except that it comes in a squirt bottle instead of a canister. Very little is required to get flyaway control and to protect my hair from the elements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, as summer is just starting, I don&#x27;t know what the long-term effects of this product will be, but we&#x27;ve already had a few days of well over 100 degrees, and this conditioner has kept my hair from drying out without making it feel weighted down. I can really recommend this for those with hair that tends on the dry side.</li>
            <li> No scent (good); light to apply and not oily or sticky.  Hair dried as usual, and my usual fuzzy ends just didn&#x27;t not materialize at all , and I always use conditioner on my hair.  Only when I use expensive conditioner does my ends lie flat, but for Dove product, this is awesome.  Very happy with it, I almost forgot I had this product on my hair until it had dried!  My hair feels silky smooth.  All round, a great conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Miracle 10 leave in on my hair. I have very long hair and moisture and conditioning are very important. So I am willing to spend more to get a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy (and a little surprised) how well the Dove Color Care Leave on conditioner worked. It gives my hair the same silkiness clear through the tips that Miracle 10 does. But, my hair looks better when I haven&#x27;t used it yet too. The conditioner is really helping my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with long hair, I don&#x27;t need a lot. I have used it for almost a month and I still have lots left. The scent is fresh and feminine. The bottle is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have color treated hair and use the Dove color care shampoo and conditioner, and really enjoy them. Sometimes though my hair is still dry, especially during the southern California summer. I use this leave-in after towel drying and combing my hair. I rub a little in my hands and put it all through my hair, especially the ends. If I use enough of it and then leave my kind of curly hair to air dry it actually acts like a styling cream, holding my curls together and keeping down frizz. If I use less it works as you would hope, softening and smoothing your dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I guess you wouldn&#x27;t buy this specifically for a toddler&#x27;s hair, I like this for my daughter as well. She has typical fine toddler hair which constantly looks like she stuck her finger in a light socket sticking up all over her head. When the baby conditioner spray isn&#x27;t doing the trick I get my hands wet and rub a teeny dot of this leave-in through her hair and comb it. It really tames her hair without making it look slicked down and greasy. The smell is light and doesn&#x27;t irritate her skin or mine.</li>
            <li> I have been using this leave in conditioner for about 3 weeks now.  It has a nice tropical fruity scent, coconut maybe, and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair heavy and oily after use.  The directions state to apply a quarter sized amount into damp hair and leave in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have short but very thick colored hair and have to use more than the recommended amount to fully condition and remove the frizz from my hair but the results are worth it.  I wash, condition, brush or comb and leave to dry.  My hair stays in place without the use of hair sprays and is soft and manageable.  I colored my hair the same time I began using this conditioner and it appears that the color is lasting longer than normal as I haven&#x27;t noticed the gray returning quite as fast.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight and easy to apply, smells great too! I love the SPF addition to the hair care of this product, protecting my hair along with my skin, very innovative! The only thing I don&#x27;t care for is the small packaging, only four ounces, which goes rather quickly in a house with more than one female! For the size and price, I give this 4 stars, but definitely recommend the product based in merits alone.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old daughter has what we lovingly call \\&quot;crazy hair\\&quot;.  Her hair is baby fine, and moderately curly.  Without the use of some type of hair product, her hair gets fuzzy and flyaway.  After her hair is towel dried and just slightly damp, I apply a very small amount of this (about the size of a dime) and work it through her hair.  I try to avoid the scalp as much as possible.  I comb it through and let her hair dry naturally.  The end result is a head full of bouncing and soft to the touch ringlet curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She typically has her bath at night, and of course her hair gets messy again when she sleeps on it.  In the morning, I lightly mist her hair with plain water and comb it through.  After it dries naturally, it looks just as nice as it did before.  Our humidity has been very high for the last couple of weeks, and this product is still working well even against that challenge.  Another thing I really like about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t make her hair look darker.  She has very light blonde hair, and some hair products make it darker or duller.  This does not have that effect.</li>
            <li> I have very fine thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product look and feel is similar to a thin regular rinse out conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for my hair this it too heavy for a leave in conditioner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it also has much to strong a smell to begin with and the fact that it stays in and does not get rinsed out makes it even stronger of a smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for my likes both t0o thick for a leave in conditioner and way too smelly for any product.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is nice and light, fine for a little extra detangling/frizz control. But the effects aren&#x27;t dramatic, nor does it last very long (I was my hair once or twice a week in the summer, and after several hours, it looks about the same as it did when I wasn&#x27;t using any leave-in conditioner) or seem to have a lasting overall effect (after several weeks, my hair looks about the same), so I&#x27;m only giving it 3 stars. It&#x27;s not objectionable and does give a little extra softening/frizz control in the short term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is light and pleasant, the container dispenses easily and with control.</li>
            <li> My wife has tried countless conditioners to help with her hair and control the frizz.  This leave on (in?) conditioner is pretty middle of the pack for her, if not a bit greasy after applying it (this is partially due to the leave in nature of it).  She does like Dove products in general, usually having a pleasing scent and a quality product.  This one for her was just OK.</li>
            <li> Love Dove products. Never leaves a residue on your hair or on your skin. This product made my hair more mangable and tangle free. I love the light scent that it is suddle and not over poering. All you need a liitle and it will go along way. Did not make my hair dry after I blow dried it out . Its a great product and works very well.</li>
            <li> I have crazy curly, fine, color treated hair and am constantly on the lookout for a good product that will keep the curls under control without weighing down my hair, making it stiff and crinkly, or leaving it looking like it&#x27;s wet. Dove Color Care Leave On Conditioner works fairly well in all these areas. My only complaint is if it&#x27;s windy I do get some flyaway frizziness when I&#x27;m using the Dove product. For the most part though, I&#x27;m very happy with it. It smells great, coats my hair evenly, and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling sticky, dry or crunchy. I would definitely use it again.</li>
            <li> It seems to make things a little softer, but not as much as I had expected from a leave-in conditioner. I also had to be very careful about how I spread it out because it didn&#x27;t spread as nicely as some others I&#x27;ve used and could leave some spots feeling a bit gunky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you take care with how you use it, it does help. It&#x27;s also just a little more fussy to use than I&#x27;d like, and the results aren&#x27;t dramatically better. It falls in the realm of not bad and not fantastic.</li>
            <li> I was intrigued by the idea of leave-in conditioner -- all the product doesn&#x27;t get washed down the drain.  But for my hair, the idea was better than the reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is straight and fine in texture (hair dressers always say I have lots of hair but the individual hairs are fine) and just barely reaches the top of my shoulders.  I was hoping a leave-in conditioner would make it less snarly after washing (even though I suspect my straight fine hair is much easier to comb through than most hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair felt slippery with conditioner when I went to dry it but didn&#x27;t seem to be any easier to comb through than with the rinse out conditioners.  I generally follow a wash-and-go routine and let my hair dry naturally. I didn&#x27;t like that it felt as though it would look greasy when it dried and worried about gooping up my towel with the conditioner.  Once it dried it felt better, but I still prefer rinse out conditioners for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think this is a bad product, I just didn&#x27;t like it for my hair.  If you have very dry or coarse hair, this may work better for you than it did for me.</li>
            <li> This time of the year is really bad for my hair. My hair tends to be very susceptible to split ends and breakage since it&#x27;s light and I spend a fair amount of time in the pool. The sun really dries my hair out and products like these are a God send.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried 10 different hair de-frizzing products this year alone and this Dove color care is easily my favorite. The conditioner smells great and doesn&#x27;t get all over your fingers should you decide to put your hands through your hair. It isn&#x27;t too terribly noticeable either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This product is amazing for frizzy hair. It&#x27;s not too expensive and the product washes out great. I highly recommend this conditioner for people looking to take back control of their hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with this conditioner. It has a really nice fragrance (a bit tropical/coconut with light floral). The texture is a pretty standard thickness for a conditioner (not too thick, not too thin) and I found that a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is on the dry side from being colored and this conditioner really helped to make it feel soft and reduce frizz. It&#x27;s a small bottle at 4 ounces but like I said, a little goes a long way (I used more like a nickel-sized portion on my shoulder length hair and it was plenty).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a huge fan of Dove&#x27;s product and this conditioner did not disappoint. All in all a great product!</li>
            <li> I have a preference for Dove skin &amp; hair care products and this one did not disappoint (but then again, this is just coz they suit my skin and hair type well)</li>
            <li> Excellent for permed or color-treated hair!</li>
            <li> Took this on vacation to protect my hair from sun damage and it is a nice portable size. It smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Only product that keeps my hair from static.</li>
            <li> I have dark hair and color it blond. This product may help with keeping the color (not really sure) but it leaves my hair dry. I like the Nourishing smoothing Leave In Cream which gives my hair body and leaves it soft not dry.  If you don&#x27;t need too much conditioning for your hair this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST leave-on conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. It makes my hair really soft and manageable even after 24 hrs after application.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, getting hard to find</li>
            <li> I first purchased this product at my local grocery chain. I chose it because I like Dove products and their shampoo is great. I liked the conditioner but when I tried to purchase more at the grocery, they no longer carried it. I tried several other stores locally and finally found it at Amazon. The product is no longer found on the Dove website so I purchased six bottles from Amazon (a life-time supply?). I believe the product is no longer available in stores.</li>
            <li> I have used Dove leave in conditioner in the past until I was unable to buy it in the store.  I really like it since my hair is over processed and requires help on a regular basis.  I have used other products with okay results but I really like this conditioner.</li>
            <li> This leave-in conditioner has a strong but pleasant floral scent. The white lotion goes on easily over wet hair (I apply from the hair ends, up to the scalp). The silicones in the formulation make it glide well. The glycerin adds conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little bit leaves my hair softer. My hair is smoother, with less frizzies. If I use too much, or use it over dry hair, I get a limp and greasy look, probably from the mineral oil. If I use just tiny dab over dry ends, it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a nice basic leave in conditioner with a lot of scent.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Thick but not too thick and has a nice coconut scent that lasts all day!</li>
            <li> This summer was very humid and I was searching for a &amp;#34;Leave IN&amp;#34; conditioner to control the frizzy hair.  It works wonderfully, and I will continue to buy it.  It also saves a step in washing my hair, I do not have to rinse after applying it.  My beautician could not recommend anything, but I found this myself.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I regret I didn&#x27;t discover it sooner-- I have long wavy fine hair and this conditioner gets out the tangles and puts an end to the dry frizz, such a problem in winter. I would walk by strangers and they would ask me what I was wearing, it smelled so nice! Only started using it about two months ago,and on my last two trips to the store, I couldn&#x27;t find it. Checked other stores-- no luck. Finally called Dove and was told they have DISCONTINUED this product!!!!  WHY!!!! would they discontinue a product with such great results and reviews! I just went online and bought 5 bottles(at an obscene price) so I can have time to figure out what I&#x27;m going to do without this product.  Go online, call the company, let them know!! Don&#x27;t leave us in the lurch!! Bring back this conditioner!!</li>
            <li> I really like it  leave the hair so soft but comes in very small amount, looks like the bottle is almost empty</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Makes my hair soft and silky and it shows the condition when I put it on.  So this was a very good buy for me.</li>
            <li> Does anyone remember the old Hydra TLC leave in by Sunsilk, I used to buy that religiously. Well this is almost exactly like that except I think the scent is much better. I love this stuff, I recently gave in and went to a salon to have my hair colored after thinking I needed to stop doing it myself because I had some damage, well the lady who did my hair wrecked it royally long story kind of shorter I had to bleach my hair out from a weird multicolor black mess. I am now at a light brown thankfully but my hair was nearing breaking point and dry as all get out so I went to wal mart and I saw this and I thought meh its cheap we&#x27;ll see and its just like the other stuff I used to use the texture of my hair is like silk its amazing its a total transformation I like it so much that I think I will go get the shampoo and conditioner that matches, it also helped calm my scalp down because it was so dry and itchy too from all the damage. Well anyways I love it and its made it hardly noticable that i did anything to my hair. I highly suggest it if you liked the Hydra TLC or you have some damage.</li>
            <li> Dove really does make great hair care products.  I have used their shampoos and conditioners for quite awhile and was pleased to try the Leave In Conditioner.  I have straight hair that tends to go straight to frizz and odd curls in humidity.  Leave in conditioners help tame the hair and keep me from looking like I stuck my finger in a light socket on a lark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that this conditioner does as advertised and keeps my hair softer and with better frizz control and shine.  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this leave-in conditioner as a sort of anti-frizz treatment.  When my hair is having frizz issues I&#x27;ve been smoothing some through my hair.  The results are pretty good.  This stuff smells nice, and it smooths through hair easily.  It didn&#x27;t completely obliterate my frizz, but it made a good dent, enough that I would consider it useful.  This stuff is supposed to be a \\&quot;color care\\&quot; product.  I have no idea how much it&#x27;s contributing to preserving my color, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be hurting it, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Keeps the frizzies down and styling is easier!</li>
            <li> Sometimes when I wash my hair using our well water and use rinse that I was out, my hair is still full of tangles.  I use about a 1/2 teaspoon of this and rub it into my hair and then I can comb it real easily to blow dry.  I always turn my head downwards to dry my hair to try to give it some volume as it is very thin.  This does not leave any greasy residue and still gives my hair lots of volume.  I&#x27;ll continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the idea of leaving anything on my hair to weigh it down and add a product for dirt and dust to stick to. But I was really surprised at how nicely this leave on conditioner works for me and my frizzy haired daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should apply it to damp hair and initially, it tends to look like it is still wet or heavy. I let my hair air dry for the most part but once it was finished drying, it fluffed up and looked wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A really nice conditioner especially when you don&#x27;t have time to put one on in the shower, let it sit and then rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great for those that have trouble getting out of bed for a full shower. One less step in the care process.</li>
            <li> I recently had my hair \\&quot;balayaged\\&quot; and kind of hated it, but besides that - it left my hair a bit rough feeling from its previously \\&quot;never been dyed or treated\\&quot; softness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Dove products, so it was no surprise that I was equally thrilled with this leave in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair feeling smooth and silky, and not greasy.  I have been using it on a regular basis and definitely will be purchasing more when it is gone</li>
            <li> This leave in conditioner has the look and feel of regular conditioner. I&#x27;m not sure what the difference really is. I have dry, curly hair. This conditioner is okay. It makes my hair a bit softer when I wear my hair curly. However, I don&#x27;t use this product for the times when I flat iron my hair straight. It is too heavy for that. The fragrance of this conditioner is really nice. It has a fruity scent that I like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this leave in conditioner instead of the usual after-shampoo conditioner for the past month.  My hair loves it and looks great.  I wash my hair as usual in the shower, towel dry, use a dime-size and distribute through very damp hair, then comb it out.  Without this product, a comb wouldn&#x27;t even get through my hair after just shampooing.  Smells great.  Bonus is that some days I can only blow dry my hair and don&#x27;t need any further styling with hot iron, etc.  Don&#x27;t miss that slimy feel of typical after-shampoo conditioner on my skin in the shower.  I don&#x27;t ever want to be without it!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I wish it was still available in stores. It keeps the frizz down.</li>
            <li> Works great on dyed or permed hair..</li>
            <li> I have tried many different conditioners--rinse out, spray on, leave in, whatever--with varying results. This is the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter how careful I am, my hair gets tangled when washing it and combing out the tangles can be difficult. I didn&#x27;t really expect this to help with detangling, but it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need a lot of this product. I have short hair and I use the recommended quarter-sized dollop or a little less. The easiest way to apply it is to dispense the conditioner into the palm of one hand, then rub your hands together to spread it over the palms of both hands. Run your hands through your hair to transfer the conditioner to your hair, then comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part about this product is that my hair is sleeker and smoother than it was before I started using it. I love the look of my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00AWLB9G6 Dove Color Care Leave On Conditioner, 4 Ounce]] is not as expensive as a lot of other hair products, but it works better than most I have tried. I will be using this from now on to keep my hair looking smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> The Dove Color Leave On condition is great for adding a bit more moisture to the hair and for slicking down frizzies.  I&#x27;m not sure how much it really protects the color, though.  I didn&#x27;t notice any difference as far as that went but the conditioning is great.  I love Dove&#x27;s \\&quot;realistic\\&quot; models campaign and I like their products. This one really hasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> I started using this as a leave in conditioner after swimming and showering at the gym a couple of years ago.  I use a lycra (not latex) swimcap, so my hair is exposed to the pool chemicals.  By both rinsing my hair in water before getting in the pool + using this conditioner after shower/shampooing, I have been able to minimize the damage from the pool.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this product for 2 yrs. They do not sell it in the stores in my city. My hair is colored and has a lot of static this time of yr. This is the ONLY product that has consistently worked for me.</li>
            <li> This Dove Color Care Leave On Conditioner has a nice coconut scent, goes in easy and smooth, and helps keep tangles down. Just make sure you use a proper amount -- if you use a little bit too much it leaves your hair feeling too sticky and causes more tangles. Otherwise I have no big complaints, and I could see myself using this product again in the future.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this product is my holy grail of hair products like some other reviews seem to feel, nor is it a waste or awful. I color my hair (to cover some gray strands and to just give it a richer deeper shade of brown) so fading is a concern, I usually use a spray leave in condition but with summer and being out and about more in the sun &amp; pools thought something a bit more intense might be better so opted to try this. I do like the smell, I immediately feel like I&#x27;m on the beach as it&#x27;s a very coconut type scent, which thankfully fades quickly away as well. My hair seems conditioned without being greasy or weighed down... I couldn&#x27;t tell you if it&#x27;s really helping with fading since I also use other products with sunscreen for my hair. For the price it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try it, I was using a similar product last summer that was vastly more expensive and didn&#x27;t seen any better. Dove seems to make a nice quality of product for an affordable price, my husband especially likes their mens line of shampoos &amp; conditioners.</li>
            <li> After a few applications, I found that this conditioner really left my hair soft and manageable.  I live in Ohio, which is very humid in summer and I think it has helped to control a bit of the frizz that I have to contend with on a daily basis.  While I think it does leave my hair soft, I don&#x27;t always like leaving it on.  It is somewhat thick, and so I sometimes wash it out after 45 minutes or an hour.  This does not seem to impact effectiveness.</li>
