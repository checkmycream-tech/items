    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>/&gt;Recommendation: A wonderful Nivea product, heartily recommend, will purchase again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a bunch of Nivea&#x27;s &#x27;Touch of _______&#x27; products and like them all, and this is a great addition to the line.</li>
            <li>Nivea is known for making great products and this one fits the bill.</li>
            <li>However, there are some here that I know aren&#x27;t so great</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B00BVKL08E Nivea Body Touch of Frangipani shower gel]] smells great and cleans well.</li>
            <li>That might be great for some people because it won&#x27;t interfere with your perfume, but as I don&#x27;t wear perfume I noticed the lack of lingering scent.</li>
            <li>Well, plenty because this is very nice.  </li>
            <li>On the plus side the fragrance is very nice but doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In summary, another nice product from Nivea!</li>
            <li>The smell holds on for a good bit, too, but it isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li>the price it&#x27;s being sold for and the size of the bottle, it seems to be a good value.</li>
            <li>I purchased Nivea Frangipani because I loved the smell from the bottle.</li>
            <li>- in addition to the wonderful smell, it is not drying to my skin, and I&#x27;m 57, so that is an important fact.</li>
            <li>But aside from that, it does feel good on the skin while washing and rinses away</li>
            <li>gel smells REALLY good IMO</li>
            <li>The scent is lightly floral, very pleasant.</li>
            <li>It lathers up nice and rinses off good also.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d use this again for sure!</li>
            <li>It has a nice floral fragrance, which I like, since I always choose florals.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it does a spectacular job of hydrating.</li>
            <li>I liked the product, but it didn&#x27;t stand out as exceptional.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>Was looking for a nice plumeria scent.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice shower gel.</li>
            <li>This shower gel had a nice scent and was nice and sudsy.</li>
            <li>but this was nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Nivea&#x27;s aftershave balm for many years, so I was more than happy to try this shower gel.</li>
            <li>And it has a nice flowery scent.</li>
            <li>I found this to be a nice, but not overpowering scent, that has a robust lather.</li>
            <li>This is another body wash that lathers well and smells nice.</li>
            <li>This is the best of their new bath line</li>
            <li>but I find it very fresh smelling while leaving a pleasant scent to the body after use.  </li>
            <li>This body wash lathers up nicely, which is very important to me.  </li>
            <li>This shower gel works fine and smells good.</li>
            <li>I liked the way the bottle top works.</li>
            <li>Just ok, i didn&#x27;t feel anything, but it smells nice</li>
            <li>If the price were right we&#x27;d buy this product again, but are also happy to stick with what we&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li>It does lather rather nicely and imparts a very clean feeling to the skin after use.  </li>
            <li>I buy all kinds, most of them more high-end than Nivea.  </li>
            <li>That one was creamier and more moisturizing than this one.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know, I also tend to expect more from Nivea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Instead I would probably go for more of a citrusy or pine aroma.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve dropped it many times.  </li>
            <li>and I believe fewer ingredients, but all-natural ones would be of more benefit to a body wash that someone uses every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s outstanding, in my case.</li>
            <li>The Shea enriched products from Bath and Body Works do a better job with hydration.</li>
            <li>Why do I love Nivea shower gel?  </li>
            <li>I love that.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Nivea Body Touch of Frangipani Hydrating Shower Gel has a nice, light scent.</li>
            <li>I look for a product that lathers nicely without leaving a filmy residue and washes off clean</li>
            <li>However, once on my shower puff, the lovely smell vanished and turned into a strong, hideous alcohol smell.</li>
            <li>- Nivea is a good brand - however, I didn&#x27;t find it to be exceptional or enticing enough (it&#x27;s stated on the bottle that the product entices) so as to seek it out to purchase and use again.</li>
            <li>That is normally important in the high-end washes I buy to layer with lotions or perfumes, but for this type of product, it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>I was concerned that this fragrance might be too floral or on the strong side</li>
            <li>my opinion, the fragrance is fairly gender neutral and doesn&#x27;t linger long after use even though it&#x27;s very prominent while using the product.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like soaps with a strong scent, then you should probably try something else.</li>
            <li>My wife has commented specifically that she likes how smooth and hydrated her skin feels.  </li>
            <li>This gel may be more appropriate for a woman as it is very fragrant.  </li>
            <li>And I know there are those who will say the bubbles are really just to sell the idea that you&#x27;re getting clean and that soap that doesn&#x27;t get all sudsy is just as effective...</li>
            <li>It DOES smell very nice... sensual and enticing, and it does leave my skin feeling clean, smooth and smelling terrific.</li>
            <li>I just choose it for its color for first time,then I found that I love this smell</li>
            <li>I already love Nivea&#x27;s body lotion, so this was a logical choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant, but sometimes it is a little overwhelming, so if you are looking for a body wash with a light scent, this isn&#x27;t it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell was unique, light, and fresh but not intoxicating and did not linger.</li>
            <li>like the smell, however I&#x27;m not in love with the fact that it doesn&#x27;t get very sudsy in my loofah.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, it has a nice, enticing smell, neither masculine or feminine, rather one that anyone can use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell if that&#x27;s true or not, so</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li>However, at Amazon&#x27;s reduced price, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>Perhaps the best way I can put it is my skin feels a little smoother and indeed \\&quot;fresher\\&quot;, and the results are certainly pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Luckily my toes haven&#x27;t been hit yet.  </li>
            <li>Certainly it&#x27;s adequate as a body wash, though my wife (who tried it out for this review) doesn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li>It lathers well without using much, cleans my skin without leaving a residue (but a nice after-smell that lasts a short while), and leaves it VERY smooth as well.  </li>
            <li>large bottle is extraordinarily inexpensive, which is the primary merit of the product.</li>
            <li>Much nicer than after using a bar soap like Lever 2000, which I think is a pretty dang good soap as far as bar soaps</li>
            <li>But the more I used it, the more my skin felt dry, itchy and in need of lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has great lather, it does a great job cleaning, it has a subtle yet high-end scent, and it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is light and gentle.</li>
            <li>Overall a nice product</li>
            <li>I recently tried a Dove moisturizing body wash that I thought was pretty nice.  </li>
            <li>Pleasant scent that I&#x27;m not familiar with which smells stronger when you&#x27;re using it, but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>This is positive for me because I&#x27;ve got allergies and am really sensitive to strong scents.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, my personal preference is for more of a brisk wake up scent for a morning shower gel, so I probably won&#x27;t be ordering this again.  </li>
            <li>and I also like light natural smelling scents.  </li>
            <li>I smell pretty and fresh all day, which I really like.</li>
            <li>love the way it smells; it really IS strongly reminiscent of Hawaiian flowers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m aware of issues with ingredients in soaps, shampoos, body washes, etc.</li>
            <li>first, I thought I was itchy because I might have been allergic to it.</li>
            <li>I was intrigued by Nivea&#x27;s body wash because I am a sucker for a great smelling and hydrating body wash.</li>
            <li>and I will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li>A quarter sized gel will clean up your entire body, but the smell is something similar to a cheap soap, a cheap cologne.</li>
            <li>I like the scent, which is only lightly floral and fresh smelling.</li>
            <li>Nicely fragranced, not too floral, perfumed or sweet.&lt;br /&gt;Lathers well, even in our very hard water.&lt;br /&gt;A little bathing luxury that leaves skin smooth and refreshed, gently cleansing and a good value.&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance is pleasant while bathing and barely noticeable once skin is dry, so there&#x27;s no competing with perfumes.</li>
            <li>The soap lathers well and the hydration properties seem fine; no dry skin or irritation or anything like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I havnet used it enough to know if it&#x27;s truly \\&quot;hydrating\\&quot; over the long run, but it feels pretty good after about a week.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something new, it&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li>The floral scent is not too strong or feminine for a man to use regularly.  </li>
            <li>However, since it&#x27;s Summer, my skin doesn&#x27;t need the extra moisture so much and this body wash is fine for now.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t talk about how all the variant recipes interrelate (i.e., what the practical difference between orchid blossoms and diamond powder is), but they&#x27;re all quality soaps, and Touch of Frangipani maintains the standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, in terms of intense moisture and hydration, Olay and Dove have Nivea beat.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps it&#x27;s not supposed to, but I found that it didn&#x27;t lather much</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t that sensitive, and handles \\&quot;regular\\&quot; soaps and gels well, so while this shower gel is certainly much better than a cheap store brand, for me the long-term results with this product aren&#x27;t much different from what I&#x27;d been getting with the various decent shower gels my wife brings home after shopping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the kind of scent that doesn&#x27;t overpower, but leaves a very slightly detectable smell as she walks by.  </li>
            <li>Nivea has other scents I like better</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than everything else out there, and I&#x27;ve tried just about all the other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, rinses easily and didn&#x27;t dry out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Seems</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d say you&#x27;d want to buy this product when you need a body wash, don&#x27;t want to spend much, and aren&#x27;t too terribly particular.</li>
            <li>This pretty blue bottle of Nivea shower gel smells fresh and floral, leaving the lightest scent on my skin after showering.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is just right (not too strong) and it leaves just the right amount of scent behind and the soap action is really clean and prone to leave a residue.  </li>
            <li>(Sodium Laureth Sulfate and parabens, in particular),</li>
            <li>decent shower gel.</li>
            <li>So what I do is use tropical and fruit-scented soaps, shampoos, body washes (and other products), that smell great and coincidentally, EXACTLY like those I&#x27;m not allowed to eat due to potential blood sugar issues.  </li>
            <li>The price is good for the product and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the delicate smell of this product and amazing little beads that cleanse your skin.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed that this shower gel gets my body any more or less clean than any other shower gel we have used in our house.</li>
            <li>I was sitting earlier and looked at my legs and could easily see the dry skin, so I&#x27;d say it hasn&#x27;t done much to hydrate them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Being one who very much enjoys the feel of showering with shower gels, I recently tried the new Nivea Touch of Frangipani.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t really notice it very much after you get out of the shower and dry off.</li>
            <li>I use a body wash daily and certainly have my favorites.  </li>
            <li>In Hawaii we&#x27;d say plumeria (a little more generic</li>
            <li>/&gt;It lathers nicely -- better than other brands I&#x27;ve used -- and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li>I feel like I get half of my body clean and run out of bubbles.</li>
            <li>If you have really sensitive skin or your skin doesn&#x27;t respond well to \\&quot;regular\\&quot; soaps or gels, give this a try and see if it works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it make it feel like have a bath beside sea, wow</li>
            <li>I tried using it a few more times with the same results.</li>
            <li>many people either loved or hated the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light fruity floral scent, stronger than we usually go for but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>This is going to sound a little weird, but since I&#x27;ve had type 2 diabetes for years now, I don&#x27;t eat sweet things (fruits, juices, uh, edible flowers, etc.), but I like the way they smell VERY much.  </li>
            <li>I like Nivea products in general.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a male with quite dry skin, and I choose shower gels based largely on smell, with an eye on moisturization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried Nivea&#x27;s body wash, not knowing much about frangipani other than it is a nice-smelling Hawaiian, tropical flower.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t seem to be worth almost double the money for 50% less the product than the others I currently have.</li>
            <li>It does have a slight oily feel, but again that&#x27;s intended and not too much, which is probably why they call it \\&quot;touch of\\&quot;.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> That is normally important in the high-end washes I buy to layer with lotions or perfumes, but for this type of product, it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> I was concerned that this fragrance might be too floral or on the strong side</li>
            <li> my opinion, the fragrance is fairly gender neutral and doesn&#x27;t linger long after use even though it&#x27;s very prominent while using the product.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like soaps with a strong scent, then you should probably try something else.</li>
            <li> My wife has commented specifically that she likes how smooth and hydrated her skin feels.  </li>
            <li> This gel may be more appropriate for a woman as it is very fragrant.  </li>
            <li> And I know there are those who will say the bubbles are really just to sell the idea that you&#x27;re getting clean and that soap that doesn&#x27;t get all sudsy is just as effective...</li>
            <li> It DOES smell very nice... sensual and enticing, and it does leave my skin feeling clean, smooth and smelling terrific.</li>
            <li> I just choose it for its color for first time,then I found that I love this smell</li>
            <li> I already love Nivea&#x27;s body lotion, so this was a logical choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant, but sometimes it is a little overwhelming, so if you are looking for a body wash with a light scent, this isn&#x27;t it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell was unique, light, and fresh but not intoxicating and did not linger.</li>
            <li> like the smell, however I&#x27;m not in love with the fact that it doesn&#x27;t get very sudsy in my loofah.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, it has a nice, enticing smell, neither masculine or feminine, rather one that anyone can use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if that&#x27;s true or not, so</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li> However, at Amazon&#x27;s reduced price, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the best way I can put it is my skin feels a little smoother and indeed \\&quot;fresher\\&quot;, and the results are certainly pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Luckily my toes haven&#x27;t been hit yet.  </li>
            <li> Certainly it&#x27;s adequate as a body wash, though my wife (who tried it out for this review) doesn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> It lathers well without using much, cleans my skin without leaving a residue (but a nice after-smell that lasts a short while), and leaves it VERY smooth as well.  </li>
            <li> large bottle is extraordinarily inexpensive, which is the primary merit of the product.</li>
            <li> Much nicer than after using a bar soap like Lever 2000, which I think is a pretty dang good soap as far as bar soaps</li>
            <li> But the more I used it, the more my skin felt dry, itchy and in need of lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has great lather, it does a great job cleaning, it has a subtle yet high-end scent, and it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is light and gentle.</li>
            <li> Overall a nice product</li>
            <li> I recently tried a Dove moisturizing body wash that I thought was pretty nice.  </li>
            <li> Pleasant scent that I&#x27;m not familiar with which smells stronger when you&#x27;re using it, but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> This is positive for me because I&#x27;ve got allergies and am really sensitive to strong scents.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, my personal preference is for more of a brisk wake up scent for a morning shower gel, so I probably won&#x27;t be ordering this again.  </li>
            <li> and I also like light natural smelling scents.  </li>
            <li> I smell pretty and fresh all day, which I really like.</li>
            <li> love the way it smells; it really IS strongly reminiscent of Hawaiian flowers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m aware of issues with ingredients in soaps, shampoos, body washes, etc.</li>
            <li> first, I thought I was itchy because I might have been allergic to it.</li>
            <li> I was intrigued by Nivea&#x27;s body wash because I am a sucker for a great smelling and hydrating body wash.</li>
            <li> and I will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> A quarter sized gel will clean up your entire body, but the smell is something similar to a cheap soap, a cheap cologne.</li>
            <li> I like the scent, which is only lightly floral and fresh smelling.</li>
            <li> Nicely fragranced, not too floral, perfumed or sweet.&lt;br /&gt;Lathers well, even in our very hard water.&lt;br /&gt;A little bathing luxury that leaves skin smooth and refreshed, gently cleansing and a good value.&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance is pleasant while bathing and barely noticeable once skin is dry, so there&#x27;s no competing with perfumes.</li>
            <li> The soap lathers well and the hydration properties seem fine; no dry skin or irritation or anything like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I havnet used it enough to know if it&#x27;s truly \\&quot;hydrating\\&quot; over the long run, but it feels pretty good after about a week.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something new, it&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li> The floral scent is not too strong or feminine for a man to use regularly.  </li>
            <li> However, since it&#x27;s Summer, my skin doesn&#x27;t need the extra moisture so much and this body wash is fine for now.  </li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t talk about how all the variant recipes interrelate (i.e., what the practical difference between orchid blossoms and diamond powder is), but they&#x27;re all quality soaps, and Touch of Frangipani maintains the standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, in terms of intense moisture and hydration, Olay and Dove have Nivea beat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps it&#x27;s not supposed to, but I found that it didn&#x27;t lather much</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t that sensitive, and handles \\&quot;regular\\&quot; soaps and gels well, so while this shower gel is certainly much better than a cheap store brand, for me the long-term results with this product aren&#x27;t much different from what I&#x27;d been getting with the various decent shower gels my wife brings home after shopping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the kind of scent that doesn&#x27;t overpower, but leaves a very slightly detectable smell as she walks by.  </li>
            <li> Nivea has other scents I like better</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than everything else out there, and I&#x27;ve tried just about all the other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , rinses easily and didn&#x27;t dry out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Seems</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d say you&#x27;d want to buy this product when you need a body wash, don&#x27;t want to spend much, and aren&#x27;t too terribly particular.</li>
            <li> This pretty blue bottle of Nivea shower gel smells fresh and floral, leaving the lightest scent on my skin after showering.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is just right (not too strong) and it leaves just the right amount of scent behind and the soap action is really clean and prone to leave a residue.  </li>
            <li> (Sodium Laureth Sulfate and parabens, in particular),</li>
            <li> decent shower gel.</li>
            <li> So what I do is use tropical and fruit-scented soaps, shampoos, body washes (and other products), that smell great and coincidentally, EXACTLY like those I&#x27;m not allowed to eat due to potential blood sugar issues.  </li>
            <li> The price is good for the product and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the delicate smell of this product and amazing little beads that cleanse your skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed that this shower gel gets my body any more or less clean than any other shower gel we have used in our house.</li>
            <li> I was sitting earlier and looked at my legs and could easily see the dry skin, so I&#x27;d say it hasn&#x27;t done much to hydrate them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Being one who very much enjoys the feel of showering with shower gels, I recently tried the new Nivea Touch of Frangipani.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t really notice it very much after you get out of the shower and dry off.</li>
            <li> I use a body wash daily and certainly have my favorites.  </li>
            <li> In Hawaii we&#x27;d say plumeria (a little more generic</li>
            <li> /&gt;It lathers nicely -- better than other brands I&#x27;ve used -- and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li> I feel like I get half of my body clean and run out of bubbles.</li>
            <li> If you have really sensitive skin or your skin doesn&#x27;t respond well to \\&quot;regular\\&quot; soaps or gels, give this a try and see if it works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it make it feel like have a bath beside sea, wow</li>
            <li> I tried using it a few more times with the same results.</li>
            <li> many people either loved or hated the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light fruity floral scent, stronger than we usually go for but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> This is going to sound a little weird, but since I&#x27;ve had type 2 diabetes for years now, I don&#x27;t eat sweet things (fruits, juices, uh, edible flowers, etc.), but I like the way they smell VERY much.  </li>
            <li> I like Nivea products in general.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male with quite dry skin, and I choose shower gels based largely on smell, with an eye on moisturization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried Nivea&#x27;s body wash, not knowing much about frangipani other than it is a nice-smelling Hawaiian, tropical flower.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to be worth almost double the money for 50% less the product than the others I currently have.</li>
            <li> It does have a slight oily feel, but again that&#x27;s intended and not too much, which is probably why they call it \\&quot;touch of\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not overbearing at all, a floral smell that lingers slightly after shower.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using other Nivea Moisturizing Gels lately, and this one certainly matched up to them in keeping my super-dry skin in decent condition.</li>
            <li> The color is a little off-putting, actually; too obviously dyed blue.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin all year long</li>
            <li> This Nivea Frangipani scent body wash was definitely a quality addition to the other brands I use.  </li>
            <li> have* noticed that my skin does feel different after using this, compared to some of the other shower gels we&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find that this fragrance stays with me for very long after my shower.  </li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> However, this shower gel doesn&#x27;t hydrate my skin which tends to be dry.</li>
            <li> product cleans well without leaving your skin feeling dry.  </li>
            <li> There is just one problem - My skin feels dry and itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but my skin feels extremely dry after using this shower gel.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry you out but doesn&#x27;t make you feel moist or silky or</li>
            <li> My legs don&#x27;t look or feel as dry as they were before I started using this product.</li>
            <li> Ahhh, they were so dry and burned!</li>
            <li> There is only a slight scent after rinsing and I have to bring my arm to my nose to notice it.  </li>
            <li> product is no different than what I describe above, but it has a delicate flowery scent for a lady.  </li>
            <li> I was curious about \\&quot;fangipani\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> This container will go a long way because relatively little is needed for thorough cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, however, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s no better than any other body wash I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this product has about an average degree of scent.  </li>
            <li> only negative to speak of is that the bottle is finished with an ultra-smooth exterior, and tapered shape.  </li>
            <li> Average.</li>
            <li> I actually do think it does hydrate, at least some.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t get that tight skin feeling from this product like I do from some other shower gels.</li>
            <li> The combination means that it&#x27;s hard to hold onto in the shower when your hands are wet and soapy.  </li>
            <li> Having the base be so much bigger than the top makes holding it difficult</li>
            <li> After washing with it, my skin feels dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not leave your skin all dried up</li>
            <li> It comes out \\&quot;runny\\&quot; where you think it is going to be too thin to really cling, but in fact, it comes out thin and is instead really, really thick!</li>
            <li> And this has not been drying to my skin as some soap products have been in the past.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how hydrating it was</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very hydrating, but nor does it dry my skin out too bad after using for about 2 or 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> It drizzles onto the bath puff, and makes lots of luxurious bubbles and foam, even in our hard well water.</li>
            <li> No more Nivea for me!</li>
            <li> I tend not to like gels with floral scents and was hoping that this one was subtle, but it isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> the MSRP, this is not a good value, though.</li>
            <li> I think I might be allergic to ingredients in the soap. :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit of a body wash connoisseur.  I buy all kinds, most of them more high-end than Nivea.  I often use philosophy, Crabtree &amp; Evelyn, Perlier and Bath and Body Works.  I recently tried a Dove moisturizing body wash that I thought was pretty nice.  That one was creamier and more moisturizing than this one.  However, since it&#x27;s Summer, my skin doesn&#x27;t need the extra moisture so much and this body wash is fine for now.  It has a nice floral fragrance, which I like, since I always choose florals.  I don&#x27;t want to smell like food.  I don&#x27;t find that this fragrance stays with me for very long after my shower.  That is normally important in the high-end washes I buy to layer with lotions or perfumes, but for this type of product, it&#x27;s okay.  It doesn&#x27;t interfere with whatever perfume I choose to wear.  This body wash lathers up nicely, which is very important to me.  The bottle says it has moisture beads, but again, I don&#x27;t find it to be extra-moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I was curious about \\&quot;fangipani\\&quot;.  It sounds like an Italian dessert or a tropical fruit, but nope, it&#x27;s a plant, in the plumeria family.  The scent is lightly floral, very pleasant. It lingers, but not for too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lathers nicely -- better than other brands I&#x27;ve used -- and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li> I like the scent, which is only lightly floral and fresh smelling. It&#x27;s not very hydrating, but nor does it dry my skin out too bad after using for about 2 or 3 weeks. That said, it&#x27;s summer... I don&#x27;t know, I also tend to expect more from Nivea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the MSRP, this is not a good value, though. However, at Amazon&#x27;s reduced price, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> This product smells like those Hawaiian Lei&#x27;s they used to give tourists at the airport in Honolulu.  The floral scent is not too strong or feminine for a man to use regularly.  It does have a slight oily feel, but again that&#x27;s intended and not too much, which is probably why they call it \\&quot;touch of\\&quot;.  Both the scent and the feel are subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my personal preference is for more of a brisk wake up scent for a morning shower gel, so I probably won&#x27;t be ordering this again.  Instead I would probably go for more of a citrusy or pine aroma.  But if getting \\&quot;Lei&#x27;d\\&quot; every morning appeals to you, then \\&quot;Touch of Frangipani\\&quot; may be what you want!</li>
            <li> This shower gel works fine and smells good.</li>
            <li> I use a body wash daily and certainly have my favorites.  This Nivea Frangipani scent body wash was definitely a quality addition to the other brands I use.  I look for a product that lathers nicely without leaving a filmy residue and washes off clean and I also like light natural smelling scents.  I was concerned that this fragrance might be too floral or on the strong side but I find it very fresh smelling while leaving a pleasant scent to the body after use.  The only thing I wish was different with this product is the design of the bottle.  Having the base be so much bigger than the top makes holding it difficult and I&#x27;ve dropped it many times.  Luckily my toes haven&#x27;t been hit yet.  But for fragrance and cleansing power I do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Nicely fragranced, not too floral, perfumed or sweet.&lt;br /&gt;Lathers well, even in our very hard water.&lt;br /&gt;A little bathing luxury that leaves skin smooth and refreshed, gently cleansing and a good value.&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance is pleasant while bathing and barely noticeable once skin is dry, so there&#x27;s no competing with perfumes.</li>
            <li> Did you know frangipani is plumeria? I didn&#x27;t know this before getting this body wash... But when I used it I was like, \\&quot;This smells like Bath &amp; Body Works...\\&quot; and then I looked on line and saw it&#x27;s just another name for plumeria! Cool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell, however I&#x27;m not in love with the fact that it doesn&#x27;t get very sudsy in my loofah. I feel like I get half of my body clean and run out of bubbles. And I know there are those who will say the bubbles are really just to sell the idea that you&#x27;re getting clean and that soap that doesn&#x27;t get all sudsy is just as effective... But I like the bubbles! I can&#x27;t say it does a spectacular job of hydrating. I was sitting earlier and looked at my legs and could easily see the dry skin, so I&#x27;d say it hasn&#x27;t done much to hydrate them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really and truly the only plus to this body wash is the smell... I smell pretty and fresh all day, which I really like. Overall, however, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s no better than any other body wash I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a bunch of Nivea&#x27;s &#x27;Touch of _______&#x27; products and like them all, and this is a great addition to the line. I really can&#x27;t talk about how all the variant recipes interrelate (i.e., what the practical difference between orchid blossoms and diamond powder is), but they&#x27;re all quality soaps, and Touch of Frangipani maintains the standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it smells; it really IS strongly reminiscent of Hawaiian flowers. The smell holds on for a good bit, too, but it isn&#x27;t overpowering. The soap lathers well and the hydration properties seem fine; no dry skin or irritation or anything like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, another nice product from Nivea!</li>
            <li> I liked the product, but it didn&#x27;t stand out as exceptional.&lt;br /&gt;It lathers well, rinses easily and didn&#x27;t dry out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Seems many people either loved or hated the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, the fragrance is fairly gender neutral and doesn&#x27;t linger long after use even though it&#x27;s very prominent while using the product.&lt;br /&gt;At the price it&#x27;s being sold for and the size of the bottle, it seems to be a good value.</li>
            <li> what can you say about shower gel?  Well, plenty because this is very nice.  The fragrance is just right (not too strong) and it leaves just the right amount of scent behind and the soap action is really clean and prone to leave a residue.  Nivea is known for making great products and this one fits the bill.</li>
            <li> A quarter sized gel will clean up your entire body, but the smell is something similar to a cheap soap, a cheap cologne. It&#x27;s not something I would use on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also a 16.9 oz bottle; compare that with the standard sized (12 oz) Axe gel if you want to weigh in the price difference.</li>
            <li> I tried Nivea&#x27;s body wash, not knowing much about frangipani other than it is a nice-smelling Hawaiian, tropical flower.  This is going to sound a little weird, but since I&#x27;ve had type 2 diabetes for years now, I don&#x27;t eat sweet things (fruits, juices, uh, edible flowers, etc.), but I like the way they smell VERY much.  So what I do is use tropical and fruit-scented soaps, shampoos, body washes (and other products), that smell great and coincidentally, EXACTLY like those I&#x27;m not allowed to eat due to potential blood sugar issues.  Sort of like of cheating without cheating, or getting the essence of the terrific smell without eating the fruit itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This body wash works well for me.  It lathers well without using much, cleans my skin without leaving a residue (but a nice after-smell that lasts a short while), and leaves it VERY smooth as well.  In my opinion, it has a nice, enticing smell, neither masculine or feminine, rather one that anyone can use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m aware of issues with ingredients in soaps, shampoos, body washes, etc. but I&#x27;m not a scholar on what to or what not to include products like these. However, there are some here that I know aren&#x27;t so great (Sodium Laureth Sulfate and parabens, in particular), and I believe fewer ingredients, but all-natural ones would be of more benefit to a body wash that someone uses every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this body wash.  It DOES smell very nice... sensual and enticing, and it does leave my skin feeling clean, smooth and smelling terrific.</li>
            <li> The fragrance of the Frangipani makes me feel like I am taking a shower in Hawaii.  Lots of suds.  And this has not been drying to my skin as some soap products have been in the past.  I liked the way the bottle top works. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a nice plumeria scent.  Didn&#x27;t find it here at all. Won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> I purchased Nivea Frangipani because I loved the smell from the bottle. However, once on my shower puff, the lovely smell vanished and turned into a strong, hideous alcohol smell. I tried using it a few more times with the same results. I will not use this soap but will try to remainder of the soap as a hand soap refill. Too bad.&lt;br /&gt;Update: I tried this as a hand soap refill. Well, it destroyed my hands! Ahhh, they were so dry and burned! I think I might be allergic to ingredients in the soap. :( No more Nivea for me!</li>
            <li> This is a nice shower gel. It comes out \\&quot;runny\\&quot; where you think it is going to be too thin to really cling, but in fact, it comes out thin and is instead really, really thick! The scent is pleasant, but sometimes it is a little overwhelming, so if you are looking for a body wash with a light scent, this isn&#x27;t it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest issue is the price. At $7+ a bottle for only 16.9oz, it is the most expensive shower gel AND the smallest bottle in my shower. It didn&#x27;t seem to be worth almost double the money for 50% less the product than the others I currently have. I probably wouldn&#x27;t seek this out to purchase because of the price.</li>
            <li> This shower gel had a nice scent and was nice and sudsy. It also worked well as a bubble bath,too. The price is good for the product and a little goes a long way. Nivea has other scents I like better but this was nice. I&#x27;m not sure how hydrating it was but it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I&#x27;d use this again.</li>
            <li> If you have really sensitive skin or your skin doesn&#x27;t respond well to \\&quot;regular\\&quot; soaps or gels, give this a try and see if it works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this for a while I haven&#x27;t noticed that this shower gel gets my body any more or less clean than any other shower gel we have used in our house. I *have* noticed that my skin does feel different after using this, compared to some of the other shower gels we&#x27;ve had. Perhaps the best way I can put it is my skin feels a little smoother and indeed \\&quot;fresher\\&quot;, and the results are certainly pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I like this product, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s outstanding, in my case. My skin isn&#x27;t that sensitive, and handles \\&quot;regular\\&quot; soaps and gels well, so while this shower gel is certainly much better than a cheap store brand, for me the long-term results with this product aren&#x27;t much different from what I&#x27;d been getting with the various decent shower gels my wife brings home after shopping. My wife is of the same opinion also. If the price were right we&#x27;d buy this product again, but are also happy to stick with what we&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nivea&#x27;s aftershave balm for many years, so I was more than happy to try this shower gel. While I prefer Dove soap, this shower gel gets the job done. And it has a nice flowery scent. If you&#x27;re looking for something new, it&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li> I like Nivea products in general.  I found this to be a nice, but not overpowering scent, that has a robust lather. The gel is not overly drying and thus lives up to its name.  I&#x27;d use this again for sure!</li>
            <li> I just choose it for its color for first time,then I found that I love this smell , it make it feel like have a bath beside sea, wow</li>
            <li> On the plus side the fragrance is very nice but doesn&#x27;t linger. The shower gel lathers and cleans well.  However, this shower gel doesn&#x27;t hydrate my skin which tends to be dry. The Shea enriched products from Bath and Body Works do a better job with hydration.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this product has about an average degree of scent.  It&#x27;s a light fruity floral scent, stronger than we usually go for but not overpowering.  It hasn&#x27;t given anyone in our scent-sensitive house any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product cleans well without leaving your skin feeling dry.  This container will go a long way because relatively little is needed for thorough cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative to speak of is that the bottle is finished with an ultra-smooth exterior, and tapered shape.  The combination means that it&#x27;s hard to hold onto in the shower when your hands are wet and soapy.  I dropped it twice before I realized the problem and planned accordingly.</li>
            <li> Pleasant scent that I&#x27;m not familiar with which smells stronger when you&#x27;re using it, but not overpowering.  There is only a slight scent after rinsing and I have to bring my arm to my nose to notice it.  This is positive for me because I&#x27;ve got allergies and am really sensitive to strong scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t create a lot of lather, but it&#x27;s obvious the soap is on the washcloth and my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product claims to be hydrating.  I can&#x27;t tell if that&#x27;s true or not, so if it is, not by much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A decent shower gel.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00BVKL08E Nivea Body Touch of Frangipani shower gel]] smells great and cleans well. There is just one problem - My skin feels dry and itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a \\&quot;hydrating\\&quot; and it doesn&#x27;t hydrate. After washing with it, my skin feels dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I thought I was itchy because I might have been allergic to it. But the more I used it, the more my skin felt dry, itchy and in need of lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s just me but my skin feels extremely dry after using this shower gel. I can&#x27;t recommend it</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife to try.  I have been a big fan of Nivea for Men products for years.  Why do I love Nivea shower gel?  It has great lather, it does a great job cleaning, it has a subtle yet high-end scent, and it lasts a long time.  It&#x27;s better than everything else out there, and I&#x27;ve tried just about all the other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is no different than what I describe above, but it has a delicate flowery scent for a lady.  It&#x27;s the kind of scent that doesn&#x27;t overpower, but leaves a very slightly detectable smell as she walks by.  I love that. My wife has commented specifically that she likes how smooth and hydrated her skin feels.  Much nicer than after using a bar soap like Lever 2000, which I think is a pretty dang good soap as far as bar soaps go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give this a try, I think you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> As a resident of Hawaii I&#x27;m always intrigued by products that claim to have Hawaiian content. In the case of this body wash, it&#x27;s \\&quot;frangipani.\\&quot; In Hawaii we&#x27;d say plumeria (a little more generic but that&#x27;s what we say). So I&#x27;ve got to give them strike one on Hawaiian content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The large bottle is extraordinarily inexpensive, which is the primary merit of the product. Certainly it&#x27;s adequate as a body wash, though my wife (who tried it out for this review) doesn&#x27;t like the smell. Hydration? Average. Doesn&#x27;t dry you out but doesn&#x27;t make you feel moist or silky or anything like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say you&#x27;d want to buy this product when you need a body wash, don&#x27;t want to spend much, and aren&#x27;t too terribly particular. Four stars for overall value for the money.</li>
            <li> I tend not to like gels with floral scents and was hoping that this one was subtle, but it isn&#x27;t.  This gel may be more appropriate for a woman as it is very fragrant.  It does lather rather nicely and imparts a very clean feeling to the skin after use.  If you are looking for a moisturizing gel and like floral scents, give this a whirl.  If you don&#x27;t like soaps with a strong scent, then you should probably try something else.</li>
            <li> This is another body wash that lathers well and smells nice. It&#x27;s pretty ordinary, I guess. The color is a little off-putting, actually; too obviously dyed blue. I havnet used it enough to know if it&#x27;s truly \\&quot;hydrating\\&quot; over the long run, but it feels pretty good after about a week.</li>
            <li> I was intrigued by Nivea&#x27;s body wash because I am a sucker for a great smelling and hydrating body wash. I already love Nivea&#x27;s body lotion, so this was a logical choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, in terms of intense moisture and hydration, Olay and Dove have Nivea beat. The smell was unique, light, and fresh but not intoxicating and did not linger. That might be great for some people because it won&#x27;t interfere with your perfume, but as I don&#x27;t wear perfume I noticed the lack of lingering scent.</li>
            <li> This is the best of their new bath line</li>
            <li> This pretty blue bottle of Nivea shower gel smells fresh and floral, leaving the lightest scent on my skin after showering. I love it. It is a \\&quot;thin\\&quot; shower gel, not a big creamy one. It drizzles onto the bath puff, and makes lots of luxurious bubbles and foam, even in our hard well water. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And - in addition to the wonderful smell, it is not drying to my skin, and I&#x27;m 57, so that is an important fact. Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation: A wonderful Nivea product, heartily recommend, will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Being one who very much enjoys the feel of showering with shower gels, I recently tried the new Nivea Touch of Frangipani.  The fragrance is light and gentle. I like a scent that is a bit stronger - something that gives you that scent of its cleanliness, not just the feel. But aside from that, it does feel good on the skin while washing and rinses away clearly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps it&#x27;s not supposed to, but I found that it didn&#x27;t lather much and I had to use quite a bit of it while showering. Overall, it&#x27;s a good product - Nivea is a good brand - however, I didn&#x27;t find it to be exceptional or enticing enough (it&#x27;s stated on the bottle that the product entices) so as to seek it out to purchase and use again.</li>
            <li> The Nivea Body Touch of Frangipani Hydrating Shower Gel has a nice, light scent. You don&#x27;t really notice it very much after you get out of the shower and dry off. It lathers up nice and rinses off good also. I don&#x27;t feel like there is any residue left on my skin afterwards. I actually do think it does hydrate, at least some. I have dry skin all year long and I have noticed a difference in the dryness of the skin on my legs after having used this for a couple of weeks. My legs don&#x27;t look or feel as dry as they were before I started using this product. I also don&#x27;t get that tight skin feeling from this product like I do from some other shower gels. Overall a nice product and I will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male with quite dry skin, and I choose shower gels based largely on smell, with an eye on moisturization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel smells REALLY good IMO, it&#x27;s not overbearing at all, a floral smell that lingers slightly after shower.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using other Nivea Moisturizing Gels lately, and this one certainly matched up to them in keeping my super-dry skin in decent condition.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the delicate smell of this product and amazing little beads that cleanse your skin. It does not leave your skin all dried up and the smell is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Just ok, i didn&#x27;t feel anything, but it smells nice</li>
