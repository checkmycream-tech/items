            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>After washing the mud off, my face is more brighter and softer.</li>
            <li>Will buy more of this mud mask</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try the product.</li>
            <li>this leaves my skin feeling baby soft and looking beautiful.  </li>
            <li>It smells pretty good which is important.</li>
            <li>Real worth for money.</li>
            <li>I have looked high and low for a mud mask, and this one is the best I have found.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I got this.</li>
            <li>Just checking the jar and is original product from Israel.</li>
            <li>But, this is the true.</li>
            <li>I love this mask, it cleans my face really well.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast, the product goes on smooth and washes off so easy.</li>
            <li>Other than that precautionary step, this is a great mask.</li>
            <li>I received this item quickly without any issues.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, the mask did not dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li>Clears you&#x27;re skin totally worth the buy</li>
            <li>Not sure if the product itself is great just yet as I just began using it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work as good as one other mud mask I have tried but It works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that the jar was so big, good for the money..........</li>
            <li>This makes me feel very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Just be aware of this before you buy.</li>
            <li>then what it did before, and it also made my skin super soft in just one use.</li>
            <li>It smells very chemically, and has yet to do anything positive for my face.</li>
            <li>When the package arrived, the outside of the container looked fine, with the Amazon sticker over the lid intact.</li>
            <li>but it really sucked.</li>
            <li>So the whole body was covered with this oily residue layer.</li>
            <li>so i am very cautious with what i use</li>
            <li>and my skin absolutely hates this stuff.</li>
            <li>When I opened it, the water is on the top, and you can pour it out a little bit.</li>
            <li>I do notice it doesn&#x27;t suck as much out of my face as my old mud mask.</li>
            <li>(on Saturday) informing of the soiled product, and by Monday I got a new replacement product...</li>
            <li>then i slowly coverd my whole face and after months of use i love it.  </li>
            <li>I have eczema and very sensitive acne proned skin</li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li>This makes my skin so soft and clear!!</li>
            <li>I could tell because it wasn&#x27;t on straight and had a very big air bubble like the sticker was crinkled.</li>
            <li>my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive combination skin....</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for anyone with sensitive skin that is also prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li>That plastic was not thin at all in fact it&#x27;s very thick and strong</li>
            <li>If you have done a peel or anything other than very gentle exfoliation within 24 hours before using, it will burn a bit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other masks but feel this one really pulls the impurities out and my skin is so soft after.</li>
            <li>But I will be going back to my old mask after this runs out.</li>
            <li>The failed attempt with this actually made me buy stuff to make my own masks...</li>
            <li>I received this only a few days ago, but after the first use I must say I have noticed a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>Helps not make a mess and keeps it really formed and even.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, plus its much cheaper for the amount you get compared to all the other dead sea products</li>
            <li>It was a cool and soothing mask, and my skin was noticeably brighter and subtle.  </li>
            <li>Luckily it was small enough to cover with tape but that doesn&#x27;t work very long.</li>

            <li> I have really sensitive skin and have trouble finding masks that don&#x27;t burn when applied.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, I used the product, and unlike other facial masks, this one did not &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I just put the mud into a new jar now so less is wasted.</li>
            <li> a total mess to use.</li>
            <li> However when I received it the inner clear plastic covering had broken and it leaked throughout the box.</li>
            <li> I ordered this Veris Dead Sea mask, and the order came from an outside seller, and fulfilled by Amazon.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to decide whether I want to get this mask based on reading other reviews.</li>
            <li> So I stopped using it on my face, like other people suggest, it might work well on your body,</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way i havent even used 1/4 of the jar in 4 months of doing it weekly!  </li>
            <li> When I got my product, it was soiled (due to defect in wrapping).  </li>
            <li> I think it contains salt and other minerals so that may be why.</li>
            <li> All of the black stuff washed off, but when you carefully rub on your skin, it has this oily layer residues  from the mask.</li>
            <li> This is not a good product for someone who has a lot of dry or open places on their face.  </li>
            <li> cause it&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
            <li> The texture is slightly watery but it makes it go on smoother.</li>
            <li> I had some wind and sunburn last weekend, and boy did it BURN when I went to do my usual regimen!!  </li>
            <li> I am a crazed fanatic of mud masks.</li>
            <li> I mean nothing change at all.</li>
            <li> The 1-star rating is due to the horrible packaging, or failure to inspect the product prior to mailing it to me.</li>
            <li> And the problem is not just the artificial fragrance its all the other ingredients!</li>
            <li> I did get a punctured jar and the mud was coming out of the side very slowly.</li>
            <li> When I opened the lid the plastic that was supposed to seal the mud was broken, of course, and all goopy and muddy.</li>
            <li> This product arrived to me with a broken seal...</li>
            <li> leave my skin in worse condition than before.</li>
            <li> Sad.</li>
            <li> what was wrong with me.</li>
            <li> It is just a mud which is fake</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sorry for saying that.</li>
            <li> Too bad, as I was looking forward to trying this mud mask.</li>
            <li> Burning, redness, heating up, breakouts, pores, all of the bad effects you could ever imagine, happened to me.</li>
            <li> but I hate what it did to my face.</li>
            <li> but it has a load of crap in it!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent Product. Real worth for money. You can feel the change once you apply the product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this Veris Dead Sea mask, and the order came from an outside seller, and fulfilled by Amazon. When the package arrived, the outside of the container looked fine, with the Amazon sticker over the lid intact. But the inside plastic cover was sliced open, and the contents were spilled out. As soon as I opened the container, the mud mask spilled all over my hands. I contacted Amazon for a refund, and they accepted my return and promptly refunded my money. I give Amazon 5-stars for customer service. The 1-star rating is due to the horrible packaging, or failure to inspect the product prior to mailing it to me. Too bad, as I was looking forward to trying this mud mask.</li>
            <li> I am a very easily pleased person and I like the actual mud in the container I still use it today. It doesn&#x27;t work as good as one other mud mask I have tried but It works pretty well. I read a review that the jar was punctured and hoped hoped hoped I would not get one like that. I did get a punctured jar and the mud was coming out of the side very slowly. Luckily it was small enough to cover with tape but that doesn&#x27;t work very long. There is lots of mud in the jar so it&#x27;s not a big deal but it really sucked. The packaging wasn&#x27;t damaged at all but I did notice the sticker on the jar was placed OVER the puncture. I could tell because it wasn&#x27;t on straight and had a very big air bubble like the sticker was crinkled. And also there was NO damage to the sticker, not even a scratch. That plastic was not thin at all in fact it&#x27;s very thick and strong so it makes me wonder how it even could have happened. When I opened the lid the plastic that was supposed to seal the mud was broken, of course, and all goopy and muddy. Just be aware of this before you buy. I wont be buying this stuff again cause it&#x27;s not worth the money. I am a crazed fanatic of mud masks. I put one on every night, (even though they say you shouldn&#x27;t). I just put the mud into a new jar now so less is wasted. The mud is alright it is definitely not the best I have had. It smells pretty good which is important. I do notice it doesn&#x27;t suck as much out of my face as my old mud mask. The best thing about this product is the quantity. But I will be going back to my old mask after this runs out.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that the jar was so big, good for the money.......... but it was leaking and not safety sealed and to be honest, a total mess to use. But when  you do use it, it&#x27;s effective. you can feel it working for sure.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try the product. However when I received it the inner clear plastic covering had broken and it leaked throughout the box. Has to send back for a refund. Sad.</li>
            <li> This makes me feel very soft and smooth. I like the way it makes my skin feel refreshed. Like I just came from the spa.</li>
            <li> This product arrived to me with a broken seal... It smells very chemically, and has yet to do anything positive for my face.</li>
            <li> My husband and myself both used this mask and it did not irritate my skin at all. He looked great afterwards I attribute this to the fact that he never washed his face. The fact that I saw a more noticeable difference on his face leads me to believe it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to decide whether I want to get this mask based on reading other reviews. But by hearing the awesomeness of this &amp;#34;dead sea&amp;#34; substance, I decide to give it a try. I was so excited when I got this. When I opened it, the water is on the top, and you can pour it out a little bit. I didn&#x27;t mind, thought it was just an liquid type. So I TRIED IT ON MY FACE! It was a disaster.  Burning, redness, heating up, breakouts, pores, all of the bad effects you could ever imagine, happened to me. So I stopped using it on my face, like other people suggest, it might work well on your body, SO I TRIED IT ON MY BODY!!! what was wrong with me. It couldn&#x27;t be washed off. All of the black stuff washed off, but when you carefully rub on your skin, it has this oily layer residues  from the mask. So the whole body was covered with this oily residue layer. So I had to shower again, and rub all them off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s your decision....</li>
            <li> I have looked high and low for a mud mask, and this one is the best I have found. So happy to have a friend recommend it. Love, love it.</li>
            <li> This product is suppose to be a purifying facial mask but it has a load of crap in it! Something like this should not have chemicals in them known to do harm! I would suggest you stay away! And the problem is not just the artificial fragrance its all the other ingredients!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve used other masks but feel this one really pulls the impurities out and my skin is so soft after.</li>
            <li> this leaves my skin feeling baby soft and looking beautiful.  I have eczema and very sensitive acne proned skin so i am very cautious with what i use but i wanted to give this a try and did small amounts at first then i slowly coverd my whole face and after months of use i love it.  a little goes a long way i havent even used 1/4 of the jar in 4 months of doing it weekly!  its a great product give it a try!</li>
            <li> Well got mine today and already use it and got inmediate results. Just checking the jar and is original product from Israel. Give a try to a wonderful product; sure will buy again.</li>
            <li> However a bit runny, plus to that is u use less.&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Made my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> It is the best I&#x27;ve tried so far..in the Western World..&lt;br /&gt;There would be a better one with more sulphur .. I&#x27;ve tried in the Eastern World.. must admit, on the premises..(not travelled) that beats it.  Wonder if that one could travel.</li>
            <li> This product is truly remarkable. large size container , used on arms and legs as well , spa day , I would recommend  this product to everyone ...  LOVE IT !!!</li>
            <li> When I got my product, it was soiled (due to defect in wrapping).  However, I contacted the vendor via email (on Saturday) informing of the soiled product, and by Monday I got a new replacement product...this time the product was not soiled.  Excellent customer service!&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I used the product, and unlike other facial masks, this one did not &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; my skin.  It was a cool and soothing mask, and my skin was noticeably brighter and subtle.  Most importantly, the mask did not dry out my skin.  Will purchase again when done.</li>
            <li> In love with this product, it made my skin look 10x better then what it did before, and it also made my skin super soft in just one use. I highly recommend this product, plus its much cheaper for the amount you get compared to all the other dead sea products</li>
            <li> I have sensitive combination skin....and my skin absolutely hates this stuff. The failed attempt with this actually made me buy stuff to make my own masks...so I love that I tried this....but I hate what it did to my face.</li>
            <li> I mean nothing change at all. It is just a mud which is fake and I&#x27;m sorry for saying that. But, this is the true.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for your skin and face.  Makes it nice and smooth and great to use. Will buy again</li>
            <li> This mask is nothing short of awesome. It goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t have an offensive odor and tightens up my pores nicely. One warning though- If you have done a peel or anything other than very gentle exfoliation within 24 hours before using, it will burn a bit. I think it contains salt and other minerals so that may be why. Other than that precautionary step, this is a great mask. It&#x27;s a BIG tub so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> i was very pleased with this item. it works well, clears blemishes almost with just one use, tingles a bit while dryng, you can feel it detoxing your face. the smell is nice, and you get a lot for your money, i would buy again</li>
            <li> This product really is great ! I love it ! Clears you&#x27;re skin totally worth the buy</li>
            <li> This makes my skin so soft and clear!! I didnt think it would work this well but Im so glad it did!</li>
            <li> Feels great when it comes off. Leaves my skin smooth! I would buy this again. Though, I would also say to get the facial brushes to put it on. Helps not make a mess and keeps it really formed and even.</li>
            <li> I received this only a few days ago, but after the first use I must say I have noticed a difference in my skin. The texture is slightly watery but it makes it go on smoother. When it arrived it was in perfect condition and I got it days before I was supposed too. So far, I&#x27;m really happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I received this item quickly without any issues. Not sure if the product itself is great just yet as I just began using it.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and have trouble finding masks that don&#x27;t burn when applied. I have tried multiple brands before risking this one. I&#x27;m glad I did. I won&#x27;t go back to the masks that I have tried before that leave my skin in worse condition than before. I recommend this product for anyone with sensitive skin that is also prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li> I love this product. The shipping was fast, the product goes on smooth and washes off so easy.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and gorgeous</li>
            <li> I tend to get clogged pores.  I use this mask twice a week, and see great improvements in breakouts.  This is not a good product for someone who has a lot of dry or open places on their face.  I had some wind and sunburn last weekend, and boy did it BURN when I went to do my usual regimen!!  Just beware of that.&lt;br /&gt;In addition to using a dead sea mud soap for cleansing daily with a buff puff exfoliater, using this product a couple of times a week has really seemed to help purify my skin and keep it healthier.</li>
            <li> I love this mask, it cleans my face really well. After washing the mud off, my face is more brighter and softer. Will buy more of this mud mask</li>
