            <li>they are great</li>
            <li>Otherwise a really great product for the price which you cannot beat anywhere.</li>
            <li>And the price is amazing for 10 of them!</li>
            <li>love them....soft and wonderful....</li>
            <li>I have name brand brushes and these are almost as good.</li>
            <li>Good quilty face brushes...they come with a smell but not unpleseant, and after couple time of using they shed 1 or 3 hairs though i didnt wash them yet</li>

            <li>I love these brushes!</li>
            <li>These leave a flawless beautiful finish that I can&#x27;t get enough of!</li>
            <li>These brushes feel amazing on skin.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying that I own A LOT of brushes.....</li>
            <li>honestly cannot beat the price for this set of brushes.</li>
            <li>The kabuki brushed apply foundation flawlessly and the tapered kabuki is great for under eye concealer.</li>
            <li>I received the items nicely packaged and shipped immediately.</li>
            <li>Not as dense as Sigma, but they are easier to control and leave a more airbrushed look.</li>
            <li>These are okay.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this brush set</li>
            <li>Third, they just feel so great!</li>
            <li>Brushes are ok but should be sold with a case or something to store them in</li>
            <li>These brushes are fantastic!</li>
            <li>And the seller is very nice they&#x27;re very helpful if you needed to track your item.</li>
            <li>Very soft great for concealer</li>
            <li>The brushes are really nice, I used them for the first time on today.</li>
            <li>but I imagine they&#x27;ll function fine.</li>
            <li>More than worth it</li>
            <li>Very nice brushes for a very low price.</li>
            <li>These brushes are super soft and they don&#x27;t shed at all, they&#x27;re a really good buy.</li>
            <li>They apply makeup really well and clean very easy.</li>
            <li>First of all, they&#x27;re cheap.  </li>
            <li>These brushes are WORTH IT.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll purchase more in the future!</li>
            <li>sure enough these were the source!</li>
            <li>this is the first time i brought brushes from amazon and they didnt shed</li>
            <li>Im really in love with the facial brushes they blend pretty well</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed in this purchase!</li>
            <li>Very soft and useful for all my makeup needs.</li>
            <li>The eye brushes are decent for the price!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these brushes!</li>
            <li>They are so soft and look exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>I ordered other items as well as the brushes, and the whole package all of my items came in reeked of strong spray paint stench, and</li>
            <li>The brushes have different thicknesses (some are softer than others), so they&#x27;re super versatile.  </li>
            <li>Overall these brushes are super soft.</li>
            <li>They came with a pretty off-putting odor, but it has significantly subsided after being washed and left out to air dry.</li>
            <li>Even came in a day early!</li>
            <li>These are great if your just starting with make up and dont want to spend so much on expensive brand.</li>
            <li>and all are so soft.</li>
            <li>The bristles are incredibly soft and barely shed.</li>
            <li>Not your ordinary cheap bristle brushes at all.</li>
            <li>though these are SUPER inexpensive compared to the higher end stuff, I use these bad boys on a daily basis and rarely need to pick others for my face.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend so much money for the same this brushes with other company</li>
            <li>Its Worth it for such a small price.</li>

            <li> Its Worth it for such a small price.</li>
            <li> Could have been 5 stars if these brushes been a little larger.  </li>
            <li> The only con I have about them is that they are a little flimsy</li>
            <li> I use the flat brush to apply foundation, one of the smaller brushes for concealer, another to blend my blush and bronzer, and the other small ones for eye shadow.  </li>
            <li> I ended up giving them to my daughter and ordering me other ones.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only had them for a few days now!</li>
            <li> they were slightly softer.</li>
            <li> They has a slight smell I just washed and dryed them and</li>
            <li> brushes were so stiff it was ridiculous actually hurt my skin.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not a problem because I would rather flimsy than hard or scratchy.</li>
            <li> Second, the hairs aren&#x27;t falling out (you know how annoying it is when you&#x27;re applying your makeup and leave stray hairs across your face).  </li>
            <li> had to let them sit outside for a few hours to kill the awful smell, and then I got the chance to use them, which was as bad as expected!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my handle of so a of the brushes fell off.</li>
            <li> The brushes grab hold of pigments, powders, and shadows like crazy.</li>
            <li> Brushes are awful quality!</li>

            <li> Very soft great for concealer</li>
            <li> Best brushes. I didn&#x27;t want to spend so much money for the same this brushes with other company so I decided to give it a try! Love themmmm! Best purchsed!

            <li> Let me start by saying that I own A LOT of brushes.....sigh.... A LOT (MAC, Sephora, UD, Sigma, Dior, Chanel... on and on) and though these are SUPER inexpensive compared to the higher end stuff, I use these bad boys on a daily basis and rarely need to pick others for my face. They do shed, but it&#x27;s tolerable. These leave a flawless beautiful finish that I can&#x27;t get enough of! Not as dense as Sigma, but they are easier to control and leave a more airbrushed look. LOVE!</li>

I have name brand brushes and these are almost as good.</li>
            <li> they  showed up sooner then I was told they would,  they are great and I feel like a pro using them  they are so beautiful and well crafted</li>
            <li> These are okay. Unfortunately my handle of so a of the brushes fell off. I ended up giving them to my daughter and ordering me other ones.</li>

            <li> These brushes are WORTH IT.  First of all, they&#x27;re cheap.  Second, the hairs aren&#x27;t falling out (you know how annoying it is when you&#x27;re applying your makeup and leave stray hairs across your face).  Third, they just feel so great! They hold onto my make up well.  I use the flat brush to apply foundation, one of the smaller brushes for concealer, another to blend my blush and bronzer, and the other small ones for eye shadow.  The brushes have different thicknesses (some are softer than others), so they&#x27;re super versatile.  I highly recommend these brushes!</li>

            <li> Great quality brushes! Even came in a day early! More than worth it</li>
            <li> I just got my brushes i order them on Sunday and they arrive on Wednesday. They has a slight smell I just washed and dryed them and they no liner smell. They didn&#x27;t shed or fall apart.  I must say I am in ❤️❤️.</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed in this purchase! Maybe after three uses of them they fell apart! You buy what you get!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes! They are so soft and look exactly like the picture. Very nice brushes for a very low price. I definitely recommend them!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! Very soft and useful for all my makeup needs. Awesome product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these brushes for about 2 days now....love them....soft and wonderful....</li>
            <li> Not as dense as I had hoped for with regard to the face brushes. The eye brushes are decent for the price!</li>
