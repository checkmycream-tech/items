            <li>Happy Amazon shopper w good looking eyeshadow! :)</li>
            <li>Oh and its also very good makeup as well :)</li>
            <li>Should use a good eyeshadow brush to blend the colors.</li>
            <li>It is a good value for the money.  </li>
            <li>I like brown colors and these are really good.  </li>
            <li>Also good for the makeup novice as it comes with suggestions on where to place each shade.  </li>

            <li>The price is fairly good.</li>

            <li>Good product and as described.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Maybelline for years and loved finding this on Amazon at a fair price.</li>
            <li>Need a good eye primmer to make colors pop.  </li>
            <li>It helps to make eyes more beautiful.</li>
            <li>I did however LOVE LOVE LOVE the colors!!!</li>
            <li>Happily grateful. :-)</li>
            <li>I have now grown to love makeup and the palette is great for starters.</li>
            <li>I love the colors and it is a great price.</li>
            <li>Great Product, I love the color and it has a goog explanation of how to use it....</li>
            <li>I love the colors in this eye make-up!  </li>
            <li>I love these colors!</li>
            <li>This one is pretty darn perfect.  </li>
            <li>Basically I just love it!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite eyeshadow!</li>
            <li>:) :P</li>
            <li>LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this quad!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and achieve great color/ shading with the four panels.</li>
            <li>I used the applicator brush that came with the package as well as my own brushes and still nothing.  </li>
            <li>I liked the colors</li>
            <li>Gorgeous colours :)</li>
            <li>It has a nice shimmer to it as well.</li>
            <li>Nice neutral shadow shades.</li>
            <li>Best color in here.&lt;br /&gt;Liner - wants to be a lighter shade of Mac “Notoriety” (from Leopard Luxe palette).</li>
            <li>This eye shadow is beautiful and fun to wear.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and stays there looking good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more when I run out! :)</li>
            <li>its very pretty I love it ! !</li>
            <li>The colors were just as beautiful as when it was first applied.</li>
            <li>naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of Maybelline&#x27;s greatest assets in amplifying this product is the fact that there is a clear distinction and description of where to place the make-up on the eyelid.  </li>
            <li>– warm bronze; performs better than you might expect.</li>
            <li>Love love love this!</li>
            <li>very easy to use and good one to have it in your bag, very compact and hassle free, the shades are good</li>
            <li>I used these colors and love them.</li>
            <li>Love the color&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Love the colors and they stay on well.</li>
            <li>and I love the brown shadow for my eyeliner as well.</li>
            <li>but I love it for a night out.</li>
            <li>that makes it show up more.  </li>
            <li>I plan to buy more because with my luck it will get discontinued</li>
            <li>I do love the colors though, so that is why I am giving this 3 stars.</li>
            <li>This is an especially  nice set of colors for blue eyes.  </li>
            <li>I love the neutral colors though.</li>
            <li>I felt in love with this eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>you can buy it, you are gonna love it.</li>
            <li>i love the colors</li>
            <li>So perfect to buy something online and have it  be the same as it was shown.</li>
            <li>I love the instruction on the make-up too.</li>
            <li>but I am no longer able to take it with me as it will be damaged in my purse.</li>
            <li>this is great for smokey eyes or just wanting a nice soft color.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Great every day make up. :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just okay.  </li>
            <li>free to ask any questions regarding the product or my review and leave me feedback !&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>I love these colors together.</li>
            <li>I fell in love from then.</li>
            <li>I just wish there were more color palettes to chose from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I wish there were more colors to chose from&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This could have been packaged better....</li>
            <li>love these shades...</li>
            <li>Love the colors and they stay on well.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I set the liner on my top lashline</li>
            <li>colors in the Maybelline color quads are very rich and robust without looking garish.</li>
            <li>I think this eyeshadow pallet is pretty good, and it stays on well.</li>
            <li>– looks light/shimmery, but it’s not bad once it’s on&lt;br /&gt;Crease – warm taupe.</li>
            <li>Not only does this product nicely match the hues within the color selection, but it also highlights the right color eyes perfectly!  </li>
            <li>so i was excited to see that i got two of them!</li>
            <li>Cute colors, and easy to put on.</li>
            <li>This is a very good eye shadow quad especially for the price</li>
            <li>The colors are so bright and vibrant!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not only a good price but also good quality, highly pigmented, and a good color combination.</li>
            <li>Great natural colored eyeshadow pack.</li>
            <li>like the tall color looks like a really light sand, but its really more like a peach color.</li>
            <li>(he likes the natural beauty thing) and even he thought it looked great.</li>
            <li>i was very happy when i got this, i was not aware that it came as a 2 pack</li>
            <li>, I can take it with me anywhere easily.</li>
            <li>Amazon made the correction easy and the representative I chatted</li>
            <li>The colors are highly pigmented and gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>Ladies, this is really good stuff, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I love the earth tones, they suit me well; however, It would have been good if No. 2 compartment was a bit bigger, as I have to use more as that is the largest surface area.</li>
            <li>Pretty nice.</li>
            <li>The dark brown looks great for a smoky effect and you can very easily go for a more neutral or bold look depending on the combination and how many layers you use.  </li>
            <li>Amazing for a natural look!!!!</li>
            <li>and they arrived quickly as well!</li>
            <li>came fast!! :)</li>
            <li>My boyfriend is a huge critic when it comes to make-up</li>
            <li>Makes a fantastic neutral smokey eye</li>
            <li>I like to use these at work or for traveling light  </li>
            <li>But I use a light colored primer underneath</li>
            <li>If you have light skin</li>
            <li>overall, a great product.</li>
            <li>Maybelline has fantastic palettes.</li>
            <li>Cheap beginners make up alternative</li>
            <li>you are unsure of how to apply the product detailed instructions are available on the back&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;-the palette really looks nice once you get the hang of it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Done right, this make-up can look as if the most priciest eye shadow is on your eyelid.  </li>
            <li>The top right color is a bit orange</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for long lasting wear, and it adds a great sparkle for day to night looks in just minutes...</li>
            <li>so this was a good value for me to replace my favorite daily products with nice new clean make up.</li>
            <li>Another feature I really liked about this set, is that it labels on each color square where at to use that particular color on your eye.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this product because it has become my new favorite</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow itself is great, and long wearing.  </li>
            <li>I wish the crease color stayed on a bit better, but it&#x27;s great for everyday wear</li>
            <li>very glitzy, very glittery, and stays on surprisingly well.</li>
            <li>The colors are gorgeous, pretty natural and are very nice for daily make-up.</li>
            <li>I asked if I could just get a replacement and Amazon sent me a replacement SUPER FAST!!!</li>
            <li>Only one color (Bronze at the top right corner) has a lot of shimmer to it, so that&#x27;s the color I play with most to make it more of an evening look.</li>
            <li>Chai latte is a very good everyday eyeshadow for work or school.</li>
            <li>This quad has great colors, but not much pigment.</li>
            <li>So to summarize, not quite up to par with Urban Decay, but surprisingly comparable.</li>
            <li>That made it an extra good deal.</li>
            <li>Real product is more orange.</li>
            <li>but I really like the shimmer on top.</li>
            <li>Not bad for what it is.</li>
            <li>It goes on great and doesn&#x27;t crease on your eyelids like other eye shadows.</li>
            <li>Came quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li>Not only does the color scheme fit nicely, but blended together, the shades dramatically illustrate the eyelid and eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am an African American caramel cutie and this worked great for my skin tone : )</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty</li>
            <li>its natural and so pretty, i have gotten many compliments on it!</li>
            <li>This was the answer, now I have a new favorite...</li>
            <li>It really brings out my blue-green eyes and is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>This little set looks great at a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li>It has very neutral colors which can be used lightly and are still build-able.</li>
            <li>Great everyday quad.  </li>
            <li>My favorite eye shadow quad by far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, even though it is nice to have each square labeled, my compact was labeled by being written in the actual make-up.  </li>
            <li>The colors are quite a bit darker than anticipated, I had to wipe most of it off to get the soft color I was going for.</li>
            <li>Often you get one and you only like one or two colors, but I liked them all.</li>
            <li>Mocha Motion and Stylish Smokes 02Q Natural Smokes).</li>
            <li>Good for a few hours wear perhaps at night, goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>The pigment in this shadow is good--not as good as Smashbox or LARS, but it&#x27;s far better than any of the other brands I find in the makeup aisle at Walmart or Target.  </li>
            <li>the ordering process on the other hand wasn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li>but I use a MAC for that color-all the other colors are good.  ^_^</li>
            <li>The colors might look good on other women.  </li>
            <li>On line the picture looked more rose colored, it is hard to tell by the picture.</li>
            <li>I think this is the first eyeshadow quad that I&#x27;ve known right away</li>
            <li>The instructions are helpful too--they walk you right through the first application.  </li>
            <li>I thought Maybelline typically had really good makeup</li>
            <li>The gold is a very bronzey gold and super shimmery.  </li>
            <li>Good if you are on a budget and want something different, are just starting out in makeup, feel like purchasing something at the drugstore (without high expectations), or need a cheap palette to keep at bf/sister/whoever’s.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely one of the better eye shadows out there</li>
            <li>The shade was exactly what I expexted.</li>
            <li>Exactly like buying it in the store.</li>
            <li>It is so pretty.</li>
            <li>Give it a try, and I guarantee you will go back for more.</li>
            <li>The first time I thought it might be a coincidence, but now I got them again, one day after using the eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>but I really like it!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>small simple with wonderful results</li>
            <li>I purchased this eyeshadow years ago when I first started wearing makeup.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please be aware there are sparkles in the highlighting color</li>
            <li>I never wear several layers of eyeshadow and blend well and even apply a top layer of powder over my shadow to help keep it in place, but this stuff never stays put.</li>
            <li>I really like the colors!</li>
            <li>They just look so pretty</li>
            <li>There is not a lot of dimension, but the variation is enough to make it interesting.</li>
            <li>I recommend that before you decide to wear this eyeshadow out anywhere that you experiment with it at home first.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it is beautiful and I will definitely be buying another one.</li>
            <li>However, when I came home from work more than nine hours later and caught a glimpse of myself in a mirror, I was really sold.</li>
            <li>I searched high and low for my favorite discontinued pallette...</li>
            <li>w was professional and super helpful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been dropped several times and stays together and strong.</li>
            <li>I don’t think they’re strong enough to stand alone.</li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for and didn&#x27;t feel like shopping in-store with a new baby, so this worked!</li>
            <li>This is a great little compact, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this product to create a much darker brown smokey eye than the pictures show.</li>
            <li>Very gold, excelent price</li>
            <li>I find that there isn&#x27;t much pigment</li>
            <li>I know that some labels ended up with the descriptions on the back, and hopefully Maybelline caught on that this was the best way to go for those who had trouble applying the make-up to different areas of the eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Depending on whether it&#x27;s for day or night, you can apply these colors in different ways and get a fantastic look.</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t really like the lid color (color 2)</li>
            <li>, it appears really orange on my skin.</li>
            <li>This should come off much richer and does not.</li>
            <li>Then you try them and they’re unimpressive and you don’t do much with them until you dedicate yourself to using them</li>
            <li>I liked having the descriptions in the make-up, but after a few uses the writing was blended away.  </li>
            <li>I love the colors and they work well with my dark complexion but after the first use the attachment that hold the cover on broke in one corner and the cover no longer stay on.</li>
            <li>It created a soft bronze eye, nice for summer or any other time.</li>
            <li>I was super excited about this set of colors because I adore nude/natural colors but also like dark browns and beige&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping for thicker/heavier/more vibrant application.  </li>
            <li>The main thing I don&#x27;t like is how much sparkle even the matte-looking colors have in them.</li>
            <li>Way too dark for my skin and the colors clashed, it would probably work better for people with darker skin.</li>
            <li>My eyes are really sensitive - I have had reactions numerous times to different eye shadows--from the super cheap stuff at the grocery store to department store brands that blow my budget.  </li>
            <li>My favorite is still the urban decay naked palette</li>
            <li>My friend who has a lot of makeup (including department store brands) highly recommended this one to me.</li>
            <li>Love that I can make the very dark color</li>
            <li>I very much recommend this product, not only because of the beautiful hues within the make-up, but for the long lasting shades, and the high quality of make-up for the low cost of the total compact.</li>
            <li>Love these colors for everyday looks and even for smoky night out looks.</li>
            <li>This set has everything you need for a simple lid to a fun night out.</li>
            <li>This product caught my eye a few weeks before I bought it, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I think this quad is a good quality, not great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am so excited by my purchase of Maybelline New York Expert Wear Eyeshadow Chai Latte, that I absolutely will try other colors.</li>
            <li>New to me</li>
            <li>I highly recommend all eye colors to try this product, as the natural, beige, and latte mix tend to hit every skin tone and eye color</li>
            <li>This was actually the first eye shadow I  bought myself about three or four years ago.</li>
            <li>Such an affordable price for a lovely little kit.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased Urban Decay&#x27;s wildly popular Naked 2 pallet and while I love that product, it is expensive.  </li>
            <li>Clearly, I would not advise anyone to use this product.</li>
            <li>The colors are nearly translucent.  </li>
            <li>I like natural colors when choosing make up</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this eye shadow.  </li>
            <li>they looked so natural and had some shine to them as well.</li>
            <li>DEFINITELY use it with primer if you want the colors to really pop.</li>
            <li>and I would prefer a natural color palette to something pastel or neon any day.</li>
            <li>It is marked also to show you where each color should go.</li>
            <li>But for the sake of this review, I used Chai Latte – all the colors, together for a complete eye look.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I really like the combination together, i was  having difficulty finding browns that were soft, wears very well, complements my dark skin tone.</li>
            <li>Love the colors and the subtle hints of shimmer.</li>
            <li>I am aware that some people get eyelid bumps for other reasons, but I had got them twice in my entire life - both of these times after using this particular Maybelline NY eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>I simply throw out my make up once a year and buy new</li>
            <li>Was surprised there were two in the package, as I thought I was buying only one.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smudge, but will leave glittery dust on your cheeks if you&#x27;re not careful in the application</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the make-up itself, when blended correctly and applied generously, last a very long time, with a high quality look.  </li>
            <li>This little thing of eye makeup changed my whole makeup routine!</li>
            <li>Not bad, but its hard to keep the shadow just on the lids.</li>
            <li>best if you do thick black eyeliner for a dramatic look.</li>
            <li>Worth the sale price, not more.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> For the price, this is totally amazing!</li>
            <li> love the gold shade, but it is too sparkly to wear during the day -- although it&#x27;s great for date night!!</li>

            <li> Happy Amazon shopper w good looking eyeshadow! :)</li>
            <li> Oh and its also very good makeup as well :)</li>
            <li> Should use a good eyeshadow brush to blend the colors.</li>
            <li> It is a good value for the money.  </li>
            <li> I like brown colors and these are really good.  </li>
            <li> Also good for the makeup novice as it comes with suggestions on where to place each shade.  </li>

            <li> The price is fairly good.</li>

            <li> Good product and as described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Maybelline for years and loved finding this on Amazon at a fair price.</li>
            <li> Need a good eye primmer to make colors pop.  </li>
            <li> It helps to make eyes more beautiful.</li>

            <li> I love the colors and it is a great price.</li>
            <li> Great Product, I love the color and it has a goog explanation of how to use it....</li>
            <li> I love the colors in this eye make-up!  </li>
            <li> I love these colors!</li>

            <li> Basically I just love it!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eyeshadow!</li>
            <li> :) :P</li>
            <li> LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this quad!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and achieve great color/ shading with the four panels.</li>
            <li> I used the applicator brush that came with the package as well as my own brushes and still nothing.  </li>
            <li> I liked the colors</li>
            <li> Gorgeous colours :)</li>
            <li> It has a nice shimmer to it as well.</li>
            <li> Nice neutral shadow shades.</li>
            <li> Best color in here.&lt;br /&gt;Liner - wants to be a lighter shade of Mac “Notoriety” (from Leopard Luxe palette).</li>
            <li> This eye shadow is beautiful and fun to wear.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and stays there looking good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying more when I run out! :)</li>
            <li> its very pretty I love it ! !</li>
            <li> The colors were just as beautiful as when it was first applied.</li>
            <li> naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of Maybelline&#x27;s greatest assets in amplifying this product is the fact that there is a clear distinction and description of where to place the make-up on the eyelid.  </li>
            <li> – warm bronze; performs better than you might expect.</li>
            <li> Love love love this!</li>
            <li> very easy to use and good one to have it in your bag, very compact and hassle free, the shades are good</li>
            <li> I used these colors and love them.</li>
            <li> Love the color&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Love the colors and they stay on well.</li>
            <li> and I love the brown shadow for my eyeliner as well.</li>
            <li> but I love it for a night out.</li>
            <li> that makes it show up more.  </li>
            <li> I plan to buy more because with my luck it will get discontinued</li>
            <li> I do love the colors though, so that is why I am giving this 3 stars.</li>
            <li> This is an especially  nice set of colors for blue eyes.  </li>
            <li> I love the neutral colors though.</li>
            <li> I felt in love with this eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> you can buy it, you are gonna love it.</li>
            <li> i love the colors</li>
            <li> So perfect to buy something online and have it  be the same as it was shown.</li>
            <li> I love the instruction on the make-up too.</li>
            <li> but I am no longer able to take it with me as it will be damaged in my purse.</li>
            <li> this is great for smokey eyes or just wanting a nice soft color.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Great every day make up. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just okay.  </li>
            <li> free to ask any questions regarding the product or my review and leave me feedback !&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I love these colors together.</li>
            <li> I fell in love from then.</li>
            <li> I just wish there were more color palettes to chose from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I wish there were more colors to chose from&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This could have been packaged better....</li>
            <li> love these shades...</li>
            <li> Love the colors and they stay on well.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I set the liner on my top lashline</li>
            <li> colors in the Maybelline color quads are very rich and robust without looking garish.</li>
            <li> I think this eyeshadow pallet is pretty good, and it stays on well.</li>
            <li> – looks light/shimmery, but it’s not bad once it’s on&lt;br /&gt;Crease – warm taupe.</li>
            <li> Not only does this product nicely match the hues within the color selection, but it also highlights the right color eyes perfectly!  </li>
            <li> so i was excited to see that i got two of them!</li>
            <li> Cute colors, and easy to put on.</li>
            <li> This is a very good eye shadow quad especially for the price</li>
            <li> The colors are so bright and vibrant!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not only a good price but also good quality, highly pigmented, and a good color combination.</li>
            <li> Great natural colored eyeshadow pack.</li>
            <li> like the tall color looks like a really light sand, but its really more like a peach color.</li>
            <li> (he likes the natural beauty thing) and even he thought it looked great.</li>
            <li> i was very happy when i got this, i was not aware that it came as a 2 pack</li>
            <li> , I can take it with me anywhere easily.</li>
            <li> Amazon made the correction easy and the representative I chatted</li>
            <li> The colors are highly pigmented and gorgeous.  </li>
            <li> Ladies, this is really good stuff, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love the earth tones, they suit me well; however, It would have been good if No. 2 compartment was a bit bigger, as I have to use more as that is the largest surface area.</li>
            <li> Pretty nice.</li>
            <li> The dark brown looks great for a smoky effect and you can very easily go for a more neutral or bold look depending on the combination and how many layers you use.  </li>
            <li> Amazing for a natural look!!!!</li>
            <li> and they arrived quickly as well!</li>
            <li> came fast!! :)</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is a huge critic when it comes to make-up</li>
            <li> Makes a fantastic neutral smokey eye</li>
            <li> I like to use these at work or for traveling light  </li>
            <li> But I use a light colored primer underneath</li>
            <li> If you have light skin</li>
            <li> overall, a great product.</li>
            <li> Maybelline has fantastic palettes.</li>
            <li> Cheap beginners make up alternative</li>
            <li> you are unsure of how to apply the product detailed instructions are available on the back&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;-the palette really looks nice once you get the hang of it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Done right, this make-up can look as if the most priciest eye shadow is on your eyelid.  </li>
            <li> The top right color is a bit orange</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for long lasting wear, and it adds a great sparkle for day to night looks in just minutes...</li>
            <li> so this was a good value for me to replace my favorite daily products with nice new clean make up.</li>
            <li> Another feature I really liked about this set, is that it labels on each color square where at to use that particular color on your eye.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this product because it has become my new favorite</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow itself is great, and long wearing.  </li>
            <li> I wish the crease color stayed on a bit better, but it&#x27;s great for everyday wear</li>
            <li> very glitzy, very glittery, and stays on surprisingly well.</li>
            <li> The colors are gorgeous, pretty natural and are very nice for daily make-up.</li>
            <li> I asked if I could just get a replacement and Amazon sent me a replacement SUPER FAST!!!</li>
            <li> Only one color (Bronze at the top right corner) has a lot of shimmer to it, so that&#x27;s the color I play with most to make it more of an evening look.</li>
            <li> Chai latte is a very good everyday eyeshadow for work or school.</li>
            <li> This quad has great colors, but not much pigment.</li>
            <li> So to summarize, not quite up to par with Urban Decay, but surprisingly comparable.</li>
            <li> That made it an extra good deal.</li>
            <li> Real product is more orange.</li>
            <li> but I really like the shimmer on top.</li>
            <li> Not bad for what it is.</li>
            <li> It goes on great and doesn&#x27;t crease on your eyelids like other eye shadows.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li> Not only does the color scheme fit nicely, but blended together, the shades dramatically illustrate the eyelid and eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am an African American caramel cutie and this worked great for my skin tone : )</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pretty</li>
            <li> its natural and so pretty, i have gotten many compliments on it!</li>
            <li> This was the answer, now I have a new favorite...</li>
            <li> It really brings out my blue-green eyes and is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> This little set looks great at a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li> It has very neutral colors which can be used lightly and are still build-able.</li>
            <li> Great everyday quad.  </li>
            <li> My favorite eye shadow quad by far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, even though it is nice to have each square labeled, my compact was labeled by being written in the actual make-up.  </li>
            <li> The colors are quite a bit darker than anticipated, I had to wipe most of it off to get the soft color I was going for.</li>
            <li> Often you get one and you only like one or two colors, but I liked them all.</li>
            <li> Mocha Motion and Stylish Smokes 02Q Natural Smokes).</li>
            <li> Good for a few hours wear perhaps at night, goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> The pigment in this shadow is good--not as good as Smashbox or LARS, but it&#x27;s far better than any of the other brands I find in the makeup aisle at Walmart or Target.  </li>
            <li> the ordering process on the other hand wasn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li> but I use a MAC for that color-all the other colors are good.  ^_^</li>
            <li> The colors might look good on other women.  </li>
            <li> On line the picture looked more rose colored, it is hard to tell by the picture.</li>
            <li> I think this is the first eyeshadow quad that I&#x27;ve known right away</li>
            <li> The instructions are helpful too--they walk you right through the first application.  </li>
            <li> I thought Maybelline typically had really good makeup</li>
            <li> The gold is a very bronzey gold and super shimmery.  </li>
            <li> Good if you are on a budget and want something different, are just starting out in makeup, feel like purchasing something at the drugstore (without high expectations), or need a cheap palette to keep at bf/sister/whoever’s.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely one of the better eye shadows out there</li>
            <li> The shade was exactly what I expexted.</li>
            <li> Exactly like buying it in the store.</li>
            <li> It is so pretty.</li>
            <li> Give it a try, and I guarantee you will go back for more.</li>
            <li> The first time I thought it might be a coincidence, but now I got them again, one day after using the eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> but I really like it!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> small simple with wonderful results</li>
            <li> I purchased this eyeshadow years ago when I first started wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please be aware there are sparkles in the highlighting color</li>
            <li> I never wear several layers of eyeshadow and blend well and even apply a top layer of powder over my shadow to help keep it in place, but this stuff never stays put.</li>
            <li> I really like the colors!</li>
            <li> They just look so pretty</li>
            <li> There is not a lot of dimension, but the variation is enough to make it interesting.</li>
            <li> I recommend that before you decide to wear this eyeshadow out anywhere that you experiment with it at home first.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it is beautiful and I will definitely be buying another one.</li>
            <li> However, when I came home from work more than nine hours later and caught a glimpse of myself in a mirror, I was really sold.</li>
            <li> I searched high and low for my favorite discontinued pallette...</li>
            <li> w was professional and super helpful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been dropped several times and stays together and strong.</li>
            <li> I don’t think they’re strong enough to stand alone.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for and didn&#x27;t feel like shopping in-store with a new baby, so this worked!</li>
            <li> This is a great little compact, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this product to create a much darker brown smokey eye than the pictures show.</li>
            <li> Very gold, excelent price</li>
            <li> I find that there isn&#x27;t much pigment</li>
            <li> I know that some labels ended up with the descriptions on the back, and hopefully Maybelline caught on that this was the best way to go for those who had trouble applying the make-up to different areas of the eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Depending on whether it&#x27;s for day or night, you can apply these colors in different ways and get a fantastic look.</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t really like the lid color (color 2)</li>
            <li> , it appears really orange on my skin.</li>
            <li> This should come off much richer and does not.</li>
            <li> Then you try them and they’re unimpressive and you don’t do much with them until you dedicate yourself to using them</li>
            <li> I liked having the descriptions in the make-up, but after a few uses the writing was blended away.  </li>
            <li> I love the colors and they work well with my dark complexion but after the first use the attachment that hold the cover on broke in one corner and the cover no longer stay on.</li>
            <li> It created a soft bronze eye, nice for summer or any other time.</li>
            <li> I was super excited about this set of colors because I adore nude/natural colors but also like dark browns and beige&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping for thicker/heavier/more vibrant application.  </li>
            <li> The main thing I don&#x27;t like is how much sparkle even the matte-looking colors have in them.</li>
            <li> Way too dark for my skin and the colors clashed, it would probably work better for people with darker skin.</li>
            <li> My eyes are really sensitive - I have had reactions numerous times to different eye shadows--from the super cheap stuff at the grocery store to department store brands that blow my budget.  </li>
            <li> My favorite is still the urban decay naked palette</li>
            <li> My friend who has a lot of makeup (including department store brands) highly recommended this one to me.</li>
            <li> Love that I can make the very dark color</li>
            <li> I very much recommend this product, not only because of the beautiful hues within the make-up, but for the long lasting shades, and the high quality of make-up for the low cost of the total compact.</li>
            <li> Love these colors for everyday looks and even for smoky night out looks.</li>
            <li> This set has everything you need for a simple lid to a fun night out.</li>
            <li> This product caught my eye a few weeks before I bought it, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I think this quad is a good quality, not great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am so excited by my purchase of Maybelline New York Expert Wear Eyeshadow Chai Latte, that I absolutely will try other colors.</li>
            <li> New to me</li>
            <li> I highly recommend all eye colors to try this product, as the natural, beige, and latte mix tend to hit every skin tone and eye color</li>
            <li> This was actually the first eye shadow I  bought myself about three or four years ago.</li>
            <li> Such an affordable price for a lovely little kit.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased Urban Decay&#x27;s wildly popular Naked 2 pallet and while I love that product, it is expensive.  </li>
            <li> Clearly, I would not advise anyone to use this product.</li>
            <li> The colors are nearly translucent.  </li>
            <li> I like natural colors when choosing make up</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this eye shadow.  </li>
            <li> they looked so natural and had some shine to them as well.</li>
            <li> DEFINITELY use it with primer if you want the colors to really pop.</li>
            <li> and I would prefer a natural color palette to something pastel or neon any day.</li>
            <li> It is marked also to show you where each color should go.</li>
            <li> But for the sake of this review, I used Chai Latte – all the colors, together for a complete eye look.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I really like the combination together, i was  having difficulty finding browns that were soft, wears very well, complements my dark skin tone.</li>
            <li> Love the colors and the subtle hints of shimmer.</li>
            <li> I am aware that some people get eyelid bumps for other reasons, but I had got them twice in my entire life - both of these times after using this particular Maybelline NY eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> I simply throw out my make up once a year and buy new</li>
            <li> Was surprised there were two in the package, as I thought I was buying only one.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smudge, but will leave glittery dust on your cheeks if you&#x27;re not careful in the application</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the make-up itself, when blended correctly and applied generously, last a very long time, with a high quality look.  </li>
            <li> This little thing of eye makeup changed my whole makeup routine!</li>
            <li> Not bad, but its hard to keep the shadow just on the lids.</li>
            <li> best if you do thick black eyeliner for a dramatic look.</li>
            <li> Worth the sale price, not more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to switch up which one would be your base or liner, depending on what look you like.</li>
            <li> As long as your wear a eyeshadow primer before putting it on it will last all day.</li>
            <li> * For an everyday summer look try the Maybelline New York Chai Latte or Sunlit Bronze</li>
            <li> and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> They stay all day long</li>
            <li> I would recommend for every day and doesn&#x27;t take too long to apply.</li>
            <li> , so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a complete waste.</li>
            <li> and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> But typically, lighter colors barely show up.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t understand the sample images provided by the merchant (as of writing), they all look like they&#x27;re wearing a single layer of greyish-blue eyeshadow...</li>
            <li> To be fair, I do not use a eyeshadow primer or base, but I refuse to buy those when my other eye makeup does not require it.</li>
            <li> The big chunks of glitter tend to fall down onto my face over the course of a day.</li>
            <li> The item is exactly as it shows, the golden shade is sparkling and indicates which one is the base, to the shade the eyelid and for the liner</li>
            <li> the only thing is that the makeup was opened &amp; it didnt come with any little brush it looked a bit used</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how long wearing this is, because I tend to wear it only in the evening.</li>
            <li> All as expected</li>
            <li> I like the colors in this quad, however the colors are not very pigmented so you do have to layer quite a bit.</li>
            <li> This product is as expected.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a bit of fall out, but that was expected for the price.</li>
            <li> The base color kind of gets lost on my skin tone</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;crease&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;lid&amp;#34; colors are very pigmented though and CAN give you a dramatic look if you desire.</li>
            <li> The dark brown can double as a liner if you don&#x27;t want a harsh line of a pencil.</li>
            <li> I do like the other 3 colors though</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this palette isn&#x27;t very pigmented so the shadows don&#x27;t stick to my skin like they should.</li>
            <li> The colors work well together and feel less powdery than the other palettes previously mentioned.</li>
            <li> I originally ordered this product and it arrived in poor condition: busted up container, missing one application wand,  broken shadows.</li>
            <li> The colors stay on for a long time and I hardly had any fall out.</li>
            <li> Colors allow just a hint of shadow or dark smoky look, depending on your needs!</li>
            <li> You can wear just one for a little sparkle or blend a a little contrast..</li>
            <li> A little shimmer.</li>
            <li> A little sparkle.</li>
            <li> I like the little bit of sparkle in the color.</li>
            <li> The base is the most important step for my eyes because I have dark lids, unfortunately this base did not have enough pigment to work for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday</li>
            <li> It almost looks like no color at all on my pale skin.  </li>
            <li> Too bad the lid color is just too orange and makes me look funny.</li>
            <li> I usually wear browns and plums.</li>
            <li> I only got one brush in mine and it was opened when I got it so that&#x27;s a fail.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually put on eye shadow, but this one is one that I&#x27;ve been using for a while now.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s a small case</li>
            <li> A humid day that usually encourages the oil on my skin to flow didn&#x27;t even budge it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As would be expected, the little sponge brushes that are included are totally useless, but I use shadow brushes anyway.  </li>
            <li> The applicators are not very good though.</li>
            <li> You can do a subtle daytime look or a smokey evening look depending on how you use the colors.  </li>
            <li> Even the liner portion has a bit of sparkle, so it&#x27;s not good for daytime wear.</li>
            <li> It even has a photo on the back with directions on where to apply the crease, lid, corner, and base colors.</li>
            <li> Learn how to use it beforehand so that you don&#x27;t feel insecure wearing it to go out.</li>
            <li> Note that the base color is VERY subtle.  </li>
            <li> But the brushes are of bad quality.</li>
            <li> The base color basically doesn&#x27;t show up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used these colors and love them. I usually wear browns and plums. This group is perfect. And i like shimmer and sparkle. Came quickly and packaged well. Buy great colors. Buy.  Peace</li>
            <li> Love the color&#x27;s it looks great with my brown eyes. I only got one brush in mine and it was opened when I got it so that&#x27;s a fail.</li>
            <li> Love the colors and they stay on well. Great price and lasts a long time. The color did not smear and stayed on all day.</li>
            <li> I love the colors in this eye make-up!  It really brings out my blue-green eyes and is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> My friend who has a lot of makeup (including department store brands) highly recommended this one to me. She uses it a lot. It&#x27;s not only a good price but also good quality, highly pigmented, and a good color combination. It even has a photo on the back with directions on where to apply the crease, lid, corner, and base colors. The applicators are not very good though. Should use a good eyeshadow brush to blend the colors.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually put on eye shadow, but this one is one that I&#x27;ve been using for a while now. It&#x27;s definitely one of the better eye shadows out there</li>
            <li> Such an affordable price for a lovely little kit. Love these colors for everyday looks and even for smoky night out looks. Happily grateful. :-)</li>
            <li> I thought Maybelline typically had really good makeup so I didn&#x27;t have any qualms about ordering this.  Unfortunately this palette isn&#x27;t very pigmented so the shadows don&#x27;t stick to my skin like they should. The colors are nearly translucent.  I used the applicator brush that came with the package as well as my own brushes and still nothing.  I was really hoping for thicker/heavier/more vibrant application.  I&#x27;m very disappointed :(</li>
            <li> There is nothing about this pallet I do not like. Makes a fantastic neutral smokey eye and I love the brown shadow for my eyeliner as well.</li>
            <li> Great natural colored eyeshadow pack. Excellent value for the price. They provide medium pigment that stays all day. Colors allow just a hint of shadow or dark smoky look, depending on your needs!</li>
            <li> I use this brand all the time.  It is a good value for the money.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a perfect pallet for creating the smokey eye shadow look. I don&#x27;t use it everyday but I love it for a night out. Thumbs up.</li>
            <li> * For an everyday summer look try the Maybelline New York Chai Latte or Sunlit Bronze quad shadows  * I like to use these at work or for traveling light  * A great find for the price</li>
            <li> I love these colors! I will be taking them as my only eye make-up on my vacation in a week</li>
            <li> The colors are so bright and vibrant! They stay all day long and they arrived quickly as well! A must have quad!</li>
            <li> I use this every day. It goes on great and doesn&#x27;t crease on your eyelids like other eye shadows. I like natural colors when choosing make up and this was perfect for me! I will definitely be buying this again</li>
            <li> I wear this eyeshadow every day!  I found a review of it on youtube and decided to give it a try.  You can do a subtle daytime look or a smokey evening look depending on how you use the colors.  Note that the base color is VERY subtle.  It almost looks like no color at all on my pale skin.  But I use a light colored primer underneath that makes it show up more.  I would definitely recommend this.  I plan to buy more because with my luck it will get discontinued so I think I&#x27;ll stock up!</li>
            <li> This quad has great colors, but not much pigment. The base is the most important step for my eyes because I have dark lids, unfortunately this base did not have enough pigment to work for me. I do love the colors though, so that is why I am giving this 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I like brown colors and these are really good.  They should offer cream foundation to match with the eye shows.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this eye shadow.  I recently purchased Urban Decay&#x27;s wildly popular Naked 2 pallet and while I love that product, it is expensive.  This little set looks great at a fraction of the price.  The colors are highly pigmented and gorgeous.  This is an especially  nice set of colors for blue eyes.  Also good for the makeup novice as it comes with suggestions on where to place each shade.  So to summarize, not quite up to par with Urban Decay, but surprisingly comparable.</li>
            <li> I liked the colors b/c they looked so natural and had some shine to them as well. I would recommend for every day and doesn&#x27;t take too long to apply.</li>
            <li> With maybelline eyeshadows, you never know what you&#x27;ll get in terms of pigmentation. But typically, lighter colors barely show up. With this quad, this is the case with the lightest &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; shadow. Also, the sparkly brown one isn&#x27;t that pigmented either.  The &amp;#34;crease&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;lid&amp;#34; colors are very pigmented though and CAN give you a dramatic look if you desire.</li>
            <li> Way too dark for my skin and the colors clashed, it would probably work better for people with darker skin. If you have light skin I suggest you do not buy this product. I am giving it 3 stars because for some people &amp;#34;it could&amp;#34; have potential. This product is definitely not for me!</li>
            <li> The colors are gorgeous, pretty natural and are very nice for daily make-up. Also it&#x27;s a small case, I can take it with me anywhere easily. My favorite eye shadow quad by far.</li>
            <li> DEFINITELY use it with primer if you want the colors to really pop. I use this product to create a much darker brown smokey eye than the pictures show.</li>
            <li> Best choice and best price. All as expected</li>
            <li> This is great!  Got this on time and am very pleased!</li>
            <li> Very gold, excelent price</li>
            <li> I like to wear shades of brown eye shadow. This is a great little compact, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the gold shade, but it is too sparkly to wear during the day -- although it&#x27;s great for date night!! Even the liner portion has a bit of sparkle, so it&#x27;s not good for daytime wear. But again, wonderful for night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how long wearing this is, because I tend to wear it only in the evening.</li>
            <li> I wish the crease color stayed on a bit better, but it&#x27;s great for everyday wear and I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I think this quad is a good quality, not great. I find that there isn&#x27;t much pigment and it takes quite a bit of layering for it to show up on the eyes. I love the neutral colors though.</li>
            <li> I love the earth tones, they suit me well; however, It would have been good if No. 2 compartment was a bit bigger, as I have to use more as that is the largest surface area.</li>
            <li> I searched high and low for my favorite discontinued pallette... This was the answer, now I have a new favorite... It&#x27;s great for long lasting wear, and it adds a great sparkle for day to night looks in just minutes... You can wear just one for a little sparkle or blend a a little contrast.. I am an African American caramel cutie and this worked great for my skin tone : )</li>
            <li> great product!!!!!!!!! came fast!! :)</li>
            <li> The shade was exactly what I expexted. It arrived on time. I use it often. Exactly like buying it in the store.</li>
            <li> This eye shadow is beautiful and fun to wear. It goes on easily and stays there looking good. It is so pretty.</li>
            <li> The item is exactly as it shows, the golden shade is sparkling and indicates which one is the base, to the shade the eyelid and for the liner</li>
            <li> I like the colors in this quad, however the colors are not very pigmented so you do have to layer quite a bit. The main thing I don&#x27;t like is how much sparkle even the matte-looking colors have in them. The big chunks of glitter tend to fall down onto my face over the course of a day.</li>
            <li> Just perfect!!! I felt in love with this eyeshadow. They make your eyes look stunning!!! Girls you can buy it, you are gonna love it.</li>
            <li> I knew that I loved this make-up as soon as I put it on. The colors were vibrant, complimented my hazel/brown eyes and looked dynamite with my kohl black eye liner. However, when I came home from work more than nine hours later and caught a glimpse of myself in a mirror, I was really sold. The colors were just as beautiful as when it was first applied. A humid day that usually encourages the oil on my skin to flow didn&#x27;t even budge it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so excited by my purchase of Maybelline New York Expert Wear Eyeshadow Chai Latte, that I absolutely will try other colors. Ladies, this is really good stuff, and I highly recommend it. For the price, this is totally amazing! Give it a try, and I guarantee you will go back for more.</li>
            <li> GREAT COLORS GREAT PIGMENT!</li>
            <li> this eye shadow works great. its one of my favorites. the ordering process on the other hand wasn&#x27;t good. it took forever to get here and got lost in the mail and was sent back to sender. after emailing them a million times I finally got it.</li>
            <li> perfect shades. exactly what I was looking for and didn&#x27;t feel like shopping in-store with a new baby, so this worked!</li>
            <li> i love the colors the only thing is that the makeup was opened &amp; it didnt come with any little brush it looked a bit used</li>
            <li> I have greener than browner eyes and I would prefer a natural color palette to something pastel or neon any day. This one is pretty darn perfect.  It&#x27;s super easy to switch up which one would be your base or liner, depending on what look you like. It&#x27;s been dropped several times and stays together and strong.</li>
            <li> Same color as it was online.  So perfect to buy something online and have it  be the same as it was shown.</li>
            <li> This set has everything you need for a simple lid to a fun night out. Perfect colors! I love the instruction on the make-up too.</li>
            <li> Not only does this product nicely match the hues within the color selection, but it also highlights the right color eyes perfectly!  I highly recommend all eye colors to try this product, as the natural, beige, and latte mix tend to hit every skin tone and eye color naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of Maybelline&#x27;s greatest assets in amplifying this product is the fact that there is a clear distinction and description of where to place the make-up on the eyelid.  Not only does the color scheme fit nicely, but blended together, the shades dramatically illustrate the eyelid and eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, even though it is nice to have each square labeled, my compact was labeled by being written in the actual make-up.  I saw subsequent versions have the descriptions on the lid, but every time the customer would go to use it, you would have to open and close the lid to see what shadow went where.  I liked having the descriptions in the make-up, but after a few uses the writing was blended away.  I know that some labels ended up with the descriptions on the back, and hopefully Maybelline caught on that this was the best way to go for those who had trouble applying the make-up to different areas of the eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the make-up itself, when blended correctly and applied generously, last a very long time, with a high quality look.  Done right, this make-up can look as if the most priciest eye shadow is on your eyelid.  I very much recommend this product, not only because of the beautiful hues within the make-up, but for the long lasting shades, and the high quality of make-up for the low cost of the total compact.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my sister. It helps to make eyes more beautiful. The price is fairly good. But the brushes are of bad quality.</li>
            <li> This product caught my eye a few weeks before I bought it, and I&#x27;m glad I did. It&#x27;s very pretty and I think it looks great on anyone.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand the sample images provided by the merchant (as of writing), they all look like they&#x27;re wearing a single layer of greyish-blue eyeshadow...(???)&lt;br /&gt;The colors in the Maybelline color quads are very rich and robust without looking garish.</li>
            <li> Was surprised there were two in the package, as I thought I was buying only one. That made it an extra good deal. The base color basically doesn&#x27;t show up. However, it may prevent creasing, so I&#x27;ve been using it. The colors are good. I&#x27;m fair. Blonde hair, blue eyes. The colors ad definition and make my eyes stand out. Good product.</li>
            <li> The colors are quite a bit darker than anticipated, I had to wipe most of it off to get the soft color I was going for.</li>
            <li> This was actually the first eye shadow I  bought myself about three or four years ago. I have now grown to love makeup and the palette is great for starters. It actually has some dupes in it that&#x27;s in the urban decay naked palette. As long as your wear a eyeshadow primer before putting it on it will last all day.</li>
            <li> very easy to use and good one to have it in your bag, very compact and hassle free, the shades are good</li>
            <li> I have used this product twice. Both times I got irritation and eyelids bumps. I am aware that some people get eyelid bumps for other reasons, but I had got them twice in my entire life - both of these times after using this particular Maybelline NY eyeshadow. The first time I thought it might be a coincidence, but now I got them again, one day after using the eyeshadows. Clearly, I would not advise anyone to use this product.</li>
            <li> I dont like the applicator that comes with the eyeshadow, but its your standard sponge applicator.  The eyeshadow itself is great, and long wearing.  The gold is a very bronzey gold and super shimmery.  The dark brown looks great for a smoky effect and you can very easily go for a more neutral or bold look depending on the combination and how many layers you use.  overall, a great product.</li>
            <li> The colors in the photo. Real product is more orange. like the tall color looks like a really light sand, but its really more like a peach color.</li>
            <li> This little thing of eye makeup changed my whole makeup routine! Love that I can make the very dark color my &amp;#34;eyeliner&amp;#34;! I&#x27;ll be buying more when I run out! :)</li>
            <li> I think this is the first eyeshadow quad that I&#x27;ve known right away I would buy again and again. Often you get one and you only like one or two colors, but I liked them all. Great neutral tones. Depending on whether it&#x27;s for day or night, you can apply these colors in different ways and get a fantastic look. Only one color (Bronze at the top right corner) has a lot of shimmer to it, so that&#x27;s the color I play with most to make it more of an evening look. Basically I just love it! Great price as well!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use for my wedding makeup for my wedding in October of this year. I was really happy with the color, it looks just as it does in the picture. I cannot wait to do some &amp;#34;test runs&amp;#34; with this color pallet. Another feature I really liked about this set, is that it labels on each color square where at to use that particular color on your eye.</li>
            <li> This product is as expected. Ive bought this before so i knew what I was receiving.  Great convenience! good buy</li>
            <li> New to me but I really like it!</li>
            <li> The top right color is a bit orange but I use a MAC for that color-all the other colors are good.  ^_^</li>
            <li> On line the picture looked more rose colored, it is hard to tell by the picture. It is definitely shades of brown.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eyeshadow! its natural and so pretty, i have gotten many compliments on it! I would recommend this product to anyone and will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I love the colors and it is a great price. It is marked also to show you where each color should go.</li>
            <li> Love the colors and the subtle hints of shimmer. This is a great color combo and I use them all the time!</li>
            <li> A little shimmer. A little sparkle. The dark brown can double as a liner if you don&#x27;t want a harsh line of a pencil.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and they work well with my dark complexion but after the first use the attachment that hold the cover on broke in one corner and the cover no longer stay on. I can still use the product but I am no longer able to take it with me as it will be damaged in my purse.</li>
            <li> I originally ordered this product and it arrived in poor condition: busted up container, missing one application wand,  broken shadows. I did however LOVE LOVE LOVE the colors!!! I asked if I could just get a replacement and Amazon sent me a replacement SUPER FAST!!! This one arrived in perfect condition and the colors are just perfecto. Happy neutral eyes! ;) Amazon made the correction easy and the representative I chatted w was professional and super helpful. Me&#x3D;Happy Amazon shopper w good looking eyeshadow! :)</li>
            <li> this is great for smokey eyes or just wanting a nice soft color. good quality for the price.  :) :P</li>
            <li> Gorgeous colours :)&lt;br /&gt;Great every day make up. :)&lt;br /&gt;Cannot blend with the brushes given though.&lt;br /&gt;Great for every skin tone.</li>
            <li> I like only one of the colors.  The colors are  just not for me. It&#x27;s just okay.  The colors might look good on other women.  You have to try it to find out.  Good luck.</li>
            <li> I really like the combination together, i was  having difficulty finding browns that were soft, wears very well, complements my dark skin tone.</li>
            <li> My go to palette. LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Chai latte is a very good everyday eyeshadow for work or school. It has very neutral colors which can be used lightly and are still build-able. The base color kind of gets lost on my skin tone but I really like the shimmer on top. My favorite is still the urban decay naked palette but this would be an inexpensive option.&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to ask any questions regarding the product or my review and leave me feedback !&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> small simple with wonderful results</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Maybelline. From their mascaras, to their lipsticks, and of course, their eye shadows! I was super excited about this set of colors because I adore nude/natural colors but also like dark browns and beige&#x27;s. Well, this set fit my expectation perfectly. The colors stay on for a long time and I hardly had any fall out. Love love love this!</li>
            <li> I think this eyeshadow pallet is pretty good, and it stays on well. However, I don&#x27;t really like the lid color (color 2), it appears really orange on my skin. I&#x27;m Asian, so it could be my skin tone that makes it seem this way. I do like the other 3 colors though, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a complete waste. Too bad the lid color is just too orange and makes me look funny.</li>
            <li> Amazing for a natural look!!!! All colors suit my skin tone. Maybelline has fantastic palettes. Will definitely purchase Again!!!!! Cheap beginners make up alternative</li>
            <li> I love these colors together. The eye shadow blends on my skin well and looks great. It has a nice shimmer to it as well. I&#x27;ve received several compliments when wearing this eye shadow.</li>
            <li> Nice neutral shadow shades. Would work with every skin tone.</li>
            <li> great colors and good product, I have allot of allergies and this product did not hurt my eyes, thank you!</li>
            <li> I purchased this eyeshadow years ago when I first started wearing makeup. And Il loved how it had the steps on how to place the shadow! I fell in love from then. Oh and its also very good makeup as well :)</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this product because it has become my new favorite I just wish there were more color palettes to chose from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;-easy to use&lt;br /&gt;-if you are unsure of how to apply the product detailed instructions are available on the back&lt;br /&gt;-the palette really looks nice once you get the hang of it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-I wish there were more colors to chose from&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be aware there are sparkles in the highlighting color so if you don&#x27;t want sparkles don&#x27;t buy it. It is not overly sparkly like a stripper but they are noticeable.</li>
            <li> Good product and as described. I have hazel eyes and olive skin and the color pallete goes well with both.</li>
            <li> This could have been packaged better....I don&#x27;t know how it arrived unbroken with the way it was packaged. I&#x27;ve used Maybelline for years and loved finding this on Amazon at a fair price. I simply throw out my make up once a year and buy new so this was a good value for me to replace my favorite daily products with nice new clean make up.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and achieve great color/ shading with the four panels. I like the little bit of sparkle in the color.</li>
            <li> love these shades... did both my eyes and my roommates eyes yesterday, got numerous compliments. best if you do thick black eyeliner for a dramatic look.</li>
            <li> Not bad, but its hard to keep the shadow just on the lids. I find my face a bit glittery and shimmery as the day goes on and the shadow falls from my lids. I never wear several layers of eyeshadow and blend well and even apply a top layer of powder over my shadow to help keep it in place, but this stuff never stays put. To be fair, I do not use a eyeshadow primer or base, but I refuse to buy those when my other eye makeup does not require it. Cute colors, and easy to put on.</li>
            <li> Love the colors and they stay on well. Great price and lasts a long time. The color did not smear and stayed on all day.</li>
            <li> Great Product, I love the color and it has a goog explanation of how to use it....I recomend it..It is good!!</li>
            <li> i was very happy when i got this, i was not aware that it came as a 2 pack so i was excited to see that i got two of them!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  My eyes are really sensitive - I have had reactions numerous times to different eye shadows--from the super cheap stuff at the grocery store to department store brands that blow my budget.  This one has yet to bother me.  The pigment in this shadow is good--not as good as Smashbox or LARS, but it&#x27;s far better than any of the other brands I find in the makeup aisle at Walmart or Target.  The instructions are helpful too--they walk you right through the first application.  As would be expected, the little sponge brushes that are included are totally useless, but I use shadow brushes anyway.  I really like the colors!</li>
            <li> The skinny:&lt;br /&gt;Base – looks light/shimmery, but it’s not bad once it’s on&lt;br /&gt;Crease – warm taupe. Acceptable transition color. I use this on lower lashline for work.&lt;br /&gt;Lid – warm bronze; performs better than you might expect. Pretty nice. Best color in here.&lt;br /&gt;Liner - wants to be a lighter shade of Mac “Notoriety” (from Leopard Luxe palette). This should come off much richer and does not. I set the liner on my top lashline w this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 3 of these palettes (also have Chic Naturals 10Q Mocha Motion and Stylish Smokes 02Q Natural Smokes). They just look so pretty then they go on sale so you’re like why not. Then you try them and they’re unimpressive and you don’t do much with them until you dedicate yourself to using them up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never use these palettes solo for a look. I don’t think they’re strong enough to stand alone. But for the sake of this review, I used Chai Latte – all the colors, together for a complete eye look. I was pleasantly surprised. It created a soft bronze eye, nice for summer or any other time. The colors work well together and feel less powdery than the other palettes previously mentioned. There is not a lot of dimension, but the variation is enough to make it interesting. Good if you are on a budget and want something different, are just starting out in makeup, feel like purchasing something at the drugstore (without high expectations), or need a cheap palette to keep at bf/sister/whoever’s. Worth the sale price, not more. Not bad for what it is. Although this is the best one of the 3 palettes I own, I would not repurchase.</li>
            <li> very glitzy, very glittery, and stays on surprisingly well. Doesn&#x27;t smudge, but will leave glittery dust on your cheeks if you&#x27;re not careful in the application</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 4.97 at walmart.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this quad! I don&#x27;t use the liner part but the lid and crease color look great on any skin tone. My boyfriend is a huge critic when it comes to make-up (he likes the natural beauty thing) and even he thought it looked great. I recommend that before you decide to wear this eyeshadow out anywhere that you experiment with it at home first. Learn how to use it beforehand so that you don&#x27;t feel insecure wearing it to go out. Other than that, it is beautiful and I will definitely be buying another one.</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter who is in collage.  She loves the product and is trying a lot of different eye looks.  Arrived on time and undamaged.</li>
            <li> Eye shadow does not last throughout the day and clumps in creases. Good for a few hours wear perhaps at night, goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Great everyday quad.  Need a good eye primmer to make colors pop.  There&#x27;s a bit of fall out, but that was expected for the price.</li>
            <li> This is a very good eye shadow quad especially for the price its very pretty I love it ! !</li>
