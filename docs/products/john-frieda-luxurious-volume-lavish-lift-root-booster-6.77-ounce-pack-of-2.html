            <li>After my best friend introduced me to this spray, I&#x27;ve been using John Frieda Luxurious Volume Lavish Life Root Booster for four or five years and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for fine hair.</li>
            <li>This is a good product to add body to your hair before styling.  </li>
            <li>This gives my shorts hair lift and I don&#x27;t feel like I need to use hair spray afterwards because it looks so good.</li>
            <li>I discovered this a while ago and fell in love with the incredible volume it added to my hair.</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>Although this product doesn&#x27;t thicken your hair but it does give you nice volume on the top!!</li>
            <li>Applied sparingly at the roots on freshly shampooed and conditioned hair this was an excellent product.</li>
            <li>Love the volume!</li>
            <li>This is a great product at great price, thanks</li>
            <li>Light and smells good</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that is not color treated or permed, etc.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine, fly-away hair that can never hold a style.  </li>
            <li>I love this hair product.  </li>
            <li>I love this root booster.</li>
            <li>Glad I can order from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love the spray and</li>
            <li>I try not to rub it into my scalp, though, because it will cause it to itch (most hair products do that to me).</li>
            <li>You will love it.</li>
            <li>feeling&amp;#34; on your hair it will be fine for your use.  </li>
            <li>which is not what my fine hair needs.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>I have fine hair.</li>
            <li>I would most certainly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>because there is a stick on lable on the top cover that announces a new look coming soon which depicts a pump top, which I DO NOT want, so I am stocking up.  </li>
            <li>I used to be able to find this item at Target, but sadly, no longer.</li>
            <li>product will give your roots adequate boost, but I found this product sticky and my hair felt like it had a lot of lacquer in it.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s very long and this product does a really awesome job of keeping it from looking flat and lifeless.</li>
            <li>or it&#x27;s kind of stiff feeling if you use more.  </li>
            <li>and I would feel comfortable recommending it to someone with normal hair.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find it in my local store any more.  </li>
            <li>Gives great lift to my thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li>I am glad to have found it because it is the only product I have been able to find that gives me styling hold but is light enough to not weigh down my fine hair</li>
            <li>You also don&#x27;t need to use much.  </li>
            <li>It does help, but I had expected it to be a bit stronger so to add more lift.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>This products really lifts your hair at the roots.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice, but if I spray it too heavily, my hair seems grungy.</li>
            <li>then on the top sides and back where needed and lastly on the front and front sides.  </li>
            <li>This product came to me highly recommended to help lift my hair from the roots.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair; it gives it some lift, but not much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, it does add a little spring to your hair</li>
            <li>Not heavy or sticky!  </li>
            <li>I used to have the Paul Mitchell brand of this, I like it better as this one I found a bit sticky and my hair looks dirty very quickly.</li>
            <li>I have used this in the past and thought it actually worked better than Paul Mitchell Volumizing Spray.</li>
            <li>I could go all day with only this and then at night add hair spray for a More dramatic look.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t heavy, won&#x27;t dry your hair out, and gives the right amount of lift.</li>

            <li> This is a good product to add body to your hair before styling.  Not heavy or sticky!  I can&#x27;t find it in my local store any more.  Amazon is great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, it does add a little spring to your hair but I think that the down side is that it either disappears if you don&#x27;t use a lot or it&#x27;s kind of stiff feeling if you use more.  If you don&#x27;t mind that &amp;#34;hairsprayed feeling&amp;#34; on your hair it will be fine for your use.  It&#x27;s not good for me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t always find this in the store, so I order online. Perfect for fine hair.</li>
            <li> I love this hair product.  I have very fine hair that is not color treated or permed, etc.  My hair is fairly thin and limp, but this product give me the lift I need to create some volume without weighing down my style.</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past and thought it actually worked better than Paul Mitchell Volumizing Spray. Applied sparingly at the roots on freshly shampooed and conditioned hair this was an excellent product. I recently ran out of this and hightailed myself to the local CVS. The only thing I found was a John Frieda Root Booster in a slightly different package. I bought this and am now wondering if the repackaging reflected a change in the formula.&lt;br /&gt;This product will give your roots adequate boost, but I found this product sticky and my hair felt like it had a lot of lacquer in it. This is probably o.k. in a pinch, but I won&#x27;t buy it again because I don&#x27;t like sticky or greasy products for my hair.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff every morning when I dry my hair!  It isn&#x27;t heavy, won&#x27;t dry your hair out, and gives the right amount of lift.</li>
            <li> I love this root booster. I&#x27;ve used 5 bottles already. I just spray a little on the roots of my bangs, blow dry them a little and they look great all day. I used to be able to find this item at Target, but sadly, no longer. Glad I can order from Amazon.</li>
            <li> What a shame when I realized that this product was not going to be producted anymore.  What is it with companies halting production on an item when they have hit a home run????</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy this again.  Gives great lift to my thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I just began using this product and it seems to work well without being sticky.</li>
            <li> This product works great on my hair but I can no longer find it around my home. I am glad to have found it because it is the only product I have been able to find that gives me styling hold but is light enough to not weigh down my fine hair</li>
            <li> This gives my shorts hair lift and I don&#x27;t feel like I need to use hair spray afterwards because it looks so good. I could go all day with only this and then at night add hair spray for a More dramatic look.</li>
            <li> After my best friend introduced me to this spray, I&#x27;ve been using John Frieda Luxurious Volume Lavish Life Root Booster for four or five years and absolutely love it.  I have very long hair and, as a result, I have to wait for my hair to dry after shampooing because there is no way I could brush it out while wet and I refuse to use a hair rinse because it leaves my hair limp and oily which is not what my fine hair needs.  After my hair dries, I blow and brush it out, then spray my hair \\&quot;upside down\\&quot; then on the top sides and back where needed and lastly on the front and front sides.  After  my hair dries from that ritual, I then use an electric curler, brush my hair out, back brush it and put it up with a clip.  This product is difficult to find and rather than driving from drug store to drug store I found it here on Amazon and buying four at a time for a decent price AND being a Prime Member there is no shipping charge and it&#x27;s usually delivered in two business days.  PERFECT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1-14-13:  I keep ordering this [[ASIN:B0067YUFSA John Frieda Luxurious Volume Lavish Lift Root Booster, 6.77 Ounce (Pack of 2)]] because there is a stick on lable on the top cover that announces a new look coming soon which depicts a pump top, which I DO NOT want, so I am stocking up.  I love the spray and if the product is changed they will have lost a customer in me.</li>
            <li> I use this often.  If you have thin hair it really gives your hair some &#x27;umph&#x27; and it&#x27;s not sticky.  You also don&#x27;t need to use much.  A little goes a long way.  I&#x27;ve been using this for quite a while now and have no complaints to mention.</li>
            <li> Light and smells good</li>
            <li> I have very fine, fly-away hair that can never hold a style.  This John Frieda product did a great job of adding volume and maintaining my look!</li>
            <li> I discovered this a while ago and fell in love with the incredible volume it added to my hair. I have fine hair that&#x27;s very long and this product does a really awesome job of keeping it from looking flat and lifeless. Love the volume! I would most certainly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This product came to me highly recommended to help lift my hair from the roots. It does help, but I had expected it to be a bit stronger so to add more lift. I have fine hair and it seems impossible to find any product that will do what I want it to do. This product does do what it&#x27;s advertised to do and I would feel comfortable recommending it to someone with normal hair.</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected. This product works wonders especially with a tease brush which I also ordered on amazon. My hair is very flat and I hate it. I&#x27;ve always wanted thick hair. Although this product doesn&#x27;t thicken your hair but it does give you nice volume on the top!! I&#x27;ve always had problems trying to get my hair to tease and stay that way but with this spray it&#x27;s very simple and works well. definitely recommend</li>
            <li> Works very well.  I can adjust the amount to suit the stage my hair is at between body perms.  I try not to rub it into my scalp, though, because it will cause it to itch (most hair products do that to me).</li>
            <li> The root boosting works! After using an expensive and drying other product, I discovered John Frieda&#x27;s at a CVS. Now that store seems to have discontinued it. I&#x27;m happy to find it online and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every time I blow dry my hair. It&#x27;s nice, but if I spray it too heavily, my hair seems grungy. I have fine hair; it gives it some lift, but not much.</li>
            <li> Excellent! A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Good product.  I have fine hair.</li>
            <li> I used to have the Paul Mitchell brand of this, I like it better as this one I found a bit sticky and my hair looks dirty very quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a great product at great price, thanks</li>
            <li> This products really lifts your hair at the roots.  You will love it.</li>
            <li> This left my hair crunchy and weighed down.  I like the shampoo and conditioner in this line and read lots of favorable reviews of this spray.  Yuck!</li>
