            <li>LOVE EM.</li>
            <li>I have kind of small hands &amp; they fit me perfectly.  </li>
            <li>They fit great, i have small hands and can never find gloves that fit good</li>
            <li>They are snug and secure.</li>
            <li>FIT</li>
            <li>they got here, they fit, I had to clip some strings off but who doesn&#x27;t?</li>
            <li>they are cheap.  </li>
            <li>AN WAS SUPER COMFORTABLE</li>
            <li>My hands are super small and they fit me great</li>

            <li>Customer service was VERY accommodating to the error and sent me the correct gloves without my having to return the brown gloves.</li>
            <li>Arrived in good condition, minor loose threads, nothing major.</li>
            <li>A little tigher than anticipated but otherwise love.</li>

            <li> The fit a tad bit smaller than the red vision does, which makes them a tiny bit uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> They arrived earlier than expected since they ship from China.</li>
            <li> If the who ever they are for has largest hands or long fingers these will probably not work for them.</li>
            <li> a black pair and a red pair for a Harley Quinn costume.</li>
            <li> ARIVED SOONER THAN EXPECTED.</li>
            <li> Item is what was expected.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would definitely recommend to anyone with small hands!</li>
            <li> Will order all other colors</li>
            <li> So do not order if you have average size hands.</li>
            <li> Although I received dark brown gloves instead of the black gloves I had ordered.</li>
            <li> but they stretch a little bit and are still comfy.</li>
            <li> For being 21 i have little kid hands</li>
            <li> Waaay to small and tight but for the price I paid it will work for my Halloween costume for the night.</li>
            <li> These gloves still are too small.</li>
            <li> have small hands and arms and they are a tad bit snug.</li>
            <li> -they have&#x27;t fallen apart on me yet, at least</li>
            <li> But too bad.</li>

            <li> I love these! They are snug and secure.</li>
            <li> Love the gloves.  I have kind of small hands &amp; they fit me perfectly.  Will order all other colors</li>
            <li> ARIVED SOONER THAN EXPECTED. FIT SO PERFECT AN WAS SUPER COMFORTABLE</li>
            <li> These are surprisingly nice for the price!! I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much and they definitely made me happy :) They are quite small as other reviews have mentioned, if you are petite these are a great purchase. They were a tad snug on me but they stretch a little bit and are still comfy. I originally just planned on wearing these with costumes but they&#x27;ll likely become a regular accessory :)</li>
            <li> Well, it does look good and it fit me well. I was expecting rashes from the leatherette, but thankfully, didnt get any.</li>
            <li> Item is what was expected. Arrived in good condition, minor loose threads, nothing major. Will go great with my costume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5&#x27;2 100 lbs and my hands are on the smaller side. These gloves still are too small. They&#x27;ll do though. Took 2 or 3 weeks to get it.</li>
            <li> they got here, they fit, I had to clip some strings off but who doesn&#x27;t? LOVE EM. Would buy em again.</li>
            <li> They fit great, i have small hands and can never find gloves that fit good and these do! For being 21 i have little kid hands xD im not a big person.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m medium frame person and these fit my hands perfectly</li>
            <li> A little tigher than anticipated but otherwise love. If you are on the overweight size or just have large hands. Forget it.&lt;br /&gt;I have small hands and arms and they are a tad bit snug.</li>
            <li> Price: $1.99 + $1.00 shipping from changeshopping&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered a black pair and a red pair for a Harley Quinn costume. They arrived earlier than expected since they ship from China. Only took 15 days to arrived in Florida after order date. My hands are super small and they fit me great (I&#x27;m 5&#x27;2&amp;#34; 110 lbs)! So do not order if you have average size hands. Quality is great for the cheap price. Great for a costume but probably not for everyday wear. They smelled pretty strong when I first took them out of the packaging but the smell went away after leaving them out for a while. Overall, I would definitely recommend to anyone with small hands!</li>
            <li> Waaay to small and tight but for the price I paid it will work for my Halloween costume for the night.</li>

            <li> They where cool a little snug but they do stretch really sexy they bring a lot of fun to your outfit</li>
            <li> i got them for a costume because they were cheep and it turned out ... they are cheap.  If the who ever they are for has largest hands or long fingers these will probably not work for them.</li>
            <li> used these for my harley quinn cosplay, and i&#x27;ll now pair them with most any outfit! they fit nicely and seem to be of a good quality-they have&#x27;t fallen apart on me yet, at least</li>
            <li> Although I received dark brown gloves instead of the black gloves I had ordered. Customer service was VERY accommodating to the error and sent me the correct gloves without my having to return the brown gloves.</li>
