            <li>Good price, and great perfume.</li>
            <li>Smells divine when you spray it on, but dries to something even more wonderful.</li>
            <li>A bit pricy but nice !</li>
            <li>I always loved it.</li>
            <li>with its own character and herbal, woodsy undertones with a bit of moss and just smells like stardust lol.</li>
            <li>It is sophisticated; just absolutely beautiful.  </li>
            <li>if you will- i consider it an ultra sophisticated version of chanel egoiste platinum lol.  </li>
            <li>What can I say - I love it!</li>
            <li>beautiful bottle and the contents were fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Or, to put it another way, it is the kind of scent that is not trying to appeal to everybody.</li>
            <li>It stands on its own and speaks for itself.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re familiar with it from department stores and you love it, and you want a good deal, then go for it!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the product and will order more.</li>
            <li>does not seem to be as strong as in the past.it is still good.</li>
            <li>This is a great perfume and the price was super.  </li>
            <li>Eau du Soir is the kind of scent that makes you want to be a better person.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love it!</li>
            <li>Was so happy to find it here and for a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>Packaging was more than adequate, the product functioned, and the price was good.</li>
            <li>I love this parfum.  </li>
            <li>And I love it.</li>
            <li>I have puchased it many times.</li>
            <li>It does not overwhelm the senses and I use more than one spritz.</li>
            <li>I love it and you will too.</li>
            <li>This perfume always elicits fantastic comments whenever I wear it!  </li>
            <li>Although Amazon&#x27;s description mentions notes of \\&quot;moss and woods\\&quot; in describing what this scent contains, it would be more accurate to describe the scents as mingled jasmine, rose, and another powder-y scent I can&#x27;t put a name to.  </li>
            <li>It has been my favorite for many years.&lt;br /&gt;Light, but the fragrance lasts forever.</li>
            <li>We have been very happy with its freshness; it is actually cheaper to buy it here than to buy it in France where it is manufactured.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume of all time.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase and deliver</li>
            <li>for many years and did not have any problem.</li>
            <li>Both mine and my husbands favorite.  </li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this perfume for my sister in Brazil and all I can tell you is that she follow in love to it.</li>
            <li>I love how it smells on me.  </li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>I happened upon this scent and was instantly in love.  </li>
            <li>I finally bit the bullet and ordered this wonderful fragrance.  </li>
            <li>however it met all my expections and more.  </li>
            <li>Glad I could purchase here.</li>
            <li>Love it....</li>
            <li>good product, fast shipping</li>
            <li>I spray it lightly in my hair and it catches the attention of the tall guys as I walk by.  </li>
            <li>I get many complements about how fresh it smells.</li>
            <li>Save your money and buy from the store or duty free.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone looking for something special.</li>
            <li>Could only get it at Nordstrom at a much higher price so it is great</li>
            <li>Not to mention how cool the bottle is.</li>
            <li>It is light, crispy, fresh.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s elegant and classic.</li>
            <li>Beautiful fragrance and extremely well priced!!</li>
            <li>I am not a huge fan of the rose fragrances, but in Eau du Soir rose is calm and mild.</li>
            <li>I have been using Eau du soir for several years and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>The perfume turned into a fresh, light mixed of the country air with a touch of cinnamon and rose.</li>
            <li>Although rose plays the key role in this fragrance, Eau du Soir does also contain moss and woods.</li>
            <li>However, the unexpected discovery was that after two days, I am now in love with the scent on her, around her, and around the house.</li>
            <li>It is a bit pricey for an online perfume purchase, but after my discovery, the price is worth it though.</li>
            <li>So be warned, you might not like this at first, but if you gave it an honest try, you might wonder why it took you this long to discover it.</li>
            <li>generally prefer clean, light scents, and this is a sophisticated, deep perfume.  </li>
            <li>I got it as a gift for someone that like &#x27;s Sisley very much she raves about it</li>
            <li>Always my first choice of perfume.  </li>
            <li>However, I wouldn&#x27;t advise buying this perfume without giving it a try first.</li>
            <li>It is my mother&#x27;s favorite and this is the second time I have ordered it from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Warning, you might not like this product if your regular perfume is sweet and light.</li>
            <li>I did not like it at all when my wife first used it.</li>
            <li>Great long lasting scent.</li>
            <li>It is - and probably stays for the rest of my life - my absolute number one!</li>
            <li>First purchased at Harrod&#x27;s in London.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good perfume and last longer than regular ones.</li>
            <li>I love this parfum, I wear it a long time ago.</li>
            <li>It starts out strong and  last all day.</li>
            <li>I like it *almost as much*...</li>
            <li>thanks a lot for this item I like a lot</li>
            <li>Now when I came home from a long day at work, catching the scent of this lightly lingered perfume around the house, what can I say, the nerves all calmed down.     </li>
            <li>It has a very strong and dominant moss-like smell on your nostrils initially and can last for awhile.</li>
            <li>It really attracts the opposite sex along with making you feel special.</li>
            <li>i think this might go on special/clearance because its a pretty masculine scent frankly.</li>
            <li>And yes the rose is there, expecially when the body heat up if you know what I mean</li>
            <li>it does not last much than a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>that is almost gone and its last the whole day while this one after 1 h the smell is gone.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing, but I found it odd</li>
            <li>Stays on well, a little bit goes a long way - can be a bit strong.</li>
            <li>it was the real deal and half price.</li>

            <li> This perfume is not available where we live.  </li>
            <li> The scent lasted all day long and lingered into the night.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is long lasting especially when layered with the Eau du Sour body cream by Sisley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon- again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Different than any other.  </li>
            <li> It took me this long to find a replacement for my wife perfume after Victoria Secret cancelled their blue perfume bottle.</li>
            <li> This perfume has a delicate but very present aroma.  </li>
            <li> I prefer scents that are a little less</li>
            <li> I prefer Eau Du Soir after a couple hours have passed; it could be overpowering if applied too heavily.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what it is about this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I was not sure what I was going to get-  </li>
            <li> And very green.</li>
            <li> that a scent created in 1990 smelled, well, so old-fashioned, like a scent from the &#x27;40&#x27;s (or at least, as I imagine a scent from the &#x27;40&#x27;s would smell).  </li>
            <li> I have to ware it every day even if its expensive.  </li>
            <li> this perfume seems to be fake!!.</li>
            <li> However, this one that I got for her seems fake!!</li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this parfum.  I spray it lightly in my hair and it catches the attention of the tall guys as I walk by.  Could only get it at Nordstrom at a much higher price so it is great that I know I can get it thru Amazon now.  Used the gift card my son sent me for Mother&#x27;s Day.</li>
            <li> Good product! Good seller!!</li>
            <li> I am not sure what it is about this fragrance. OK, it&#x27;s quite expensive as the rest of Sisley products, that I can&#x27;t justify. But I&#x27;ve received this fragrance as a gift, thankfullly. And I love it. When I wear it I always get comments from men asking what I am wearing. Not from women, but always from men. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in it, but it&#x27;s got to be some pheromone or something that does something to men. What can I say - I love it!</li>
            <li> Buy it.  Buy it you will be happy. It&#x27;s elegant and classic. I have puchased it many times. It does not overwhelm the senses and I use more than one spritz. I love it and you will too. Not to mention how cool the bottle is.</li>
            <li> Excellent experience from beginning to end. Speed of shipping communication, packaging and product.  Definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> This perfume always elicits fantastic comments whenever I wear it!  Always my first choice of perfume.  Good price, and great perfume.</li>
            <li> I have been using Eau du soir for several years and I am very pleased. It&#x27;s a good perfume and last longer than regular ones.</li>
            <li> Although Amazon&#x27;s description mentions notes of \\&quot;moss and woods\\&quot; in describing what this scent contains, it would be more accurate to describe the scents as mingled jasmine, rose, and another powder-y scent I can&#x27;t put a name to.  I can&#x27;t think of any other words to describe this scent except \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot;.

I could imagine Bette Davis wearing this perfume, while she filmed her movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally prefer clean, light scents, and this is a sophisticated, deep perfume.  In some moods, I do like to wear this.  It announces itself (if that makes sense).  I think that&#x27;s part of the reason I don&#x27;t always care for it - I prefer scents that are a little less intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree that it is an evening scent, as mentioned in Amazon&#x27;s description.  I prefer Eau Du Soir after a couple hours have passed; it could be overpowering if applied too heavily.</li>
            <li> The Amazon description is correct. Although rose plays the key role in this fragrance, Eau du Soir does also contain moss and woods. And they are quite noticeable since it is a chypre floral fragrance. One of the best of this kind. Perhaps THE best. Undoubtedly, my favourite perfume. It is light, crispy, fresh. I am not a huge fan of the rose fragrances, but in Eau du Soir rose is calm and mild. And very green. Eau du Soir is the kind of scent that makes you want to be a better person. However, I wouldn&#x27;t advise buying this perfume without giving it a try first. As it often happens with chypre fragrances, it is not going to appeal to everybody. Or, to put it another way, it is the kind of scent that is not trying to appeal to everybody. It stands on its own and speaks for itself.</li>
            <li> Eau Du Soir is my only parfum.  It has been my favorite for many years.&lt;br /&gt;Light, but the fragrance lasts forever.</li>
            <li> This perfume is not available where we live.  It is my mother&#x27;s favorite and this is the second time I have ordered it from Amazon.  We have been very happy with its freshness; it is actually cheaper to buy it here than to buy it in France where it is manufactured.</li>
            <li> The Women&#x27;s is almost like the Men&#x27;s Eau de Soir...I like it *almost as much*...I&#x27;m happy w~it, though😎</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume of all time. Smells divine when you spray it on, but dries to something even more wonderful.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this item it&#x27;s EXCELENTE!...I will recommended to every one!...thanks a lot for this item I like a lot</li>
            <li> I got it as a gift for someone that like &#x27;s Sisley very much she raves about it&lt;br /&gt;thank you for sending it&lt;br /&gt;Lore Schoeller</li>
            <li> I love this perfume . It starts out strong and  last all day. I get many complements about how fresh it smells.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase and deliver</li>
            <li> this perfume seems to be fake!!. it does not last much than a couple of hours. after that, it seems you have not applied it by the morning.</li>
            <li> My Mom loves this perfume!! However, this one that I got for her seems fake!! The smell doesn&#x27;t last at all. She has a 30 ml that is almost gone and its last the whole day while this one after 1 h the smell is gone. Save your money and buy from the store or duty free.</li>
            <li> A bit pricy but nice !</li>
            <li> Beautiful fragrance and extremely well priced!!</li>
            <li> This has been my very best perfume. Thank you. It arrived perfectly</li>
            <li> good product, fast shipping</li>
            <li> Warning, you might not like this product if your regular perfume is sweet and light. I did not like it at all when my wife first used it. Yes, I did tell her I hate it. It has a very strong and dominant moss-like smell on your nostrils initially and can last for awhile. However, the unexpected discovery was that after two days, I am now in love with the scent on her, around her, and around the house. The perfume turned into a fresh, light mixed of the country air with a touch of cinnamon and rose. The scent lasted all day long and lingered into the night. And yes the rose is there, expecially when the body heat up if you know what I mean (wink). Now when I came home from a long day at work, catching the scent of this lightly lingered perfume around the house, what can I say, the nerves all calmed down.     It is a bit pricey for an online perfume purchase, but after my discovery, the price is worth it though. It took me this long to find a replacement for my wife perfume after Victoria Secret cancelled their blue perfume bottle. So be warned, you might not like this at first, but if you gave it an honest try, you might wonder why it took you this long to discover it.</li>
            <li> I use Eau Du Soir By Sisley For Women . Eau De Parfum Spray  for many years and did not have any problem. The last time I ordered the same, but I do not know why I have allergy , scratching . It looks like I received something different . The same box, the&lt;br /&gt;same bottle , but not the same result. What it could be?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for years and people still stop me and ask me what it is.  I love it!!!</li>
            <li> does not seem to be as strong as in the past.it is still good.</li>
            <li> Both mine and my husbands favorite.  I have to ware it every day even if its expensive.  I get complements all the time.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it.  The very best of the best perfumes.  It really attracts the opposite sex along with making you feel special.</li>
            <li> I love this parfum, I wear it a long time ago. Perfect for the evening.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend wears it all the time. I always loved it. Great long lasting scent. I am very happy. I probably will order it again.</li>
            <li> Eau Du Soir by Sisley has been my favourite parfum for years. It is - and probably stays for the rest of my life - my absolute number one! I love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I purchased this perfume for my sister in Brazil and all I can tell you is that she follow in love to it.</li>
            <li> Packaging was more than adequate, the product functioned, and the price was good.</li>
            <li> This perfume has a delicate but very present aroma.  I love how it smells on me.  I recommend it to anyone looking for something special.</li>
            <li> i was weary because of several reviews of this product suggesting that it would be diluted or fussed with so a seller could maintain a profit margin. and i lucked out. this was not so. i&#x27;ve bought it at an upscale department store and i had a bottle of it left over with a bit in it, received my order of a 3.3 in the mail and wrist to wrist it was the real deal and half price. very happy. i think this might go on special/clearance because its a pretty masculine scent frankly. so not every woman courting a sisley counter is going to want it. i&#x27;m a man and it works with my pheremones or my chemistry great- if you will- i consider it an ultra sophisticated version of chanel egoiste platinum lol.  with its own character and herbal, woodsy undertones with a bit of moss and just smells like stardust lol. and i love it. but anyway. if you&#x27;re familiar with it from department stores and you love it, and you want a good deal, then go for it! very happy.</li>
            <li> This is a great perfume and the price was super.  I purchased it as a gift for a friend and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I happened upon this scent and was instantly in love.  It is sophisticated; just absolutely beautiful.  Now my signature scent.</li>
            <li> The perfume was excellent and the price was really good.  I am very pleased with the product and will order more.</li>
            <li> Was so happy to find it here and for a reasonable price! Arrived on time and as promised. Don&#x27;t have to go to Paris to buy it.</li>
            <li> I have been eyeing this product for quite awhile.  I finally bit the bullet and ordered this wonderful fragrance.  I was not sure what I was going to get-  however it met all my expections and more.  It was everything that was promised.  Wonderful packaging-  beautiful bottle and the contents were fabulous.  The fragrance is long lasting especially when layered with the Eau du Sour body cream by Sisley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon- again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shannon Pera</li>
            <li> Beautiful fragrance.  First purchased at Harrod&#x27;s in London.  Reminds me of our trip.  Different than any other.  Glad I could purchase here.</li>
            <li> Stays on well, a little bit goes a long way - can be a bit strong.</li>
            <li> Love it....this is  my second  bottle  from amazon</li>
            <li> I discovered this in Paris years ago and now it is all I ever wear... The scent lingers all day!!</li>
