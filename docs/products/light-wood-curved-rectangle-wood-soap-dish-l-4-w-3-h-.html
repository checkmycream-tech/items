            <li>the soap stays in it better.  </li>
            <li>Well made and elegant, it is worth ordering another, so that&#x27;s what I just did.</li>
            <li>Anyways, she liked it so much I ordered one for me as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wood, and it holds soap; which is super cool, because I was looking for something wood that could hold soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes, the natural products are so much better, they rinse off quickly and don&#x27;t leave a gummy residue on my shower or the wood dishes...or me.</li>
            <li>I am old and I need good soap for my old skin.</li>
            <li>Liked it so much ordered a second one.</li>
            <li>far, it has held soap just fine, and it remains made out of wood (hasn&#x27;t changed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>only wish I had more soap</li>

            <li>They look like what you&#x27;d find in a high end spa, well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Too much hassle to return</li>
            <li>I have had it for a few months and so far it has held up nicely</li>
            <li>Well constructed and high quality.</li>
            <li>The simple design is just right.  </li>
            <li>so we live with it.</li>
            <li>I purchased it through Perfectly Natural Soap.</li>

            <li> These soap dishes keep your soap dry.</li>
            <li> I like the design on this because it&#x27;s curved down in the middle...</li>
            <li> This soap dish has no bottom at all, so it keeps the soap from wearing down prematurely, but it allows the surface underneath to get slimy with soap.</li>
            <li> I like this soap dish so well that I wish I would have seen it before I had gotten the other soap dishes!</li>
            <li> I switched to expensive natural bar soaps, and my usual soap dish had drainage grooves so shallow that my soap was turning to mush.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is about a half inch too wide for our shower shelf.  </li>
            <li> It is too expensive to let it get mushy.</li>

            <li> Great soap dish. We keep it in the shower so our soap does not get all over the tile shelf. It works great and it was a good price. I have had it for a few months and so far it has held up nicely</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wood, and it holds soap; which is super cool, because I was looking for something wood that could hold soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, it has held soap just fine, and it remains made out of wood (hasn&#x27;t changed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish I had more soap so I could buy more of these wood things.</li>

            <li> I switched to expensive natural bar soaps, and my usual soap dish had drainage grooves so shallow that my soap was turning to mush. This soap dish has no bottom at all, so it keeps the soap from wearing down prematurely, but it allows the surface underneath to get slimy with soap. I&#x27;m using it in the shower so it&#x27;s not a big deal, it would not work if it was resting on the sink.</li>
            <li> These soap dishes are very nicely made and functional.  They look like what you&#x27;d find in a high end spa, well worth the price.  I quit using regular store bought soaps and shampoos because of all the ingredients I couldn&#x27;t pronounce and was concerned about putting on my body.  Now I use a natural ingredients shampoo bar, soap bar, and facial bar so bought 3 dishes to accommodate.  Yes, the natural products are so much better, they rinse off quickly and don&#x27;t leave a gummy residue on my shower or the wood dishes...or me.</li>
            <li> Well made and elegant, it is worth ordering another, so that&#x27;s what I just did.</li>

            <li> It was a good size for soaps and had a nice design.</li>
            <li> Perfect size and seems like it will hold up well.  Good drainage so soap doesn&#x27;t get all squishy. Perfect for what we needed.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Bought it for my handmade soaps.  Looks really pretty in my bathroom.  I like the design on this because it&#x27;s curved down in the middle...the soap stays in it better.  Would definitely buy from again.  Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> My daughter had bought this for herself and my dog &amp;#34;accidently&amp;#34; thought it was a chewie.  Anyways, she liked it so much I ordered one for me as well. Very nice and is now kept way away from my tall dog. Beautify wood and keeps soap nice.</li>
            <li> I like this soap dish so well that I wish I would have seen it before I had gotten the other soap dishes! I purchased it through Perfectly Natural Soap. Got exactly what I ordered and before it was suppose to be here. Would shop there again.</li>
            <li> Bought the first soap dish. Well constructed and high quality. Serves its purpose well. Liked it so much ordered a second one.</li>
            <li> well constructed.  I&#x27;ve had it for months now, and the it maintains its coating and doesn&#x27;t warp in the shower.  Looks great, too.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  Allows water to drain from soap, thus prolonging the life of the soap.</li>
            <li> Beautiful wood working. Definitely a quality productn! :)</li>
            <li> nice looking- sturdy well made</li>
