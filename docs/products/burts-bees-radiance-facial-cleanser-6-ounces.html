            <li>Also it smells nice.</li>
            <li>It has a nice fragrance and it leaves my skin feeling refreshed, not stripped.</li>
            <li>Impressed with the gentle cleansing power of this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be honest, I wanted to buy this cleanser because of its packaging.</li>
            <li>but, this really is the BEST FACE WASH EVER!</li>
            <li>nice scent, cleans well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mild and works great.</li>

            <li>The best, even for my sensitive skin.</li>

            <li>My skin can be sensitive and this is one soap that is just perfect for my skin.</li>
            <li>It gets the makeup off and cleans my face leaving a nice radiant shine :)</li>
            <li>Using it now and loving it:)</li>
            <li>Overall great product for a great price.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, gets my face nice and clean with out drying it out.</li>
            <li>so it is very important to me not to smell the cleanser after.</li>

            <li>Love Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>I love many of Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell, ease of use and the way my skin feels after I use it.</li>
            <li>Incidently, I notice that my skin is moist and takes product a bit better.  </li>
            <li>I am much more confident since I don&#x27;t wear makeup</li>
            <li>I decided to try Burts bees radiance cleanser hoping for something better based on the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Great facial soap with a good price on amazon.</li>
            <li>Love the pump design.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not attesting some phenomenal results here on a difference in my skin, but I think it works well</li>
            <li>I love this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s interesting that I can \\&quot;feel\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I bought this at Target because I love BB</li>
            <li>and I love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I use this at night after washing with a more stringent cleaner.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>One of the best facial cleansers ever.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lathers up more than Cetaphyl (or any of those non-soap cleansers), but just a touch.</li>
            <li>Many comments Ive seen about this product are about the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>The cleanser may work fine, but I&#x27;m so distracted by the fragrance, and want it away from my face so quickly, that I can&#x27;t say much good about it.</li>
            <li>This is amazing cleanse my face just right!</li>
            <li>It has a very peculiar smell that is not at all pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Glad I can easily find it online</li>
            <li>and my face looks and feels more smooth and refreshed than ever.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smell so good, feel really nature, and it&#x27;s works well</li>
            <li>Takes off make up easy.  </li>
            <li>YES, the fragrance is a bit strong, but</li>
            <li>The scent is WAY too strong, smells like shampoo, squirts out too forcefully from the container, and has the consistency of...</li>
            <li>This is a very gentle yet effective cleanser.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very gentle and effective).</li>
            <li>I really liked this face wash the first hour I used it</li>
            <li>Hands down the best cleanser I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>but this is exceptional - truly feels high end.</li>
            <li>If I could design my own soap and figure out how much lather to put into it, this would be the sweet spot!</li>
            <li>The smell is not unpleasant, though it&#x27;s not my favorite either.</li>
            <li>It has these little scrubby balls that are perfect for the exfoliation and circulation of your skin.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s a huge plus.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for: a reasonably priced, natural face skincare routine that, at minimum, does not cause breakouts, and ideally clears me up and keeps all types of acne</li>
            <li>I started purchasing it here because it was no longer available where I work.  </li>
            <li>this stuff made my face feel so smooth after using for a week.</li>
            <li>Initially I thought that this was going to be great.  </li>
            <li>Great facial cleanser for women 50</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t care much for the smell it smells kind of smells like milk.</li>
            <li>It is gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE SMELL OF IT, IT SMELLS FRESH AND JUST SOOTHING IN A WAY.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this keeps my face feeling clean and removes my makeup easily, so I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>Beautiful and refreshing for an everyday wash.</li>
            <li>It gets my face clean, removes make-up and gives me smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>It has a unique smell but doesn&#x27;t linger after use.</li>
            <li>I love the whole Radiance line!  </li>
            <li>My skin feels clean after washing my face with this product.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t thoroughly clean my face -</li>
            <li>I found it to clean my skin</li>
            <li>I found it to give a squeaky clean feeling that was bit drying.</li>
            <li>It rinses clean.</li>
            <li>CLEAN AND LEAVE MY SKIN</li>
            <li>Fresh, clean, lightly fragranced.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was really getting clean, but I have not had any flare-ups of acne.  </li>
            <li>Nice on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>so much, I did the monthly subscribe and save. :)</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really want to spend money at Sephora or Nordstrom to find an alternative, and I am so pleased with the quality, experience, and price of this</li>
            <li>closed easily which is good for travel.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>I had previously bought Burts bees intense hydration which is pretty good with acceptable ingredients and a good smell, however I was looking for something better/more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Clean fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>Keep my skin fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>Cleans my face quickly and thoroughly.</li>
            <li>I am going to look into more radiance products in this line because this is the second product in the line I love.</li>
            <li>I really like the facial cleanser, it takes all of my eye makeup off with 1 application and it smells great.</li>
            <li>but then my face became super oily.</li>
            <li>At any rate, I was concerned that it would be too mild and not leave my skin clean-feeling, or that I would have oily breakouts.  </li>
            <li>It smells really good, it has the distinct smell of the royal jelly, similar to the day and night creme.</li>
            <li>I love this product and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>In fact, I am using the entire radiance line &amp; I love it!</li>
            <li>(I guess one benefit of a lifetime of oily skin is that I was 40 before my first lines appeared!  </li>
            <li>I have been using Phisoderm but wanted to use a product that was more natural with a baby on the way.  </li>
            <li>I just had to make sure it was completely washed off my face.</li>
            <li>Many have said that an all natural cleanser shouldn&#x27;t have fragrance added.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling fresh and moisturized every time.</li>
            <li>Good quality face wash - like the convenient pump; does not dry skin out - gentle yet very efficient with getting skin clean.</li>
            <li>Given all the great reviews, I really wanted to like this product, but I don&#x27;t know if I will be able to stand the aroma long enough to see if it works!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather up like other soaps but my derm told me that&#x27;s actually a good thing because the sulfates that create lather are damaging to the skin</li>
            <li>it really makes my skin feel clean too.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I feel like it takes twice as much to get my face completely clean.</li>
            <li>I really like how clean I feel after using it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soooooo soft feeling, leaves your face super soft and smells really nice.</li>
            <li>I have bigger pores than most people and oily/combination skin with mild breakouts.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like your typical burts bees product (not that they don&#x27;t smell good,</li>
            <li>it smells nice and wont dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s never damaging or drying to my dry patches yet effectively cleans my oily areas.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle and creamy feeling.</li>
            <li>This facial cleanser is very smooth.</li>
            <li>Easy to open packaging, quick shipping,</li>
            <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products, especially this face wash.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and have recently combined it with Egyptian cream.</li>
            <li>really creamy texture,removes dirt(im a rancher!)makeup,even waterproof mascara!</li>
            <li>I have tried many facial cleansers.</li>
            <li>Not the first time this has happened........</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the facial cleanser from aldi, and this stuff worked better the first time</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and smooth, and not a zit to be found.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using BB lip stuff for ages, but this is the first skin care item I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>i never break out and this was pretty instantaneous.</li>
            <li>only thing that could make this product better for me is the smell--</li>
            <li>The vintagey colors, with the pretty borders surrounding the logo.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Clean, soft and fresh ready for moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product to help remove make up and because it was made from natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my face soft and still clean.</li>
            <li>I really like this face wash, I feel like my skin is more even after using it regularly.</li>
            <li>I also wanted a product that looked and smelled a little prettier to make me more excited about washing my face in the morning.</li>
            <li>I have mild keratosis pilaris on my arms and some on my face near my jaw.</li>
            <li>This facial cleanser cleans effectively but does not dry the skin nor cause it to shine.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a mild, natural, moisturizing cleanser that would not dry out my skin, but still clean it.  </li>
            <li>It really does the job.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very perfumed - in fact, so much so that I&#x27;m considering returning it.</li>
            <li>I really like Burt&#x27;s Bees and this cleanser</li>
            <li>It was gentle yet cleansed very well.  </li>
            <li>Gentle but thorough cleansing.</li>
            <li>i really like this cleanser</li>
            <li>Its taste is very fragrant.</li>
            <li>Because  it is really like in the face with royal jelly.</li>
            <li>I have seen much improvement in my face/neck appearance.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft and fresh feeling.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>it makes me wonder what&#x27;s really in this face wash?</li>
            <li>/&gt;- GENTLE</li>
            <li>It removes makeup really well, too.</li>
            <li>and sometimes I thought it was drying up my forehead too much,</li>
            <li>Very drying on your face.  </li>
            <li>then many times of using the other stuff.</li>
            <li>Also, I find that I have to use a second soap to fully clean off my makeup.</li>
            <li>I personally prefer non-foaming cleansers, but there is a problem in the world of cream cleansers where your face does not always feel particularly clean after using one (in my experience).</li>
            <li>: It&#x27;s mostly natural and very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Helps me to remove anything from my face, I don&#x27;t usually use makeup remover when I cleanse my face with this because it honestly does that for me.</li>
            <li>and I really needed a new cleanser.</li>
            <li>This is the only facial cleanser that I use, and I love it.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ll never buy high end again</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I really rely on my natural skin to keep me presentable.</li>
            <li>Gentle, natural and cleans well.</li>
            <li>Do be warned tho, it really does hurt when this product goes anywhere near your eyes..</li>
            <li>In my opinion much better than cetaphil and a few others that are marketed that way.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I love that the ingredients aren&#x27;t harsh or harmful.</li>
            <li>but I sure as hell was my face with this stuff everyday.</li>
            <li>Before purchasing, i looked at countless of reviews to see how it rating, and to see if this product was right for me.</li>
            <li>Fantastic cleanser, I didn&#x27;t know Burt&#x27;s Bee made these other products</li>
            <li>But the cleanser is great for my skin (so far) ill see in about a week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for about 2 weeks now only at night and my face is starting to feel so smooth.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>my skin is very soft.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>So far, no breakouts!  </li>
            <li>I felt like this product was a bit drying to my skin and that my skin seemed to be a bit more pimply than usual after using this product.</li>
            <li>I am going back to Avon anew clinical cleanser, it leaves my skin feeling better than any other cleanser</li>
            <li>It went back to doing exactly what it was supposed to.</li>
            <li>My skin is very oily, and I have been lookng for some time now a facial cleanser that not just make my skin feel fresh when I use it, but a long time after that.</li>
            <li>Although this face wash doesn&#x27;t completely clear my skin, it does give it somewhat of a natural shine, and makes it incredibly soft while getting the job done.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and everything makes me break out.</li>
            <li>I work at a drugstore and have tried nearly every cleanser out there.  </li>
            <li>Also it makes my face feel oil, but almost like a natural oil that I&#x27;d been scrubbing away all these years.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s soft .</li>
            <li>do far.</li>
            <li>No chemical with soft skin.</li>
            <li>The cleanser is milky and leaves my skin soft after washing.</li>
            <li>No heavy residue afterwards.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I have oily, acne-prone skin, but at 42 years old I&#x27;m also facing some signs of aging.  </li>
            <li>and my face feels soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>THIS CLEANSER MAKES MY SKIN SOFT AND GLOWY.</li>
            <li>This by far is its strongest selling point.</li>
            <li>and I do not have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin type: Combination, Sensitive</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, so this was a worry for me.</li>
            <li>If your a person that has sensitive skin, that almost reddens from anything.</li>
            <li>I thought Burt&#x27;s Bees was supposed to be natural, but now I wonder.  </li>
            <li>, I use all the chapsticks, and now i am using the Radiance line to reduce dark spots and uneven skin tone, I am loving it so far!</li>
            <li>Completely removed make up with out harshness.&lt;br /&gt;- slightly drying (I have more dry type skin though) but</li>
            <li>This is my carefully chosen, although I haven&#x27;t started to use, but I like it very much,</li>
            <li>Being my first natural product, it todes make my face feel nice and soft, but the texture is still bad.</li>
            <li>It takes my makeup off (fuller coverage Clinique, or very cling-heavy mineral powder) but doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>As for the scent of this, let me just set the record straight and say that once you start applying it on your face, it does smell kinda weird but its not an overwhelming sort of smell.</li>
            <li>I could wipe with a cotton ball and mild astringent after and see the make up remains of what should have been removed...and I don&#x27;t wear heavy makeup.  </li>
            <li>Be forewarned, this is strong-smelling stuff (and I&#x27;m not usually bothered by such things).</li>
            <li>Barely any breakouts at all, and everyone comments on how radiant my skin looks.  </li>
            <li>It left my skin soft after cleansing.  </li>
            <li>Definitely did not leave my skin feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is the strong smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised that in all these glowing reviews, no one has mentioned how STRONG the smell of this facial wash is- and not necessarily a pleasant one.</li>
            <li>I use other products from this line and absolutely luv this line.</li>
            <li>I am a 48-year old female with combination skin that has occasional acne.  </li>
            <li>So make sure you really wash it off, and finish by splashing somewhat cold water on your face.</li>
            <li>It does dry out my skin a little, but as long as I moisturize it&#x27;s fine.</li>

            <li> Impressed with the gentle cleansing power of this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be honest, I wanted to buy this cleanser because of its packaging.</li>

            <li> nice scent, cleans well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mild and works great.</li>

            <li> Overall great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, gets my face nice and clean with out drying it out.</li>

            <li> I love</li>
            <li> I love many of Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell, ease of use and the way my skin feels after I use it.</li>
            <li> Incidently, I notice that my skin is moist and takes product a bit better.  </li>
            <li> I am much more confident since I don&#x27;t wear makeup</li>
            <li> I decided to try Burts bees radiance cleanser hoping for something better based on the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Great facial soap with a good price on amazon.</li>
            <li> Love the pump design.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not attesting some phenomenal results here on a difference in my skin, but I think it works well</li>
            <li> I love this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s interesting that I can \\&quot;feel\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I bought this at Target because I love BB</li>
            <li> and I love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I use this at night after washing with a more stringent cleaner.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I love the smell</li>
            <li> One of the best facial cleansers ever.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lathers up more than Cetaphyl (or any of those non-soap cleansers), but just a touch.</li>
            <li> Many comments Ive seen about this product are about the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> The cleanser may work fine, but I&#x27;m so distracted by the fragrance, and want it away from my face so quickly, that I can&#x27;t say much good about it.</li>
            <li> This is amazing cleanse my face just right!</li>
            <li> It has a very peculiar smell that is not at all pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Glad I can easily find it online</li>
            <li> and my face looks and feels more smooth and refreshed than ever.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smell so good, feel really nature, and it&#x27;s works well</li>
            <li> Takes off make up easy.  </li>
            <li> YES, the fragrance is a bit strong, but</li>
            <li> The scent is WAY too strong, smells like shampoo, squirts out too forcefully from the container, and has the consistency of...</li>
            <li> This is a very gentle yet effective cleanser.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very gentle and effective).</li>
            <li> I really liked this face wash the first hour I used it</li>
            <li> Hands down the best cleanser I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> but this is exceptional - truly feels high end.</li>
            <li> If I could design my own soap and figure out how much lather to put into it, this would be the sweet spot!</li>
            <li> The smell is not unpleasant, though it&#x27;s not my favorite either.</li>
            <li> It has these little scrubby balls that are perfect for the exfoliation and circulation of your skin.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s a huge plus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for: a reasonably priced, natural face skincare routine that, at minimum, does not cause breakouts, and ideally clears me up and keeps all types of acne</li>
            <li> I started purchasing it here because it was no longer available where I work.  </li>
            <li> this stuff made my face feel so smooth after using for a week.</li>
            <li> Initially I thought that this was going to be great.  </li>
            <li> Great facial cleanser for women 50</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t care much for the smell it smells kind of smells like milk.</li>
            <li> It is gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE SMELL OF IT, IT SMELLS FRESH AND JUST SOOTHING IN A WAY.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this keeps my face feeling clean and removes my makeup easily, so I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and refreshing for an everyday wash.</li>
            <li> It gets my face clean, removes make-up and gives me smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> It has a unique smell but doesn&#x27;t linger after use.</li>
            <li> I love the whole Radiance line!  </li>
            <li> My skin feels clean after washing my face with this product.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t thoroughly clean my face -</li>
            <li> I found it to clean my skin</li>
            <li> I found it to give a squeaky clean feeling that was bit drying.</li>
            <li> It rinses clean.</li>
            <li> CLEAN AND LEAVE MY SKIN</li>
            <li> Fresh, clean, lightly fragranced.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was really getting clean, but I have not had any flare-ups of acne.  </li>
            <li> Nice on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> so much, I did the monthly subscribe and save. :)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really want to spend money at Sephora or Nordstrom to find an alternative, and I am so pleased with the quality, experience, and price of this</li>
            <li> closed easily which is good for travel.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> I had previously bought Burts bees intense hydration which is pretty good with acceptable ingredients and a good smell, however I was looking for something better/more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Clean fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> Keep my skin fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> Cleans my face quickly and thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I am going to look into more radiance products in this line because this is the second product in the line I love.</li>
            <li> I really like the facial cleanser, it takes all of my eye makeup off with 1 application and it smells great.</li>
            <li> but then my face became super oily.</li>
            <li> At any rate, I was concerned that it would be too mild and not leave my skin clean-feeling, or that I would have oily breakouts.  </li>
            <li> It smells really good, it has the distinct smell of the royal jelly, similar to the day and night creme.</li>
            <li> I love this product and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> In fact, I am using the entire radiance line &amp; I love it!</li>
            <li> (I guess one benefit of a lifetime of oily skin is that I was 40 before my first lines appeared!  </li>
            <li> I have been using Phisoderm but wanted to use a product that was more natural with a baby on the way.  </li>
            <li> I just had to make sure it was completely washed off my face.</li>
            <li> Many have said that an all natural cleanser shouldn&#x27;t have fragrance added.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling fresh and moisturized every time.</li>
            <li> Good quality face wash - like the convenient pump; does not dry skin out - gentle yet very efficient with getting skin clean.</li>
            <li> Given all the great reviews, I really wanted to like this product, but I don&#x27;t know if I will be able to stand the aroma long enough to see if it works!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather up like other soaps but my derm told me that&#x27;s actually a good thing because the sulfates that create lather are damaging to the skin</li>
            <li> it really makes my skin feel clean too.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I feel like it takes twice as much to get my face completely clean.</li>
            <li> I really like how clean I feel after using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soooooo soft feeling, leaves your face super soft and smells really nice.</li>
            <li> I have bigger pores than most people and oily/combination skin with mild breakouts.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like your typical burts bees product (not that they don&#x27;t smell good,</li>
            <li> it smells nice and wont dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s never damaging or drying to my dry patches yet effectively cleans my oily areas.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle and creamy feeling.</li>
            <li> This facial cleanser is very smooth.</li>
            <li> Easy to open packaging, quick shipping,</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products, especially this face wash.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and have recently combined it with Egyptian cream.</li>
            <li> really creamy texture,removes dirt(im a rancher!)makeup,even waterproof mascara!</li>
            <li> I have tried many facial cleansers.</li>
            <li> Not the first time this has happened........</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the facial cleanser from aldi, and this stuff worked better the first time</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and smooth, and not a zit to be found.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using BB lip stuff for ages, but this is the first skin care item I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> i never break out and this was pretty instantaneous.</li>
            <li> only thing that could make this product better for me is the smell--</li>
            <li> The vintagey colors, with the pretty borders surrounding the logo.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Clean, soft and fresh ready for moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product to help remove make up and because it was made from natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my face soft and still clean.</li>
            <li> I really like this face wash, I feel like my skin is more even after using it regularly.</li>
            <li> I also wanted a product that looked and smelled a little prettier to make me more excited about washing my face in the morning.</li>
            <li> I have mild keratosis pilaris on my arms and some on my face near my jaw.</li>
            <li> This facial cleanser cleans effectively but does not dry the skin nor cause it to shine.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a mild, natural, moisturizing cleanser that would not dry out my skin, but still clean it.  </li>
            <li> It really does the job.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very perfumed - in fact, so much so that I&#x27;m considering returning it.</li>
            <li> I really like Burt&#x27;s Bees and this cleanser</li>
            <li> It was gentle yet cleansed very well.  </li>
            <li> Gentle but thorough cleansing.</li>
            <li> i really like this cleanser</li>
            <li> Its taste is very fragrant.</li>
            <li> Because  it is really like in the face with royal jelly.</li>
            <li> I have seen much improvement in my face/neck appearance.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft and fresh feeling.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> it makes me wonder what&#x27;s really in this face wash?</li>
            <li> /&gt;- GENTLE</li>
            <li> It removes makeup really well, too.</li>
            <li> and sometimes I thought it was drying up my forehead too much,</li>
            <li> Very drying on your face.  </li>
            <li> then many times of using the other stuff.</li>
            <li> Also, I find that I have to use a second soap to fully clean off my makeup.</li>
            <li> I personally prefer non-foaming cleansers, but there is a problem in the world of cream cleansers where your face does not always feel particularly clean after using one (in my experience).</li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s mostly natural and very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Helps me to remove anything from my face, I don&#x27;t usually use makeup remover when I cleanse my face with this because it honestly does that for me.</li>
            <li> and I really needed a new cleanser.</li>
            <li> This is the only facial cleanser that I use, and I love it.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ll never buy high end again</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I really rely on my natural skin to keep me presentable.</li>
            <li> Gentle, natural and cleans well.</li>
            <li> Do be warned tho, it really does hurt when this product goes anywhere near your eyes..</li>
            <li> In my opinion much better than cetaphil and a few others that are marketed that way.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I love that the ingredients aren&#x27;t harsh or harmful.</li>
            <li> but I sure as hell was my face with this stuff everyday.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing, i looked at countless of reviews to see how it rating, and to see if this product was right for me.</li>
            <li> Fantastic cleanser, I didn&#x27;t know Burt&#x27;s Bee made these other products</li>
            <li> But the cleanser is great for my skin (so far) ill see in about a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for about 2 weeks now only at night and my face is starting to feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to smells</li>
            <li> my skin is very soft.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and</li>
            <li> So far, no breakouts!  </li>
            <li> I felt like this product was a bit drying to my skin and that my skin seemed to be a bit more pimply than usual after using this product.</li>
            <li> I am going back to Avon anew clinical cleanser, it leaves my skin feeling better than any other cleanser</li>
            <li> It went back to doing exactly what it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> My skin is very oily, and I have been lookng for some time now a facial cleanser that not just make my skin feel fresh when I use it, but a long time after that.</li>
            <li> Although this face wash doesn&#x27;t completely clear my skin, it does give it somewhat of a natural shine, and makes it incredibly soft while getting the job done.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and everything makes me break out.</li>
            <li> I work at a drugstore and have tried nearly every cleanser out there.  </li>
            <li> Also it makes my face feel oil, but almost like a natural oil that I&#x27;d been scrubbing away all these years.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s soft .</li>
            <li> do far.</li>
            <li> No chemical with soft skin.</li>
            <li> The cleanser is milky and leaves my skin soft after washing.</li>
            <li> No heavy residue afterwards.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I have oily, acne-prone skin, but at 42 years old I&#x27;m also facing some signs of aging.  </li>
            <li> and my face feels soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> THIS CLEANSER MAKES MY SKIN SOFT AND GLOWY.</li>
            <li> This by far is its strongest selling point.</li>
            <li> and I do not have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin type: Combination, Sensitive</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so this was a worry for me.</li>
            <li> If your a person that has sensitive skin, that almost reddens from anything.</li>
            <li> I thought Burt&#x27;s Bees was supposed to be natural, but now I wonder.  </li>
            <li> , I use all the chapsticks, and now i am using the Radiance line to reduce dark spots and uneven skin tone, I am loving it so far!</li>
            <li> Completely removed make up with out harshness.&lt;br /&gt;- slightly drying (I have more dry type skin though) but</li>
            <li> This is my carefully chosen, although I haven&#x27;t started to use, but I like it very much,</li>
            <li> Being my first natural product, it todes make my face feel nice and soft, but the texture is still bad.</li>
            <li> It takes my makeup off (fuller coverage Clinique, or very cling-heavy mineral powder) but doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> As for the scent of this, let me just set the record straight and say that once you start applying it on your face, it does smell kinda weird but its not an overwhelming sort of smell.</li>
            <li> I could wipe with a cotton ball and mild astringent after and see the make up remains of what should have been removed...and I don&#x27;t wear heavy makeup.  </li>
            <li> Be forewarned, this is strong-smelling stuff (and I&#x27;m not usually bothered by such things).</li>
            <li> Barely any breakouts at all, and everyone comments on how radiant my skin looks.  </li>
            <li> It left my skin soft after cleansing.  </li>
            <li> Definitely did not leave my skin feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is the strong smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised that in all these glowing reviews, no one has mentioned how STRONG the smell of this facial wash is- and not necessarily a pleasant one.</li>
            <li> I use other products from this line and absolutely luv this line.</li>
            <li> I am a 48-year old female with combination skin that has occasional acne.  </li>
            <li> So make sure you really wash it off, and finish by splashing somewhat cold water on your face.</li>
            <li> It does dry out my skin a little, but as long as I moisturize it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> This sloughs off dead dry skin but not in an abrasive or chemical burn way - more like enzymes that eat away skin (not really sure how to explain this</li>
            <li> For so long Ive wanted this cleanser, and i finally got it.</li>
            <li> It last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> Also, because I have sensitive skin, I sort of get this slight burning sensation (like when you put toner on).</li>
            <li> Since starting using this product, I have not had one single breakout.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t caused any skin reactions (I am not very sensitive except with makeup), and my acne seems under some semblance of control.</li>
            <li> This works very well though it&#x27;s not completely effective at removing eye makeup.</li>
            <li> boyfriend&#x27;s skin is sensitive and prone to breakouts, and he also loves it as an everyday cleanser (he uses a separate, medicated soap when his skin breaks out).</li>
            <li> I had been using Cetaphyl for a long time, and while it moisturized my skin well, it never got any of my makeup off.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve used it for so long that it&#x27;s unnoticeable to me now).</li>
            <li> And I have very dry combination skin, and live in Colorado where the sun is harsh, the wind whips, and the air is</li>
            <li> I was worried that this would leave my face &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;, but I have actually found it cleans and removes my make up (only a little blush &amp; concealer) quite well.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin or break out...</li>
            <li> and I find my skin is dry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, but seems to help maintain complexion.</li>
            <li> I have skin that is dry in the cheeks and oily on the chin.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and washes off without leaving a residue that i can detect.</li>
            <li> dry dry</li>
            <li> But I think this is what helps dry out the pimples</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not even that sensitive to smell, but it&#x27;s weird when an all-natural product smells that intense...</li>
            <li> No new blackheads.</li>
            <li> The odor was so overwhelming, unpleasant and lingering that I had to wash my face again with soap to get it off.  </li>
            <li> I have one tiny &#x27;hole&#x27;, a scar from chicken pox, that is even becoming less noticeable.</li>
            <li> While my skin is normal to oily, I have trouble getting dried out in the winter.  </li>
            <li> I have used this cleanser for about a week and a half, twice daily.  </li>
            <li> I used to use the boscia face wash, but at almost three times the price for less product, I eventually switched entirely to the Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> I also suggest following the directions and avoiding the eye area as it did seem to sting a little around the eyes when I used it there.  </li>
            <li> I spent a while cross-referencing PETA&#x27;s website for animal-friendly products with the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s \\&quot;Skin Deep\\&quot; site which ranks products based on toxicity, and landed on this facewash.  </li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> EVEN IF THEY ARE CLOSED.</li>
            <li> Just as I expected.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have oily or bad skin prone to breakouts, so I don&#x27;t need a strong, harsh facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> Bye Bye Other brand that are heavily perfumed and NOT natural.</li>
            <li> If you want a creamy cleanser to use with a washcloth, try the other Burt&#x27;s products like the probiotic one, or the soap bark.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t strip like other kid cleansers can.</li>
            <li> I can see some other people have reacted to the smell</li>
            <li> This product is being discontinued along with the other Radiance too.</li>
            <li> This does not clean my skin as well as I would have expected.</li>
            <li> (I have a rough uneven skin texture) 6/8/15</li>
            <li> As I worked it into my face, I LITERALLY FELT the bump go down beneath my fingers.</li>
            <li> hope it won&#x27;t let me down.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait for my other Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance products to come!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and usually use a cream cleanser with no lather.  </li>
            <li> Typically I like Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s products</li>
            <li> It can leave a slight drying feel.</li>
            <li> I typically get ~2 pimples per month.</li>
            <li> I started using nighttime moisturizer (I typically don&#x27;t like moisturizers because they seem to make my skin greasy) and the problems stopped immediately.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was due to the fragrance irritating the skin or my skin being sensitive as usual.</li>
            <li> Tried it for a few weeks think maybe I just had to get used to it</li>
            <li> I may not shower everyday</li>
            <li> My skin is not great with them, and I have had a minor breakout.</li>
            <li> It is a little hard to rinse off.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did not read the reviews before purchasing and was totally revolted by the smell of this product.  </li>
            <li> it on my skin - not sure what that means.  </li>
            <li> whatever cleanser I used in the past would break me out.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like drug store skin care</li>
            <li> When I received it, I was a little surprised and disappointed to see how small and slim the bottle was.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s getting so hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> So for all those bad comments about the smell.. maybe they&#x27;ve just got really sensitive noses.</li>
            <li> It smells so artificial and gross.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a thick, creamy face wash, this is not it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it just does not clean well.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for hot cloth cleansing and it&#x27;s a terrible choice.</li>
            <li> But sometimes I feel like it leaves behind some of my makeup.  </li>
            <li> This cleanser got rid of all my spots (you know those painful little bumps we sometimes get) in one wash.</li>
            <li> I wish I noticed a perfume-y or shampoo-like smell, unfortunately, this smells like hair dye to me.  </li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this one is not for me.  </li>
            <li> Although there is nothing wrong with this product, I am looking for something better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No need to buy expensive &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; brands.</li>
            <li> Cloying, weird smell.</li>
            <li> and I even prefer this texture anyway, it feels slippery and expensive.   </li>
            <li> As is, the fragrance isn&#x27;t bad at all, just a bit neutral.</li>
            <li> As someone who is struggling with cystic acne (for those who know what that is, it is absolutely horrible and extremely difficult to cure)</li>
            <li> No chemical crap which ages and no funky stuff which is bad for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There is, however, a creamy base and if you are prone to breaking out using creamy cleansers, then this may not be for you.</li>
            <li> but actually I hate that part</li>
            <li> NOT THAT BAD!  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this purchase.</li>
            <li> The smell is disgusting, couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this cleanser. It&#x27;s very gentle and creamy feeling. My store stopped carrying it, so I ordered through Amazon. I&#x27;ll keep using it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review becoaus i couldn&#x27;t add a photo on the Q&amp;A.&lt;br /&gt;I bought two of burt&#x27;s bees radiance facial cleaser and found the item has the date number as B0150511C and B0150511C.&lt;br /&gt;Let me know the production date the items. Please refer  to added photo.</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products, especially this face wash.  The product shipped and arrived on time, so thank you to the merchant for that. The Radiance Facial Cleanser smells wonderful and it works great to remove eye make up. I originally bought this product to help remove make up and because it was made from natural ingredients.  The royal jelly day creme also works well too!</li>
            <li> My skin feels clean after washing my face with this product.  It really does the job.  I use other products from this line and absolutely luv this line.</li>
            <li> We love this cleanser. It&#x27;s mild and works great. It doesn&#x27;t have a smell we can&#x27;t stand so that&#x27;s a huge plus. My husband&#x27;s skin has never been clearer.</li>
            <li> I agree with others on the smell. It has a very peculiar smell that is not at all pleasant.  Also, I find that I have to use a second soap to fully clean off my makeup. This does not clean my skin as well as I would have expected. Very disappointed in this purchase. I will tolerate it to finish the bottle but I won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and refreshing for an everyday wash. I have sensitive skin and everything makes me break out. Not this! Smells good and leaves my skin very smooth!</li>
            <li> Great deal on Amazon, Stores sell it for 3 or 4 dollars more. I like this product line, I use all the chapsticks, and now i am using the Radiance line to reduce dark spots and uneven skin tone, I am loving it so far!</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I wish I noticed a perfume-y or shampoo-like smell, unfortunately, this smells like hair dye to me.  I will finish the bottle (I think), but am too bothered by the smell to buy it again.  Function-wise, I have dry-ish skin, and it seems to work well, but is nothing impressive.</li>
            <li> I love it. I wish it were easier to find.</li>
            <li> I work at a drugstore and have tried nearly every cleanser out there.  While my skin is normal to oily, I have trouble getting dried out in the winter.  Never had an issue with this one and I don&#x27;t feel oily in the summer either.  I started purchasing it here because it was no longer available where I work.  It has a unique smell but doesn&#x27;t linger after use.</li>
            <li> Cleans my face quickly and thoroughly. Put on Burt&#x27;s Bees Brightening even-tone moisturizing cream afterwards and I am set  for bed.  Use the cleanser in the morning as well and apply the Burt&#x27;s Bees Repair Serum under my makeup. So far, no breakouts!  That has kept me from trying any product on the market for years.  Thank you to Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t thoroughly clean my face - has lead to breakouts when I use it.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have recently combined it with Egyptian cream.</li>
            <li> Cleans well without reside left on your face.</li>
            <li> I love my skin after using this cleanser. My wrinkles are gone. I don&#x27;t like the smell, but the smell washes away. I am very sensitive to smells so it is very important to me not to smell the cleanser after.</li>
            <li> The smell is disgusting, couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Love Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
            <li> I have used this cleanser for about a week and a half, twice daily.  I ALWAYS moisturize with an spf during the day and the burts bees night cream at night.  YES, the fragrance is a bit strong, but NOT THAT BAD!  It gets my face clean, removes make-up and gives me smooth skin.  I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> This is amazing cleanse my face just right! I love it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin or break out... Takes off makeup too I love it! And the night cream is awesome as well</li>
            <li> Typically I like Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s products and I especially like the Radiance royal jelly face serum so I anticipated that I would like the cleanser too.  Unfortunately, I did not read the reviews before purchasing and was totally revolted by the smell of this product.  The odor was so overwhelming, unpleasant and lingering that I had to wash my face again with soap to get it off.  It also felt like it left a film on my skin.  Cannot recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Smells great and keeps your skin so smooth after washes.  Although you may need to wash twice to remove excess makeup.</li>
            <li> I felt this product cleaned well enough. I felt like this product was a bit drying to my skin and that my skin seemed to be a bit more pimply than usual after using this product. Not sure if it was due to the fragrance irritating the skin or my skin being sensitive as usual. I won&#x27;t be buying this product again for myself.</li>
            <li> Barely any breakouts at all, and everyone comments on how radiant my skin looks.  Also it makes my face feel oil, but almost like a natural oil that I&#x27;d been scrubbing away all these years.</li>
            <li> I have bigger pores than most people and oily/combination skin with mild breakouts.  this stuff made my face feel so smooth after using for a week. it really makes my skin feel clean too. I like to use it in combination with the deep pore scrub that they have.</li>
            <li> This works very well though it&#x27;s not completely effective at removing eye makeup. It can leave a slight drying feel. I use moisturizer afterward.</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible. Hands down the best cleanser I&#x27;ve used. I have mild keratosis pilaris on my arms and some on my face near my jaw. I use this as a night cleanser and my face looks and feels more smooth and refreshed than ever. In case you&#x27;re wondering, there is a huge difference! It lasts for about 2 days too! It does dry out my skin a little, but as long as I moisturize it&#x27;s fine. Overall great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> I bought this from Burt&#x27;s Bees thinking that it would be great, with a mild fragrance. Boy was I wrong. It&#x27;s very perfumed - in fact, so much so that I&#x27;m considering returning it. The cleanser may work fine, but I&#x27;m so distracted by the fragrance, and want it away from my face so quickly, that I can&#x27;t say much good about it. Be forewarned, this is strong-smelling stuff (and I&#x27;m not usually bothered by such things).</li>
            <li> I so wish I liked this product!  I spent a while cross-referencing PETA&#x27;s website for animal-friendly products with the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s \\&quot;Skin Deep\\&quot; site which ranks products based on toxicity, and landed on this facewash.  I love many of Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  Unfortunately, this one is not for me.  The scent is WAY too strong, smells like shampoo, squirts out too forcefully from the container, and has the consistency of...well...something else that squirts out, but from a male person.  No thanks.</li>
            <li> I really like Burt&#x27;s Bees and this cleanser did not disappoint.  It was gentle yet cleansed very well.  I am going to look into more radiance products in this line because this is the second product in the line I love.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, ease of use and the way my skin feels after I use it. Clean, soft and fresh ready for moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Took a while to get used to.  I have been using Phisoderm but wanted to use a product that was more natural with a baby on the way.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was really getting clean, but I have not had any flare-ups of acne.  I now see that it was simply not drying out my skin.  Incidently, I notice that my skin is moist and takes product a bit better.  I am much more confident since I don&#x27;t wear makeup I really rely on my natural skin to keep me presentable.</li>
            <li> Has a weird scent, cleans the skin okay, but I won&#x27;t purchase it again. Only used 1/2 the bottle and gave up because I had to hold my breath until I rinsed it off.</li>
            <li> Gentle but thorough cleansing. Nice on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> really creamy texture,removes dirt(im a rancher!)makeup,even waterproof mascara!</li>
            <li> i really like this cleanser, it&#x27;s soft .</li>
            <li> The best, even for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> About me: -Asian -teenager -oily acne prone skin -not sensitive&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;m looking for: a reasonably priced, natural face skincare routine that, at minimum, does not cause breakouts, and ideally clears me up and keeps all types of acne away.&lt;br /&gt;What I like about this product: It&#x27;s mostly natural and very reasonably priced. It hasn&#x27;t caused any skin reactions (I am not very sensitive except with makeup), and my acne seems under some semblance of control. Being my first natural product, it todes make my face feel nice and soft, but the texture is still bad. The pump-squirt bottle is convenient, and it locks closed easily which is good for travel.&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t dislike: The smell is not unpleasant, though it&#x27;s not my favorite either. It&#x27;s not a lingering smell, only when you put it on.&lt;br /&gt;What I dislike: The product claims to have exfoliating jojoba beads, but although I can feel some on my hands, I never feel them on my face; there aren&#x27;t enough to do anything. Although there is nothing wrong with this product, I am looking for something better.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: It&#x27;s a nice cleanser to have and try to see if it works for you. It doesn&#x27;t seem to cause any reactions, and it may do good for you. For me though, I am looking for something more effective.</li>
            <li> Initially I thought that this was going to be great.  I was looking for a mild, natural, moisturizing cleanser that would not dry out my skin, but still clean it.  It did have a nice scent.  It left my skin soft after cleansing.  Unfortunately, it just does not clean well.  I could wipe with a cotton ball and mild astringent after and see the make up remains of what should have been removed...and I don&#x27;t wear heavy makeup.  (mineral powder only)  On the bright side getting a refund was no problem at all.</li>
            <li> This is the only facial cleanser that I use, and I love it.</li>
            <li> I personally prefer non-foaming cleansers, but there is a problem in the world of cream cleansers where your face does not always feel particularly clean after using one (in my experience). That is not the case here. In addition to cleansing effectively, it smells amazing and wakes me up in the morning. It is not overdrying at all, yet does not leave a film on my face or anything. I am using it in conjunction with a Clarisonic Pro and it seems to be working great. my skin is very soft.</li>
            <li> Easy to open packaging, quick shipping, the product I was looking for. I love almost everything from Burts bees but this face wash is awesome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 50 and I find my skin is dry. I have tried many facial cleansers. I had previously bought Burts bees intense hydration which is pretty good with acceptable ingredients and a good smell, however I was looking for something better/more moisturizing. I decided to try Burts bees radiance cleanser hoping for something better based on the ingredients. I found it to clean my skin well but there are lots of cleansers that can do that. I found it to give a squeaky clean feeling that was bit drying. Definitely did not leave my skin feeling soft and moisturized. I am going back to Avon anew clinical cleanser, it leaves my skin feeling better than any other cleanser do far.</li>
            <li> As a senior, my face needs all the help it can get.  Has made a big difference in texture and cleans without drying out.  Only facial cleanser I use now.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a thick, creamy face wash, this is not it. It&#x27;s very runny in consistency and is messy to work with. Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I feel like it takes twice as much to get my face completely clean. I&#x27;m not a fan of the way it lathers, and won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> Fantastic cleanser, I didn&#x27;t know Burt&#x27;s Bee made these other products, I&#x27;ll never buy high end again</li>
            <li> No chemical with soft skin.</li>
            <li> I have Rosacea, and nothing prescription or OTC helped. I bought the Burt&#x27;s Bees for the sunscreen but soon discovered it helped the redness and burning. Not 100% but enough that I use it 2 x daily.</li>
            <li> LOVE!love!love!&lt;br /&gt;Smell so good, feel really nature, and it&#x27;s works well</li>
            <li> As someone who is struggling with cystic acne (for those who know what that is, it is absolutely horrible and extremely difficult to cure) I have used just about everything. Although this face wash doesn&#x27;t completely clear my skin, it does give it somewhat of a natural shine, and makes it incredibly soft while getting the job done.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is amazing! I don&#x27;t know why. Must be the royal jelly? I don&#x27;t know. But it has changed my complexion. It cleanses without stripping. It doesn&#x27;t make a lot of leather... I think that is a good thing. It doesn&#x27;t smell so great... I DON&#x27;T CARE LOL It works! It has reduced the appearance of my pores. I have one tiny &#x27;hole&#x27;, a scar from chicken pox, that is even becoming less noticeable. My skin has never felt this good. And I&#x27;m 53! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This facial cleanser is very smooth.Its taste is very fragrant. When  I use it, I feel very happy. Because  it is really like in the face with royal jelly.So i should buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great facial cleanser for women 50+. I have seen much improvement in my face/neck appearance. In fact, I am using the entire radiance line &amp; I love it! Not too heavy--although the night cream is richer than the day cream.</li>
            <li> Great soap, but the pump did not work.  Will not order again.  Not the first time this has happened........Fool me once shame on you.  Fool me twice shame on me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the facial cleanser from aldi, and this stuff worked better the first time then many times of using the other stuff. Got lots of dirt out of my pores in my nose and left my face shiny</li>
            <li> The smell is very pleasant and fresh! I really like how clean I feel after using it.There is, however, a creamy base and if you are prone to breaking out using creamy cleansers, then this may not be for you. My skin is not great with them, and I have had a minor breakout. I like the ingredients and the Burt&#x27;s Bees brand, so I&#x27;ll give it time and hope that my skin adjusts.</li>
            <li> I really like the facial cleanser, it takes all of my eye makeup off with 1 application and it smells great.</li>
            <li> Great facial soap with a good price on amazon.</li>
            <li> The cleanser is milky and leaves my skin soft after washing. But it leaves a residue on my face. It doesn&#x27;t lather up, its like putting a cream on your face and then wash it out.  I think it says something about being a scrub as well but actually I hate that part it seems like milk curds to me which makes me feel like it is spoiled but this is subjective I think. I also don&#x27;t care much for the smell it smells kind of smells like milk.</li>
            <li> I love the whole Radiance line!  It&#x27;s light and non-greasy - perfect for my skin!</li>
            <li> Good price!  Great product and it&#x27;s getting so hard to find in stores. Glad I can easily find it online</li>
            <li> Great product. I typically get ~2 pimples per month. Since starting using this product, I have not had one single breakout. My skin feels softer and glows.</li>
            <li> I really liked this face wash the first hour I used it but then my face became super oily. Tried it for a few weeks think maybe I just had to get used to it but the oil just keeps appearing. If you have oily/combo  skin I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My favorite soap! My skin can be sensitive and this is one soap that is just perfect for my skin. Cleans perfectly without over drying my skin. Love the pump design. Great pricing too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not attesting some phenomenal results here on a difference in my skin, but I think it works well and I like the smell of the cleanser.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, but seems to help maintain complexion.</li>
            <li> Clean fresh feeling. No heavy residue afterwards. No need to buy expensive &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; brands. I use in conjunction with Burt&#x27;s Bee day/night cream. I can see my a glow to my face. I love this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using Burt&#x27;s bee after having severe chapped lips. I tried everything. So I decided to try Burt&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Bee. Their Chapstick worked so well I wanted to try facial&lt;br /&gt;Products. I just wished I started using Burt&#x27;s Bee years ago. My kids and babies use Burt&#x27;s Bee. Bye Bye Other brand that are heavily perfumed and NOT natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this face wash for several years now.  It is gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and usually use a cream cleanser with no lather.  But sometimes I feel like it leaves behind some of my makeup.  This cleanser lathers and removes all my makeup without drying out my skin.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this cleanser.  I am a 48-year old female with combination skin that has occasional acne.  I was worried that this would leave my face &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;, but I have actually found it cleans and removes my make up (only a little blush &amp; concealer) quite well.  Leaves my skin soft and fresh feeling.  I use a wash cloth and warm/hot water.  No tightness or drying.</li>
            <li> I have oily, acne-prone skin, but at 42 years old I&#x27;m also facing some signs of aging.  (I guess one benefit of a lifetime of oily skin is that I was 40 before my first lines appeared!  I&#x27;ve also always been a stickler for sunscreen.)  At any rate, I was concerned that it would be too mild and not leave my skin clean-feeling, or that I would have oily breakouts.  Not the case!  My skin feels so soft and smooth, and not a zit to be found.  I&#x27;ve been using BB lip stuff for ages, but this is the first skin care item I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;m hooked!!</li>
            <li> I really like this face wash, I feel like my skin is more even after using it regularly.</li>
            <li> love it,I will use it forever!</li>
            <li> Helps me to remove anything from my face, I don&#x27;t usually use makeup remover when I cleanse my face with this because it honestly does that for me. It has these little scrubby balls that are perfect for the exfoliation and circulation of your skin. It smells really good, it has the distinct smell of the royal jelly, similar to the day and night creme. It last me a very long time. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> This is a very gentle yet effective cleanser. Perfect for my combination skin. The only complaint I have is the strong smell. It smells like a drug store shampoo. I&#x27;ll finish using this bottle, but probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Gentle, natural and cleans well.</li>
            <li> Cloying, weird smell. Does nothing for skin. Slimy texture. I bought this for hot cloth cleansing and it&#x27;s a terrible choice. If you want a creamy cleanser to use with a washcloth, try the other Burt&#x27;s products like the probiotic one, or the soap bark.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, gets my face nice and clean with out drying it out.</li>
            <li> This facial cleanser cleans effectively but does not dry the skin nor cause it to shine. And unlike some cleansers, it leaves no dulling film.</li>
            <li> Works great on my pre-teen. No new blackheads. Doesn&#x27;t strip like other kid cleansers can.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cleanser because it was recommended in the book \\&quot;Belli Beautiful\\&quot; as being a safer cleanser for pregnancy/nursing (and who doesn&#x27;t want a safer cleanser even without those paramaters?).  I really like it.  I have skin that is dry in the cheeks and oily on the chin.  This seems to do the trick.  It&#x27;s interesting that I can \\&quot;feel\\&quot; it on my skin - not sure what that means.  I also suggest following the directions and avoiding the eye area as it did seem to sting a little around the eyes when I used it there.  Also it smells nice.</li>
            <li> I can see some other people have reacted to the smell but i&#x27;m going to throw in my two-cents anyways. I bought this at Target because I love BB and I really needed a new cleanser. However, I should have smelled it in the store! It smells so artificial and gross. Sigh. I&#x27;ve already used it so I can&#x27;t return it. I&#x27;m just going to throw it out I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not even that sensitive to smell, but it&#x27;s weird when an all-natural product smells that intense...it makes me wonder what&#x27;s really in this face wash?</li>
            <li> i buy this regularly for my acne prone skin. doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and washes off without leaving a residue that i can detect.</li>
            <li> Fresh, clean, lightly fragranced.  I&#x27;m a guy and I love this cleanser.  It rinses clean.</li>
            <li> Cleaning effect is very good, very clean, washing the face with it</li>
            <li> I like this cleanser. I would like to buy again, but it cannot be shipped overseas now, why?</li>
            <li> I use this at night after washing with a more stringent cleaner. Leaves my face soft and still clean. Will continue using this product.</li>
            <li> Very good, gentle, thorough cleanser and my face feels soft afterwards. I don&#x27;t wear make up but it gets everything else off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend&#x27;s skin is sensitive and prone to breakouts, and he also loves it as an everyday cleanser (he uses a separate, medicated soap when his skin breaks out).</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT, I WILL NEVER USE ANOTHER CLEANSER AGAIN!!  THIS CLEANSER MAKES MY SKIN SOFT AND GLOWY. I LOVE THE SMELL OF IT, IT SMELLS FRESH AND JUST SOOTHING IN A WAY.  IT DEFINITELY REMOVES ALL OF MY MAKEUP, EYESHADOWS, MASCARA EVERYTHING.  LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> This facial cleanser is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Details:&lt;br /&gt;- It doesn&#x27;t smell like your typical burts bees product (not that they don&#x27;t smell good, but)...It smells VERY good, not at all &amp;#34;hippie&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;- Cleanses thoroughly. Completely removed make up with out harshness.&lt;br /&gt;- slightly drying (I have more dry type skin though) but not horrifically so, no peeling even drying dry dry winters.&lt;br /&gt;- GENTLE - this is probably one of its best features. In my opinion much better than cetaphil and a few others that are marketed that way.&lt;br /&gt;- Its GOOD for your skin. The ingredients in this are actually nutritive to the skin. This by far is its strongest selling point. No chemical crap which ages and no funky stuff which is bad for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it so much, I did the monthly subscribe and save. :)</li>
            <li> I have combination oily skin and this cleanser is the best. I love that the ingredients aren&#x27;t harsh or harmful. It removes makeup really well, too. I love the smell and I use it 1-2 times per day. I also have the Burt&#x27;s Bees peach willow bark exfoliating scrub and I&#x27;ll use that twice a week, it works well with this product.</li>
            <li> It is a little hard to rinse off.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! It gets the makeup off and cleans my face leaving a nice radiant shine :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this actually for awhile and sometimes I thought it was drying up my forehead too much, but then I realized it was because I wasn&#x27;t moisturizing / hydrating my face. I started using nighttime moisturizer (I typically don&#x27;t like moisturizers because they seem to make my skin greasy) and the problems stopped immediately. It went back to doing exactly what it was supposed to. I love it! :)</li>
            <li> One of the best facial cleansers ever. I have very sensitive skin and whatever cleanser I used in the past would break me out. After years of searching for the perfect cleanser, I stumbled across this and have been using it for a year. It has a nice fragrance and it leaves my skin feeling refreshed, not stripped.</li>
            <li> Good goood feel like mosturizing on the face</li>
            <li> this stuff made me break out and I do not have sensitive skin.  had to throw it away.  i never break out and this was pretty instantaneous.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I had been using Cetaphyl for a long time, and while it moisturized my skin well, it never got any of my makeup off. I also wanted a product that looked and smelled a little prettier to make me more excited about washing my face in the morning. Ladies, you know what I&#x27;m talking about. Packaging &amp; fragrance count with beauty products! I didn&#x27;t really want to spend money at Sephora or Nordstrom to find an alternative, and I am so pleased with the quality, experience, and price of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lathers up more than Cetaphyl (or any of those non-soap cleansers), but just a touch. It is literally just a hint of lather. If I could design my own soap and figure out how much lather to put into it, this would be the sweet spot! It takes my makeup off (fuller coverage Clinique, or very cling-heavy mineral powder) but doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. And I have very dry combination skin, and live in Colorado where the sun is harsh, the wind whips, and the air is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that could make this product better for me is the smell-- if they somehow made it smell floral, or minty, or cucumber-y, or something. As is, the fragrance isn&#x27;t bad at all, just a bit neutral. But I will take neutral fragrance over lots of chemicals and additives any day. Thank you Burt&#x27;s Bees!</li>
            <li> Impressed with the gentle cleansing power of this product. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I used to use the boscia face wash, but at almost three times the price for less product, I eventually switched entirely to the Burt&#x27;s Bees. The smell isn&#x27;t bothersome (I&#x27;ve used it for so long that it&#x27;s unnoticeable to me now). I don&#x27;t have oily or bad skin prone to breakouts, so I don&#x27;t need a strong, harsh facial cleanser. Overall, this keeps my face feeling clean and removes my makeup easily, so I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> My skin is very oily, and I have been lookng for some time now a facial cleanser that not just make my skin feel fresh when I use it, but a long time after that. This one do that! I use it twice a day and in just  one week I have start seeing the results. Some  people complain about the smell, well it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> My skin type: Combination, Sensitive&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for: Combination, Oily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, I wanted to buy this cleanser because of its packaging. The vintagey colors, with the pretty borders surrounding the logo. When I received it, I was a little surprised and disappointed to see how small and slim the bottle was. But fortunately for me, it turned out to be the best cleanser I have ever owned! This cleanser got rid of all my spots (you know those painful little bumps we sometimes get) in one wash. As I worked it into my face, I LITERALLY FELT the bump go down beneath my fingers. The only problem I have with this cleanser is that I feel it doesn&#x27;t lather enough. Also, because I have sensitive skin, I sort of get this slight burning sensation (like when you put toner on). But I think this is what helps dry out the pimples and I don&#x27;t find it an issue as once I wash it off, the burning sensation goes away. As for the scent of this, let me just set the record straight and say that once you start applying it on your face, it does smell kinda weird but its not an overwhelming sort of smell. And once you rinse it off, it DOES NOT stay. So for all those bad comments about the smell.. maybe they&#x27;ve just got really sensitive noses. Do be warned tho, it really does hurt when this product goes anywhere near your eyes.. EVEN IF THEY ARE CLOSED.</li>
            <li> For so long Ive wanted this cleanser, and i finally got it. Not from Amazon though. Before purchasing, i looked at countless of reviews to see how it rating, and to see if this product was right for me. After my first wash i was very happy. I just had to make sure it was completely washed off my face. So make sure you really wash it off, and finish by splashing somewhat cold water on your face. Many comments Ive seen about this product are about the fragrance. In my opinion it smells great! I have sensitive skin, so this was a worry for me. But the cleanser is great for my skin (so far) ill see in about a week. Many have said that an all natural cleanser shouldn&#x27;t have fragrance added. But guess what, about 99% of cleansers on the store shelf have fragrance added its just not as obvious. For example Neutrogena oil-free acne wash. Last thing listed in the ingredients is fragrance. If your a person that has sensitive skin, that almost reddens from anything. This is for you. but everyone&#x27;s skin is different.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling fresh and moisturized every time. I use it 3 times a day and I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Mike but effective and pleasant.</li>
            <li> This product is being discontinued along with the other Radiance too. Very drying on your face.  And sometimes will leave a burning sensation.  Don&#x27;t use it anymore.  Maybe Amazon will get the newer line.  Using it now and loving it:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for about 2 weeks now only at night and my face is starting to feel so smooth. (I have a rough uneven skin texture) 6/8/15</li>
            <li> Keep my skin fresh and clean.  I may not shower everyday but I sure as hell was my face with this stuff everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised that in all these glowing reviews, no one has mentioned how STRONG the smell of this facial wash is- and not necessarily a pleasant one. I thought Burt&#x27;s Bees was supposed to be natural, but now I wonder.  Given all the great reviews, I really wanted to like this product, but I don&#x27;t know if I will be able to stand the aroma long enough to see if it works!</li>
            <li> Used it twice already already see the difference the next day.  My skin looks dewier and rejuvenated in the morning.  And no flakiness that happens from the dehydrating air-conditioning effect.  So I&#x27;m a total believer!  Can&#x27;t wait for my other Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance products to come!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice cleanser that removes all your makeup (except waterproof mascara) it smells nice and wont dry out your skin. I love this product and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Good quality face wash - like the convenient pump; does not dry skin out - gentle yet very efficient with getting skin clean.</li>
            <li> Takes mascara and eyeliner off with one wash!</li>
            <li> My HG face wash. Excellent at balancing my combination skin. It&#x27;s never damaging or drying to my dry patches yet effectively cleans my oily areas. This sloughs off dead dry skin but not in an abrasive or chemical burn way - more like enzymes that eat away skin (not really sure how to explain this but it&#x27;s very gentle and effective). I usually don&#x27;t like drug store skin care but this is exceptional - truly feels high end. It doesn&#x27;t lather up like other soaps but my derm told me that&#x27;s actually a good thing because the sulfates that create lather are damaging to the skin and I even prefer this texture anyway, it feels slippery and expensive.   I recommend for all skin types - it&#x27;s a must for combination skins though.</li>
            <li> Like all Bee products.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT! CLEAN AND LEAVE MY SKIN FEELING HYDRATED.</li>
            <li> Best cleanser I have ever used. Smells amazing and does the job without drying out my skin. Will be my go to face wash from now on... Thank you Burts Bees!!!</li>
            <li> I believe my title is review enough.. but, this really is the BEST FACE WASH EVER! It&#x27;s soooooo soft feeling, leaves your face super soft and smells really nice. Plus, the best benefit of all is your school is sooo beautiful after every use!</li>
            <li> nice scent, cleans well</li>
            <li> I always wanted to try this product.  Just as I expected. It is a great cleanser for winter time. It leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser.  Non drying.  Takes off make up easy.  Will buy again</li>
            <li> This is my carefully chosen, although I haven&#x27;t started to use, but I like it very much, hope it won&#x27;t let me down.</li>
