            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Using them both makes my hair look and feel amazing.</li>
            <li>It just happens to have lavender oil and tea tree oil - this combination of oils has been proven to be effective as lice treatment.</li>
            <li>The smell is very mild and pleasant.    </li>
            <li>This conditioner is better at moisturizing my scalp than head &amp; shoulders conditioner.</li>

            <li>I love the smell of this conditioner and if you&#x27;re going to buy the shampoo you should also buy the conditioner.</li>

            <li>and I love that it&#x27;s eco-friendly.  </li>
            <li>I like this product but don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li>Love the EWG rating of 1.</li>
            <li>Smells lovely.</li>
            <li>The tea tree oil scent is extremely overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the lavender too.</li>
            <li>so it may not be an issue for you), but my 14 yr old niece LOVED IT!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always very clean feeling.     </li>
            <li>the shampoo is awesome, sometimes the conditioners are a bit greasy, esp on my daughters long hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments and feel good that I&#x27;m using a safe and natural product.</li>
            <li>Nice conditioner, works well, and not much fragrance, but that&#x27;s a good thing since I was looking for a healthy product.</li>
            <li>It works fine.</li>
            <li>You know, something that will make your hair feel silky smooth and make it easy to detangle...    </li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel silky in the shower after applying and rinsing, and super easy to comb and detangle out of the shower.</li>
            <li>At home, I just get clean hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural, soothes my scalp, is very reasonably price and has a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>Works very well as top conditioners.</li>
            <li>A quick brush after the shower</li>
            <li>Luckily there&#x27;s nothing on the legs</li>
            <li>It can make your hair look a bit oily if you use too much, so make sure you experiment and get the right balance for you.</li>
            <li>I bought a different variety of this brand for my kids and they&#x27;re loving it as well.</li>
            <li>I feel like I need to rinse it out again, even right after I get out of the shower</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft, occasionally I supplement it with a leave-in conditioner, but for daily washing, this is great!</li>
            <li>Overall this product is great - it has a very low toxicity rating and works well with my hair type.</li>
            <li>I have fine, natural oily hair by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I really really like this conditioner!</li>
            <li>This product is not only wonderful for the natural aspect, it also leaves my hair looking so much better and feeling softer; I have unbelievably thick hair - it never feels this angel soft.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair that needs a lot of moisture to keep it from looking dry, and while this product is great if I am JUST conditioning my hair, if I am applying after shampooing it, I don&#x27;t get enough moisture.  </li>
            <li>You have to use a bit more than some other conditioners, but if you leave it in for a minute or two it seems like a lot of it gets absorbed by your hair.</li>
            <li>Tea tree smell is too strong and it has left my hair feeling very oily.</li>
            <li>I really like this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I really like this conditioner.</li>
            <li>Works very well for me,</li>
            <li>This product really relaxes and moisturizes my hair.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo has decreased the oily issue with the roots and the conditioner works great with my ends.</li>
            <li>It really worked - the ARNICA MONTANA (ARNICA) FLOWER EXTRACT as an allergen from the EWG site.</li>
            <li>It conditions my hair and doesn&#x27;t irritate or cause my scalp to itch as many other conditioners do.</li>
            <li>This conditioner works better than the other natural conditioners I&#x27;ve tried and doesnt leave my hair dry and prone to static electricty.</li>
            <li>Works well and scent is nice, not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I can live with that!</li>
            <li>Considering I had to buy commercial conditioner every 1.5 months, I&#x27;m really satisfied with this product overall.</li>
            <li>I love the natural ingredients list, and this bottle will last me a surprisingly long time.  </li>
            <li>this leaves your hair feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>My first wash I used shampoo all over hair and then same with the conditioner.</li>
            <li>and I noticed several others said the same thing (on the Sweet Orange Conditioner reviews).  </li>
            <li>not the softest but soft</li>
            <li>all natural..</li>
            <li>i never find all natural conditioner beyond this product..</li>
            <li>but thats the price to pay when going natural</li>
            <li>Worked well on my curly, knotty hair but my daughter, with straight hair, said it left her hair greasy.</li>
            <li>(we have soft water-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to all synthetic chemicals in shampoos and conditioners and can&#x27;t deal with the perfumes.</li>
            <li>But still the conditioner manages to make it mostly soft, and always leaves it manageable.    </li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t get it 5 stars is the lavender scent is a bit strong, but it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>But usually I&#x27;ll wash my hair with baby shampoo or cleansing cream after, then it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for all hair types actually.</li>
            <li>It does make my hair softer initially, it&#x27;s not like normal conditioners though</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had problems with other natural conditioners leaving my hair coarse and thin, but this one leaves it feeling very full and smooth.</li>
            <li>The only flaw about this product is that it has a strange smell of a fish store when first applied.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the shipping was timely.</li>
            <li>I find that I can use even less of it than any other conditioner out there and my hair stays soft, light, and</li>
            <li>What I love is that this conditioner never makes my hair feel heavy, weighed down, or waxy/coated with product build up.</li>
            <li>Other than that I really like it myself.</li>
            <li>When dry, depending on which shampoo I used (I am still experimenting with those as well), my hair has reached that really soft and silky feeling, like out of the salon!</li>
            <li>I can easily see this bottle lasting me 4 months at least!</li>

            <li> The smell is decent too even though I&#x27;m not a huge lavender fan.</li>
            <li> It really gives a similar feeling to traditional chemical products, which is very satisfying, especially in addition to the fact that this product does NOT contain nasty and harmful chemicals!    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s in it, but my ears are red and itchy and swollen to twice their normal size and the back of my neck is covered with itchy bumps.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same thing when I looked up the reviews carefully again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a very difficult time finding a detangling conditioner that is actually healthy for my hair.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t moisturize my hair enough.  </li>
            <li> and my hair is still wet.</li>
            <li> It really took a week for the terrible reaction to appear, and I thought it was safe after the 1st day or two of use.</li>
            <li> It works just as well as the other shampoo I used to use</li>
            <li> I brought this one because allergy was reported on the other Hugo conditioner due to another ingredient.</li>
            <li> On the upside, no animals were ever suffered due to testing.</li>
            <li> But, as the other reviewer said, it does leave an oily residue and make my hair look slightly greasy.</li>
            <li> Switching to natural hair products, it has been very difficult to find a conditioner that performs well enough to satisfy, after being used to the chemical ones I had been using for so long, before I went \\&quot;green\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, this happened to me after a few weeks of using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black</li>
            <li> Detangles, but less slick feeling than other conditioners.</li>
            <li> (Though I find if I use the wrong shampoo or over-wash my hair, I get less soft results).</li>
            <li> even though its amount is small and texture is watery..</li>
            <li> We battled it with the usual&#x27;s, cortisone cream followed by OTC allergy tablets.</li>
            <li> The smell is dull and the the product drys hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what ingredient in this shampoo is the problem, but it seems to be fairly common with this brand.  </li>
            <li> It got worse from head to thighs, and noticeable swelling on the face.</li>
            <li> Can use a dime size amount for a head of thin, shoulder length hair about every 2 - 3 days.</li>
            <li> nonetheless.doesnt smell like coconut though and is quite expensive 12$ at sprouts.</li>
            <li> I have had a horrible allergic reaction to this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This conditioner is better at moisturizing my scalp than head &amp; shoulders conditioner. But, as the other reviewer said, it does leave an oily residue and make my hair look slightly greasy. But usually I&#x27;ll wash my hair with baby shampoo or cleansing cream after, then it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> this leaves your hair feeling very soft. not the softest but soft nonetheless.doesnt smell like coconut though and is quite expensive 12$ at sprouts.</li>
            <li> love this conditioner</li>
            <li> very good stuff.. very good ingredient.. all natural.. even though its amount is small and texture is watery.. i never find all natural conditioner beyond this product.. i found one.. the name is eco store.. it is cheaper.. but i just using amazone..</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner.  It conditions my hair and doesn&#x27;t irritate or cause my scalp to itch as many other conditioners do.</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner. I&#x27;ve had problems with other natural conditioners leaving my hair coarse and thin, but this one leaves it feeling very full and smooth. You have to use a bit more than some other conditioners, but if you leave it in for a minute or two it seems like a lot of it gets absorbed by your hair. The only reason I didn&#x27;t get it 5 stars is the lavender scent is a bit strong, but it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Works very well as top conditioners. The only flaw about this product is that it has a strange smell of a fish store when first applied.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the shipping was timely.</li>
            <li> Works very well for me, I&#x27;m black so my hair is...  This product really relaxes and moisturizes my hair.  A quick brush after the shower and i have perfect waves and texture.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this conditioner and if you&#x27;re going to buy the shampoo you should also buy the conditioner. I went a couple days with just the shampoo because I have oily hair but it was too drying. Using them both makes my hair look and feel amazing. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments and feel good that I&#x27;m using a safe and natural product.</li>
            <li> I love the smell. It does make my hair softer initially, it&#x27;s not like normal conditioners though but thats the price to pay when going natural I guess. I can live with that!</li>
            <li> Need I say more?  It works just as well as the other shampoo I used to use and I love that it&#x27;s eco-friendly.  I bought a different variety of this brand for my kids and they&#x27;re loving it as well.</li>
            <li> Tea tree smell is too strong and it has left my hair feeling very oily. I feel like I need to rinse it out again, even right after I get out of the shower and my hair is still wet. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I like this product but don&#x27;t love it.  It&#x27;s all natural, soothes my scalp, is very reasonably price and has a pleasant smell.  My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t moisturize my hair enough.  I have very curly hair that needs a lot of moisture to keep it from looking dry, and while this product is great if I am JUST conditioning my hair, if I am applying after shampooing it, I don&#x27;t get enough moisture.  So I&#x27;m now using it on days when I only condition my hair and am using another product by Theraneem on days when I shampoo.  The combo works great.</li>
            <li> This product is not only wonderful for the natural aspect, it also leaves my hair looking so much better and feeling softer; I have unbelievably thick hair - it never feels this angel soft. The smell is pleasant too.</li>
            <li> the shampoo is awesome, sometimes the conditioners are a bit greasy, esp on my daughters long hair. her mom says it leaves her hair greasy. i say her mom, but i could also say my wife. it&#x27;s not like we are divorced or separated or anything, Heaven forbid.</li>
            <li> Love the EWG rating of 1. It works fine. Smells lovely. Detangles, but less slick feeling than other conditioners. Happy it&#x27;s not an added fragrance. It&#x27;s a temporary fragrance from the essential oils. Had my hair dresser use this following a color treatment. Hair came out awesome! Salon results from my hair dresser. No complaints from her either! At home, I just get clean hair.</li>
            <li> Worked well on my curly, knotty hair but my daughter, with straight hair, said it left her hair greasy.</li>
            <li> Overall this product is great - it has a very low toxicity rating and works well with my hair type. I have fine, natural oily hair by the end of the day. I bought the shampoo and conditioner together. My first wash I used shampoo all over hair and then same with the conditioner. I ended up with greasy roots all day.  Day 2 through now, I wash all over with the shampoo and then condition only my ends. The shampoo has decreased the oily issue with the roots and the conditioner works great with my ends. I recommend buying the shampoo and conditioner together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue with this product is that it is supposed to be lavender and tea tree oil scented and I can&#x27;t detect even the smallest hint of lavender. The tea tree oil scent is extremely overwhelming. I will be trying the Hugo coconut scented shampoo/conditioner next.</li>
            <li> This conditioner should be marketed as a preventative for lice for school age children. It just happens to have lavender oil and tea tree oil - this combination of oils has been proven to be effective as lice treatment.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the smell or the amount of time it took to rinse out of my hair (we have soft water- so it may not be an issue for you), but my 14 yr old niece LOVED IT!  So, I split the difference and gave it 3 stars instead of 1.</li>
            <li> The smell is dull and the the product drys hair.</li>
            <li> I have had a horrible allergic reaction to this product and I noticed several others said the same thing (on the Sweet Orange Conditioner reviews).  I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s in it, but my ears are red and itchy and swollen to twice their normal size and the back of my neck is covered with itchy bumps.  It&#x27;s awful.  I don&#x27;t know what ingredient in this shampoo is the problem, but it seems to be fairly common with this brand.  Like other reviewers, this happened to me after a few weeks of using it.</li>
            <li> I love it! Great seller!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to all synthetic chemicals in shampoos and conditioners and can&#x27;t deal with the perfumes. Hugo Naturals are wonderful.</li>
            <li> I really really like this conditioner! I&#x27;ve had a very difficult time finding a detangling conditioner that is actually healthy for my hair. I love the smell of the lavender too. I highly recommend this for all hair types actually.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, and it is a great price! It leaves my hair soft, occasionally I supplement it with a leave-in conditioner, but for daily washing, this is great!</li>
            <li> This conditioner works better than the other natural conditioners I&#x27;ve tried and doesnt leave my hair dry and prone to static electricty. The smell is decent too even though I&#x27;m not a huge lavender fan.</li>
            <li> Works well and scent is nice, not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Nice conditioner, works well, and not much fragrance, but that&#x27;s a good thing since I was looking for a healthy product.</li>
            <li> It really worked - the ARNICA MONTANA (ARNICA) FLOWER EXTRACT as an allergen from the EWG site. Only one kid in our family have allergy reaction. I brought this one because allergy was reported on the other Hugo conditioner due to another ingredient. It&#x27;s the same thing when I looked up the reviews carefully again. It really took a week for the terrible reaction to appear, and I thought it was safe after the 1st day or two of use. We battled it with the usual&#x27;s, cortisone cream followed by OTC allergy tablets. It got worse from head to thighs, and noticeable swelling on the face. And it coincided with the measles outbreak! Luckily there&#x27;s nothing on the legs so we never thought it was measles. Finally we have to take the kid to see the doctor to have some oral medicine, which should be stronger steroid than cortisone.  On the upside, no animals were ever suffered due to testing. Other than that I really like it myself.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is a wonderful compliment to the shampoo. I find that I can use even less of it than any other conditioner out there and my hair stays soft, light, and I never feel any product residue. I love the natural ingredients list, and this bottle will last me a surprisingly long time.  Can use a dime size amount for a head of thin, shoulder length hair about every 2 - 3 days. I can easily see this bottle lasting me 4 months at least! Considering I had to buy commercial conditioner every 1.5 months, I&#x27;m really satisfied with this product overall.</li>
            <li> Switching to natural hair products, it has been very difficult to find a conditioner that performs well enough to satisfy, after being used to the chemical ones I had been using for so long, before I went \\&quot;green\\&quot;. You know, something that will make your hair feel silky smooth and make it easy to detangle...    It has been 4+ years that I have been trying different products and remedies out; I&#x27;ve tried a lot. Finally I found this.    It makes my hair feel silky in the shower after applying and rinsing, and super easy to comb and detangle out of the shower. When dry, depending on which shampoo I used (I am still experimenting with those as well), my hair has reached that really soft and silky feeling, like out of the salon! (Though I find if I use the wrong shampoo or over-wash my hair, I get less soft results). But still the conditioner manages to make it mostly soft, and always leaves it manageable.    It can make your hair look a bit oily if you use too much, so make sure you experiment and get the right balance for you. What I love is that this conditioner never makes my hair feel heavy, weighed down, or waxy/coated with product build up. It&#x27;s always very clean feeling.     It really gives a similar feeling to traditional chemical products, which is very satisfying, especially in addition to the fact that this product does NOT contain nasty and harmful chemicals!    The smell is very mild and pleasant.    I am very happy to have found this conditioner.</li>
