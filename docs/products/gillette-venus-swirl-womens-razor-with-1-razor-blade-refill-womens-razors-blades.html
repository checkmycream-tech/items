            <li>I was very excited to try this product !</li>
            <li>4 stars because it works amazingly as any Venus razor I have tried.</li>
            <li>This razor is amazing and does not nick or cut.</li>
            <li>The razor itself is amazing.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing razor.</li>
            <li>So that was amazing and</li>
            <li>This razor is amazing</li>
            <li>And likewise it shaves smoothly across my scalp without the scrapes I was getting from otherwise great blades designed for shaving a face.</li>
            <li>Mach-3 Turbo&amp;#34;, which she liked,</li>
            <li>and I honestly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>and it was really nice.</li>

            <li>This razor gave me a nice shave.</li>
            <li>The feel of the handle makes it nice to shave with.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that I will find another razor that is this nice.</li>
            <li>It is kind of on the pricey side at $11.47</li>
            <li>and this came in handy for me when I ran out of shave gel and didn&#x27;t want to hop out of the shower to get another can.</li>
            <li>it will probably make it the ABSOLUTE perfect shave.</li>
            <li>All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>I honestly wouldn&#x27;t have purchased yet another razor I knew wouldn&#x27;t do the job.  </li>
            <li>I liked this razor,</li>
            <li>and I really liked how it worked on my underarms.  </li>
            <li>I also liked the way the moisturizing strips make my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>Glides so nicely over legs.</li>
            <li>I did not receive any kind of cover for my razor which would be nice so that it doesn&#x27;t rust.</li>
            <li>, this is my own review and experience with the Gillette Venus swirl razor.    </li>
            <li>And no I wasn&#x27;t paid to give this review, if I didn&#x27;t like the razor I would be honest and say I didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>No cutting yourself, just beautiful smoothness.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone looking for a new 5 blade razor that is flexiable and will provide an excellent close shave.</li>
            <li>I was able to try the great product free from BzzAgent</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and the handle has a good grip.</li>
            <li>I received it from Venus to try and I am so glad they did because I am in love with Venus again!  </li>
            <li>It smells good and helps deliver a smooth shave.)</li>
            <li>by far one of the best razors I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The Venus Swirl razor is by far the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used!  </li>
            <li>So glad I did as this razor is amazing.</li>
            <li>It was the most amazing razor handle I have used.</li>
            <li>Being a women, it sure is nice that there is a product out there can help.</li>
            <li>I do still use shaving gel with it, but the moisture bar on the razor is also nice in terms of the razor gliding with more ease.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely convinced this is the best razor for women out there.</li>
            <li>Wow, this was probably the best razor that I have ever used!  </li>
            <li>All in all, I still love my Schick Hydro Silk, but the Gillette Venus Swirl is an amazing addition.</li>
            <li>I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting this razor to deliver everything that it claimed, because most cartridge razors don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I tend to nick and cut myself with shaving and between the good grip and smooth feet, I don&#x27;t need to worry about that anymore.</li>
            <li>This razor is perfect for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was able to try this amazing product for free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I just would have liked to see the ball move around a bit more than it did.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>:) also the shaving cream smells amazing too</li>
            <li>It feels good in her hand, and the razor is also very pretty, with the nice purplish color and all the swirls.</li>
            <li>Love how cute the razor is and it works even better than it looks!</li>
            <li>I used it right after I received it from Bzzagent and was super impressed.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good razor for a while and was excited to try this.</li>
            <li>The contour blades do a good job at getting stubble, and getting a close clean shave.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy to have the chance to try the Venus Swirl for free, thanks to Buzz Agent and Venus and Gillette.</li>
            <li>I could get a smooth, burn free shave without shaving cream from this razor and that is super impressive to me!</li>
            <li>I was able to use this awesome razor FREE thanks to Gillette and BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>Usually I&#x27;m pretty happy with Venus</li>
            <li>This razor is awesome, definitely the best ive tried thus far.</li>
            <li>It also glides across my knees and ankles very smoothly.</li>

            <li>Very smooth shave</li>
            <li>I know that the cartridges may seem like a steep price when looking at the quantity, but the quality is worth it (and the color is pretty great too)!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful it is easy to use and gives you a close soft shave.  </li>
            <li>Also, I am not scared with the razor to shave my armpits, knees, ankles and bikini area, and it does not get irritated, which is a huge relief for me!  </li>
            <li>Love the 5 blades instead of the 4 I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li>but she thinks the &amp;#34;Venus Swirl&amp;#34; is better.</li>

            <li>My legs were so smooth after using this razor!</li>
            <li>Its ok I cant see a difference.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing razor, I couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth my skin was.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great razor for an affordable price!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for the perfect razor!</li>
            <li>but I love the Venus brand</li>
            <li>This thing goes over my knee caps like a champ giving me a nice smooth finish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with it</li>
            <li>i love the flexi ball, the design of the razor, and the gel.</li>

            <li>I love that this has 5 blades</li>

            <li>I love this razor.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>though I don&#x27;t feel like the shiny ball makes my shave any better.</li>
            <li>I normally love Venus razors its all I use.</li>
            <li>then ever use this even if I got it for free!</li>
            <li>Okay, I guess, if you like living on the edge.</li>
            <li>I received my Gillette Venus Swirl and love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE MY GILLETTE VENUS SWIRL RAZOR😍</li>
            <li>I genuinely LOVE this razor.</li>
            <li>Having used multiple razors I have always been most impressed with Gillette Venus Products.</li>
            <li>but I probably wouldn&#x27;t spend the money on it unless I was able to combine a sale with a coupon.</li>
            <li>I love how the head swivels also..</li>
            <li>I love that the ball helps contour the razor to my body.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m still in love with the Venus Swirl</li>
            <li>Love this razor.</li>
            <li>The second time on my armpits and it worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li>and I love the soap around the edge.</li>
            <li>I could never figure out why men have better razors than women do,</li>
            <li>My favorite part of this razor is the cartridge.</li>
            <li>Love this razor.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>This Razor is awesome because it leaves no hair and keeps your legs soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It has 5 blades and the more blades the better.</li>
            <li>these razors glide with my curves and give me a nice smooth shave.</li>
            <li>on top of it there is a swril ball</li>
            <li>I was able to try this razor.</li>
            <li>I was still able to finish shaving my legs with a smooth shave!</li>
            <li>I love the ball and that it lets the razor glide over every part of my legs to ensure an even shave.</li>
            <li>It hugged the curves of my body better, giving me a better shave and experience.</li>
            <li>This product has taken the &amp;#34;chore&amp;#34; of shaving and turned it into an enjoyable pampering experience.</li>
            <li>For more of my product reviews and buying guides, visit: http://melindalongoria.hubpages.com/</li>
            <li>received this sample for free and agreed to give an honest opinion</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know how many times I knicked one of them, and it started to bleed.</li>
            <li>I love the lubrastrip.</li>
            <li>My legs feel smooth and amazing.</li>
            <li>I love the flexball design of this razor blade.</li>
            <li>I love that this has 5 blades</li>
            <li>In fact it glides so smoothly that it doesn&#x27;t even feel like you are shaving, but you are!</li>
            <li>I have to make sure</li>
            <li>I can just buy a variety more to my liking and still use this lovely handle.  </li>
            <li>and I love it and will buy the refills for it.</li>
            <li>never thought a razor would be able to do that</li>
            <li>Very impressed with the comfort of the handle, the closeness of the shave, and the overall appearance of my skin post-shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My favorite part about this razor is the MoistureGlide serum.  </li>
            <li>and I love the swivel head.</li>
            <li>I was highly pleased with how moisturizing the moisture strip was.</li>
            <li>Purple happens to be my favorite color.</li>
            <li>am in love with this one.</li>
            <li>But then BzzAgent came along and asked me if I wanted to be part of the campaign where Gillette would so kindly give one of these away for free for us to try.</li>
            <li>but I was expecting the silver pivoting head to move a lot more than it did.  </li>
            <li>I tried 2 more days in a row, with soap and without</li>
            <li>The aspect I like the most and was not expecting, was the purple part that sits around the blades.</li>
            <li>Love the color.</li>
            <li>I bought this on impulse thinking it would be just ok.</li>
            <li>the swirl ball makes -- this was actually the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I could do this!&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite razor in ages.</li>
            <li>To top it off it&#x27;s my favorite color purple</li>
            <li>Love this razor it has given me the closest shave yet and the smoothest LOVE VENUS</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the close shave that I got and</li>
            <li>Glides ever so smooth and no Knicks!</li>
            <li>I never thought my legs could be so smooth!</li>
            <li>This is definitely one of the best razors I have used before!  </li>
            <li>you are able to use any variety of the Venus razor replacement blades.</li>
            <li>After trying many razors i would recommend this for sure.</li>
            <li>I actually enjoy shaving my legs!</li>
            <li>It is advertised to pivot in ways that make shaving easier and more efficient.</li>
            <li>I will definitely get more cartridges for this great Venus handle!</li>
            <li>but I do appreciate Venus trying to create a better razor.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Overall, I really love this razor!!!</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try it</li>
            <li>I was hoping to love the new one because i thought, I love Venus and one that swivels would be an even better version great.</li>
            <li>Great new razor!  </li>
            <li>What makes this razor stand apart is the flexibility of the blades to more easily shape my leg and pull more hair while shaving.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Venus for letting me try this amazing razor!</li>
            <li>First off, my armpits have never looked so good.</li>
            <li>This is the best shave I&#x27;ve gotten in a long time.</li>
            <li>Over all this razor was pretty good.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to see the five blade for girls!</li>

            <li>I have fallen in love with this razor, I did not buy it off Amazon because I got it free to review</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great as far as razors go.</li>
            <li>I was able to test out this razor, plus the shaving cream for free</li>
            <li>I literally had to check to see if it was actually touching my skin and shaving my hair, that&#x27;s how smooth it was.</li>
            <li>all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this razor to glide a lot more smoothly than anticipated.</li>
            <li>, I think you should use shaving cream, but it still went smoothly and I was able to shave my legs without any dryness or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>and I am still smooth and stubble free!</li>
            <li>I was recently able to try this razor free from Gillette and let me tell you,</li>
            <li>I love that it moves to fit the contours of my legs.</li>
            <li>I got to try these free from the company which makes this even better.</li>
            <li>I love it so much !!!</li>
            <li>I am super impressed with this and definitely will continue using it.</li>
            <li>and I can confidently say it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li>but it is super easy to use!</li>
            <li>I got it for free thanks to Venus, and it is the best new razor out there.</li>
            <li>and it cut through my neglected leg hair easily.</li>
            <li>so easy to shave and</li>
            <li>but it glides over your body so easily.</li>
            <li>The Flexiball technology makes shaving my knees so easy and painless.  </li>
            <li>but this was so easy because of the movement of the head</li>
            <li>One of my favorite features is the MoistureGlide serum which makes the blade effortlessly glide over your skin for a smooth moisturized silky smooth shave.</li>
            <li>The flex ball technology makes it so easy to shave the contours of your legs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy and comfortable to use and gets the job quickly.</li>
            <li>I was super excited to get the Venus swirl razor from BZZAGENT for free to provide my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>I did not feel as though my shave was quite as nice and quite as close as it was the first two times</li>
            <li>The flexi-ball technology allows the razor blade to pivot both up and down and side to side, allowing for excellent skin coverage.  </li>
            <li>I loved this new razor .  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more cartridges and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use my own throat sore again!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice any kind of closer or better shave than I normally get with another Venus.</li>
            <li>The design was light and slim and It was easy to hold and handle.  </li>
            <li>I got cut and the lotion line on top is already all most gone after first use.</li>
            <li>Typically I do not shave as often during the winter, like most women I know, and this razor, with one swip, was able to remove the hair and leave a nice smooth feeling on my legs.</li>
            <li>easy shave with smooth results.</li>
            <li>I was quickly drawn to the textured, purple handle and its artsy pattern that is pleasing to look at and efficient for gripping.</li>
            <li>And the Venus Swirl&#x27;s five contour blades give a super close shave and leave my legs feeling so smooth!  </li>
            <li>I was able to shave quickly and so close</li>
            <li>When trying out this razor it occurred to me quickly that it wasn&#x27;t quite as flexible as advertised, it seemed to do the job very well and with accuracy, but I still would of liked more flexibility.</li>
            <li>I was a fan of the awesome little comb-nubs before the blades making even the shortest of  hair stand up.</li>
            <li>Gillette was kind enough to give me a free sample of Venus Swirl and I am so glad they did!  </li>

            <li>My wife received this fancy razor from Venus to try for free.</li>
            <li>It really made the process quicker and more enjoyable.</li>
            <li>I love the flex ball because it really does allow the razor head to move better around my knee area which I often cut.</li>
            <li>After using only two blade disposable razors this is absolutely the best my legs have ever felt!</li>
            <li>It really made the process quicker and more enjoyable.</li>
            <li>I also loved how cute the actual razor was.</li>
            <li>The only reason i put 4 stars is because the head didnt move as much as i had anticipated but it is a wonderful razor</li>
            <li>The design on the handle is even cute, my husband loved the way my legs felt and the shave and smoothness lasted longer than with most other razors I have tried.</li>
            <li>I am able to go right over the skin tags on my underarms without knicking them.</li>

            <li>but lets just say that I found my new favorite razor!</li>
            <li>I found the head super easy to clean as I was using it as well.</li>
            <li>FUN!</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this razor that I got to try courtesy of Gillette and Bzzagent.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited about receiving the Gillette Venus Swirl from Bzzagent as a way to review the product.</li>
            <li>and I love this razor SO much!</li>
            <li>first, when I saw ads for the Venus Rollerball, I thought it was just going to be a gimmick, but I bought it on impulse at Target, and I&#x27;m really glad I did.</li>
            <li>And I have to say, I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try it because I&#x27;m always looking for a closer shave.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to give the Venus Swirl a try.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited to have the option of a swirl razor handle, that would make it easier to get into those hard-to-reach areas.</li>
            <li>so I used the razor again, made sure I was nice and smooth and didn&#x27;t miss any spots but again, by the next day I was prickly.</li>
            <li>No more razor knicks on my knees or ankles, which is awesome.</li>
            <li>Thanks to BzzAgent and Gillette, I got this sweet puppy in the mail!!</li>
            <li>the flexiball really made it easy to shave around my ankle and knee cap without any nicks!</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to get to try The Venus Swirl for free and it&#x27;s absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get them clean.</li>
            <li>I received my product free from bzz agent but free or not it&#x27;s definitely worth what you would pay for it</li>
            <li>My legs are super smooth &amp; I don&#x27;t feel like I missed a spot since the razor moved with my body.</li>
            <li>I was able to try this razor out for free through a promotion (BzzAgent) thanks to Gillette</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I had the opportunity to try it, though, because it really did make a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Before I got this product I wanted to know how well it removes hair and gives you a clean shave.</li>
            <li>She already uses a Venus brand (disposable) razor and wasn&#x27;t sure the experience would get much better, but she was pleasantly surprised by the movement and close shave of this razor.</li>
            <li>It was even easy to shave my knees :) I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I liked that the cartridge comes with its own little container and easily attaches and removes itself from the razor.</li>
            <li>It was very comfortable to hold and the shave I got was very close considering.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>The handle, however, is nothing special.</li>
            <li>I would probably purchase the replacement blades for the product again to use during special occasions- since refills are costly for my budget-21.00 for a package of 4.</li>
            <li>That being said, this one was nothing special.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s job, just don&#x27;t expect anything special because of the pivoting</li>
            <li>like I said, it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li>Incredibly better than my older version of Venus!  </li>
            <li>So I was super excited when I saw an ad on tv that Gillette was coming out with a flexball version for women.</li>
            <li>and Would totally recommend this to ANYONE who would like a nice, close and clean shave!</li>
            <li>That being said, it functions great as a regular razor, so that&#x27;s exactly what you&#x27;ll get.</li>
            <li>However, not so sure the ball really adds anything to this.</li>
            <li>It does have 5 blades compared to 3 in my old one and it glides/handles nicely.</li>
            <li>I was able to try this thanks to bzzagent.com.  </li>
            <li>I was not so sure about spending  so much on a razor.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that they really provide any better results than a disposable.</li>
            <li>I bought it on Amazon because the prime price was $4 cheaper than my drugstore, so overall it was a good deal, even if it does not work as &amp;#34;swirly&amp;#34; as it is advertised.</li>
            <li>I was able to use this razor thanks to Gillette.</li>
            <li>I was able to try the Venus swirl thanks to a sample from Venus.</li>
            <li>I was able to test this razor out thanks to Gillett and bzzagent.</li>
            <li>This looked cool, so</li>
            <li>but it does last a good bit of time.</li>
            <li>I was able to use this razor thanks to Gillette and BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>Smoothest my legs ever been next to a good wax job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good razor and I will be using it regularly from now on, but</li>
            <li>I was able to use this razor thanks to Gillette and BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li>I was able to get this razor thanks to BzzAgent.com.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thanks to Gillete and Bzzagent, I was able to receive this product as part of a promotion.</li>
            <li>I  Think it&#x27;s such a good looking razor that it makes me want to shave my legs instead of</li>
            <li>First and foremost, I love the packaging that it came in, which right away tells you what the product is about.</li>
            <li>Best of all, no more knicks!</li>
            <li>So easy to use, and just as it&#x27;s advertised it makes shaving the curves and contours of your body much easier!</li>
            <li>The blades themselves are as sharp as mens which is great for getting a close shave.</li>
            <li>Glad to say I&#x27;ve found one :) the only mishap I don&#x27;t like about the razor is I don&#x27;t like the handle.</li>
            <li>It gives a super close shave and no razor burn.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really feel like I was shaving, but when I was done a had a smooth, close, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t think the razor is anything more special than any other razor on the market.</li>
            <li>again, I am in love with this razor and would highly recommend giving it a try.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited when I got to try the Venus Swirl for free thanks to Gillette.</li>
            <li>, it is a very pretty, sleek design.</li>
            <li>It is very pretty, and caught my eye.</li>
            <li>I tried this product free thanks to Gillette!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying this product for free thanks to Venus!</li>
            <li>It also has a long handle with a good grip so no slip.</li>
            <li>Gillette is always on edge when it comes to new and innovative technology.</li>
            <li>I love my new venus swirl razor.</li>
            <li>I was hoping a new technology would do better.</li>
            <li>I love this new razor.</li>
            <li>Very close shave, and the flexi-ball makes it easy to shave tricky areas like the knees.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use and left my skin so smooth!</li>
            <li>I have tried everything from the cheap 99 cents disposable razors to the more expensive disposable razors that one would find in Target, to the original Venus razor to an electric Remington razor and let me say the Venus Swirl is THE best I have tried thus far!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this razor!!!</li>
            <li>Although the handle is pretty!</li>
            <li>I had been using my trusty Venus Embrace for many years when I decided to replace it with something new and fun.</li>
            <li>Like I said I was very excited about receiving a new razor.</li>
            <li>It adds something pretty and special to my shaving routine.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Venus I got to try this product for free, along with the Venus Violet Swirl Shave Gel.</li>
            <li>I got a free sample of the product thanks to Gilette and BzzAgent, and I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now.</li>
            <li>I got to try the Venus Swirl for free thanks to Gillette.  </li>
            <li>I got this shaver for free on BZZ agent thanks to Gillette..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying this product for free thanks to Gillette.</li>
            <li>This summer, I&#x27;m looking forward to showing off my smooth shaved legs thanks to Gillette Venus Swirl.</li>
            <li>The MoistureGlide Serum really gives you a SUPERRRRR smooth shave.</li>
            <li>The razor sharpness has lasted for a few weeks though which is great.</li>
            <li>It even works amazingly well on the genital-area, no worries about leaving tiny cuts or having to do acrobatics and still miss some.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Venus, I got to try out this product for free.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclaimer: I was given this product to try for free thanks to Gillette.</li>
            <li>I just tried this for free thanks to Gillette.  </li>
            <li>I received this razor to try for free thanks to Venus and Bzzagent</li>
            <li>It has five blades  and a water activated serum around the whole razor head for and smooth moisturizing shave with out getting all slimy.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Gillette, I got to test this razor out for free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it a 4 star review because I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s that much better than what I was using before, the old Gillette Venus.</li>
            <li>The product is recommended to be used with soap or foam, however I only used water and happily there was no symptoms of irritation from sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I used it last night and thought hey this is nice.</li>
            <li>It glided across my skin like you would on a fresh ice skating rink...</li>
            <li>Worth the money</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase this on my own.</li>
            <li>The material of the handle also feels more sturdy than the old Venus handles.</li>
            <li>I was quite pleased and surprised.</li>
            <li>My mom would laugh at me because I&#x27;d come up from downstairs with 3-4 spot bandages on each leg to cover the knicks.</li>
            <li>This razor is so worth the price.</li>
            <li>So that is well worth the money as well.</li>
            <li>This razor left my legs silky smooth, razor burn free, and shiny!</li>
            <li>I rarely shave my legs because I am blond</li>
            <li>It is actually pretty cool.</li>
            <li>The actual shave felt nice-</li>
            <li>The gentle movement and swivel follows your body&#x27;s natural contour to get a nice close shave every time, everywhere.</li>
            <li>In my honest opinion it is a good razor - not great.</li>
            <li>First of all, the razor head gives a super close shave.</li>
            <li>and I was lucky enough to be able to try it for free thanks to Gillette.</li>
            <li>am i right?</li>
            <li>It drags very smooth and I can barely feel it across my skin.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I normally use disposable razors but loved the packaging as well as the look and feel of the actual razor.</li>
            <li>One thing I really like about this razor is that it easily captured the hair in a short amount of time, that I soon found myself enjoying the shave rather than seeing it as a chore.</li>
            <li>, it left my legs super smooth and my underarms bump/rash free.</li>
            <li>The packaging also makes it very easy to open the product.</li>
            <li>When I first got it I was super excited and had high expectations.</li>
            <li>And the &amp;#34;ball&amp;#34; is nothing special, it doesnt really work like the displays</li>
            <li>The ball on the handle really allows me to get those tricky spots just right!</li>
            <li>I was able to try this product for free thanks to Gillette and Bzz Agent as part of a promotion***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve probably used &amp;#34;men&#x27;s&amp;#34; disposable razors for the last 10 years</li>
            <li>I really loved the dark purple color.</li>
            <li>Overall, I will give the razor points for looking artsy and the nice feel of the handle, but for my needs, I found the razor head to be too bulky and it clogged up too fast for my liking.</li>
            <li>Overall, I will give the razor points for looking artsy and the nice feel of the handle, but for my needs, I found the razor head to be too bulky and it clogged up too fast for my liking.</li>
            <li>The moisture serum surrounding the blades could replace shaving cream entirely which is great for someone like me who likes to keep things simple.</li>
            <li>I just shaved with this last night and my legs are smooth and free of hair.</li>
            <li>Reaches every angle and leaves skin smooth and soft!  </li>
            <li>The serum creates a very smooth shave, especially since I do not prefer to use shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Normally I don&#x27;t fall for all the hype with new razors that claim to be special and unique</li>
            <li>I felt that if I were to use this regularly I’d be better off keeping a standard size razor around for that.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I felt that if I were to use this regularly I’d be better off keeping a standard size razor around for that.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>First time in YEARS that I havent gotten a razor burn.</li>
            <li>Also too much goop on the razor blade but will do the trick!</li>
            <li>I know that Venus is a top producer of female shaving products and I looked forward to the MoistureGlide component, but what I found was that this razor did not change my shaving routine at all.</li>
            <li>All in all, I do like the product and would recommend it as it is reusable and fares better than the disposable razors by the same name.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it it was like shaving with butter..</li>
            <li>And the flexible design is AWESOME and finally made it possible for me to not cut the back of my ankle.</li>
            <li>The MicroFine comb literally grabs each hair so there is no reason to go back over any area more than once.</li>
            <li>It left my legs full of stubble and not the smooth shave I was told.</li>
            <li>When I first used the razor</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like it the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it was on my legs</li>
            <li>The first night I inspected the razor itself before using it.</li>
            <li>Overall I really enjoyed this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty purple color with a shiny flexible roller.</li>
            <li>I have been able to use the blade for several weeks, and it continues to perform.</li>
            <li>I love also how this razor has a moisturizing barrier around the blades to help give me extra comfort.</li>
            <li>It only takes a couple swipes of the razor in the most stubborn spots to take it all and make it baby-smooth.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more refills.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the too wonderful feeling during shaving that makes you careless.</li>
            <li>This razor gave me a very close shave!</li>
            <li>I first got the razor,</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to buy more cartridges and permanently replace my current razor!</li>
            <li>Overall I love this razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Venus, but this is above and beyond :)</li>
            <li>I always thought, why should I pay more for a reusable razor when I can get about 5 bags of disposables for the same price?</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>This works pretty well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty violet color with a swirl design on the handle - oh, and the handle also has rubber grippy strips on the side which help when your hands have shave gel or soap on them.  </li>
            <li>I was not expecting it to be so slippy at first</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it in the shower on my legs/</li>
            <li>I had never seen a razor that was attached to a ball, and was interested in trying out.</li>
            <li>mens razors always provided the closest smoothest shave for me without cuts and now that I&#x27;ve gotten to try this razor, I am in love and never going back to men&#x27;s razors</li>
            <li>My legs were so smooth and soft like silk when I was done.</li>
            <li>So at first I thought this FlexiBall would be a gimmick.</li>
            <li>the razor seemed to glide pretty well.</li>
            <li>This gives such a great shave and doesn&#x27;t take a long time to remove your hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product and I would definitely recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li>Glad they have a money back guarantee!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a few and have loved them all.</li>
            <li>Very smooth on flat parts, but still misses on the curves.</li>
            <li>This razor is amazing, the flexiball technology gets those hard to reach areas easily without nicking my skin.</li>
            <li>so I can finally feel my nice soft legs again!</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the flex ball on the razor, although I thought that the flex ball would move a little more than it actually did.</li>
            <li>Other razors are cheaper but this one sounded amazing</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend it to those who have just started shaving, because the flexiball makes shaving your knees a breeze; but, to anyone who doesn&#x27;t need that kind of help, it isn&#x27;t really that much better than other brands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this razor a couple times, but so far it seems amazing.</li>
            <li>It is a pretty razor, but I don&#x27;t really care how pretty it is or what color it is.</li>
            <li>Its actually kind of fun to go from my ankle to my thigh without worrying about nicks or missing hair.</li>
            <li>I loved it the second and third time I used it though.</li>
            <li>I really liked the conditioner bars on the razor as it left my skin really soft after shaving.</li>
            <li>the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle allows movement &amp;#34;just enough&amp;#34; to the side to avoid nicks and cuts, and because it only moves side-to-side, it allows you to apply the right amount of pressure to ensure a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>My legs feel extra smooth right after I shave and that smoothness lasts longer.</li>
            <li>These 5-blad heads also fit other Gillette handles, and the 3 and 4-blade heads fit this ball handle</li>
            <li>me, the ball part is pretty much a gimmick.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Venus Embrace razors for a long time, and they&#x27;re my favorite razors.</li>
            <li>it comes with one cartilage and it has the ultimate movement for a perfect close shave even in the rough spots such as your Knees and ankles.  </li>
            <li>This is a combination that I am sure to use for a long time.</li>
            <li>The razor heads are already created to swivel to some degree, and most women have gotten so used to using a regular razor that the ball really doesn&#x27;t do a whole lot.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally splurge on razors, but this one is really worth the money.</li>
            <li>I realize that possibly that is how it has always been intended, but I have always been able to get almost two months out of one cartridge of the older models.  </li>
            <li>I easily get nicked every time I use this razor even when I am trying to be super careful.</li>
            <li>This razor gave me a very close shave - my legs are super soft in part due to the amazing moisture strip surrounding the cartridge head.  </li>
            <li>While I really liked the product overall, I was a bit dissapointed in the swirl ball, only because I thought it would move/swirl more than the tiny bit it did,</li>
            <li>I love that I was able to get my most difficult spots, my knees, with no trouble using this razor.</li>
            <li>When she used it for the first time it was so smooth that she thought it wasn&#x27;t actually doing anything, but when she finished her &amp;#34;shaving routine&amp;#34; all the hair was gone.</li>
            <li>Easy to open packaging when your eager to get your shave on!</li>
            <li>I was able to get all the spots I normally miss with a regular razor.</li>
            <li>The grip was also really good, but then again, I don&#x27;t have trouble holding my normal razor either.  </li>
            <li>Especially because I got to try it for FREE thanks to Gillette, I honestly don&#x27;t see myself using any other razor.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend it.)</li>
            <li>Behind the knees and under the arms were not as easy as I would of liked.  </li>
            <li>The FLEXIBALL, which is the major selling feature for it, though, wasn&#x27;t anything special.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a little cooler and more fun to use so the &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I was very very impressed with the way I was able to reach all of those hard to reach areas under my arms, knee caps and behind my needs.</li>
            <li>My wife really loves this razor.</li>
            <li>The lubricant on the cartridges works really well.</li>
            <li>She has always used, and really likes, &amp;#34;EOS Vanilla Bliss&amp;#34; shaving cream.</li>
            <li>The price was very competitive on Amazon</li>
            <li>I tried this razor thanks to Venus and bzzagent</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell if the ball has made much of a difference.</li>
            <li>I could just rinse, tap and be ready to go.</li>
            <li>I could just rinse, tap and be ready to go.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t move as much as I thought it would</li>
            <li>thanks to gillette venus</li>
            <li>It left my legs feeling like smooth silk</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t cut myself once and everything felt like a really close shave.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Bzz Agent</li>
            <li>I really like this razor.</li>
            <li>I tried this thanks to bzzagent, I always used venus</li>
            <li>this razor got to try it thanks to Venus and bzzagent for making it all happen.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend to all my friends.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t think that the underarm shave was very close because halfway through the day, I was developing a five-o&#x27;clock shadow under my arms.</li>
            <li>I really recommend trying this shaver.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor!</li>
            <li>I still highly recommend this razor!</li>
            <li>haha what a gimmick.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor!</li>
            <li>I received this razor as a free promotion and will defiantly purchase in the future to continue use.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t really see what it had to offer.</li>
            <li>It makes it so much easier to shave with it...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that the blade doesn&#x27;t need changed very often (been using 3 weeks and still a very close shave and not clogged with hair.)  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Buzzagent</li>
            <li>The ball really did help with the bikini area.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice all that much use of the ball on my legs though.</li>
            <li>Overall, I did enjoy this razor.</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t really add any benefit to my shave.</li>
            <li>It really helps to decrease razor burn.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Venus Swirl and Bzzagent, I got to try out this razor.</li>
            <li>So the ball really does nothing for me at all.  </li>
            <li>I really like this razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m left smooth and silky after each shave.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Gillette and BzzAgent</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this razor because it has already exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li>Recently I received this razor to try for free from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>But, I don&#x27;t the swirling ball part makes much of a difference.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I&#x27;d opt for the cheaper option - because this really doesn&#x27;t seem to have any functional improvement.</li>
            <li>It was a very close shave.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Gillette and BzzAgent</li>
            <li>I like the razor design and the shave is also really close.</li>
            <li>But the Venus Swirl absolutely has earned a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect there to be much difference...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor!</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t really.  </li>
            <li>I received this as a test product thanks to Venus</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>then that I really like this razor.</li>
            <li>and because you really don&#x27;t need to use soap or shave gel with it because it has it built in.  </li>
            <li>I went a whole month without shaving.</li>
            <li>I got a very close shave.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel like I knicked myself at all, and it was very painless.</li>
            <li>I really like it and it works well</li>
            <li>Not only does it leave my skin feeling so smooth</li>
            <li>This razor had a very chic look about it.</li>
            <li>Thanks Venus.</li>
            <li>and I was surprised im not afraid to shave my knees anymore</li>
            <li>heads cost a bit more, but I look for coupons and sales, and the heads do last considerably longer than the triple-blade versions, so cost per head sort of works out in the wash...</li>
            <li>This works just the same as every other Venus razor I&#x27;ve tried; which is very good, just nothing different.  </li>
            <li>Due to, I like how this razor is able to move, in different directions, and glides so smoothly.</li>
            <li>It works really well and Is better than other shavers.</li>
            <li>I really love this razor compared to the other Venus&#x27; I am used to using.  </li>
            <li>Is it better than any other 5 blade women&#x27;s razor?</li>
            <li>It also moves a lot more fluently due to the flexi ball.</li>
            <li>The moisture strip on it also doesnt get slimy lke other razors which  I LOVE.</li>
            <li>Other than that I like this razor and would recommend it to others :)</li>
            <li>It could be because I&#x27;m so used to having a routine to making sure I get the curves of my legs, such as with the knee and ankle, as no other razor has the swirl.</li>
            <li>The Venus Swirl with Flexiball worked to remove more hair the any other razor I have even used.</li>
            <li>The razor leaves my skin silky smooth with no irritation and also no major nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying this razor, it&#x27;s different than others and def worth trying</li>
            <li>As a working mom of two in the cooler months, taking the time needed to properly shave my legs is saved for special occasions that require me in a dress like funerals or holidays.</li>
            <li>It just glides around nicely, with very little effort on her part.</li>
            <li>so naturally I bought the womens version for my wife as soon as I was aware of this.</li>
            <li>Honestly the small amount of pivot at the ball probably makes no difference at all</li>
            <li>Not as cool as the commercial say.</li>
            <li>Many times, they would bleed so much that I would have to put on a larger bandage by the time I walked back upstairs.</li>
            <li>This Venus Swirl has 5 blades similar to my current razor, Schick Quadro, so I feel that is a good comparison - similar in the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li>one dislike: That purple part around the razor will sort of leak/rub off onto your counter top or in the shower when you set it down.</li>
            <li>The MoistureGlide is nice and left my skin feeling soft, but the effects are short lived and because of the high price tag on the item, I can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li>Mama found her new razor!</li>
            <li>I received the new Venus Swirl from BzzAgent!</li>
            <li>The razor itself is great (and I don&#x27;t think the razor for the venus swirl is any different than the one for the regular venus embrace other than the fact that it&#x27;s purple).</li>
            <li>I also really like the new shave gel that was released with the razor.</li>
            <li>and I can just buy new cartridges when I need one which is very convenient.</li>
            <li>They cost way too much to buy a new one every week.  </li>
            <li>The 5-blade heads really make quick work of stubble in a single pass, and you can usually go an extra day between shaves (as compared to twin or triple-head razors (even the original Venus).  </li>
            <li>, I am buying one of the older models....and will be looking into saving up for the Braun epilator soon</li>
            <li>, I am buying one of the older models....and will be looking into saving up for the Braun epilator soon</li>
            <li>The b&#x27;s just grow back so quickly.</li>
            <li>Love this razor- gets closer than any others I&#x27;ve tried on my underarms, which is a big deal for me, especially now that the weather is nicer and sleeveless is the way to go.</li>
            <li>There are 2 main downsides that I find in this razor.</li>
            <li>A main benefit of the Venus blade design is to shave shin-bone and ankle areas without taking a skin sample.</li>
            <li>I went in to this product with high hopes.</li>
            <li>However, the price of the replaceable blades is a bit too high, and is something that needs to be factored in.</li>
            <li>All in all, as a person who uses cartridge razors, I did like this one and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different razors that didn&#x27;t live up to their claims but this one actually gave me a close shave, even around my knees.</li>
            <li>Love love love, I usually use Gillette fusion, as a woman I have really coarse thick hair.</li>
            <li>Because it is positioned on a ball, it is very easy to get to places on my legs that I am normally not able to.</li>
            <li>I mean we shave more than they do!</li>
            <li>that does not mean my opinion is swayed at</li>
            <li>This is not to mention the &amp;#34;pits.&amp;#34; I also used this on my arm-pits and I did not have to go back and reshave my armpits after shaving the first times!</li>
            <li>It gives a smooth shave and doesn&#x27;t feel rough at all.</li>
            <li>And me already having sensitive skin, shaving cream isn&#x27;t much of an option for me.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised at how much a difference</li>
            <li>(but I actually ended up spending more in the long run).</li>
            <li>I am normally a bic soleil user.  </li>
            <li>I normally get razor burn in my bikini area with this razor</li>
            <li>I normally use men&#x27;s disposable razors.</li>
            <li>Normally shaving my armpits is a task</li>
            <li>It last a long time as long as you take good care of it</li>
            <li>I have, however, noticed body-stubble showing up after a few hours, but I think that&#x27;s more my body than the razor.</li>
            <li>And this was able to do it a few times before being demoted to arm pit razor.</li>
            <li>like I normally would.</li>
            <li>perhaps after a few more uses I will adjust to its movement better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shave lasted for days longer than my normal razor.</li>
            <li>but I decided to buy it instead of my normal $8 3 pack of disposables.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have known that the company offers 2x your money back if you aren&#x27;t satisfied because I definitely would have saved the receipt and box.</li>
            <li>First of all, I&#x27;m glad I bought this at Walmart instead of Amazon, because the price on Amazon is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li>It provided a very smooth shave and missed very little, if any hair.</li>
            <li>but I never seem to notice a huge difference that would make me HAVE to have this one over any of other Venus razors.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to see the roller ball, but it didn&#x27;t function in the way I expected.</li>
            <li>I am making this my new razor.  </li>
            <li>I will never again pinch pennies when it comes to razors, Gillette Venus is my new go to.</li>
            <li>the new  flexiball makes all the difference while shaving makes the curves and reach all the hair without burn razor marks and cuts  </li>
            <li>After 4-5 shaves, I was thinking that I needed a new razor.</li>
            <li>and I have tried each new one that comes out.</li>
            <li>But what&#x27;s new here?</li>
            <li>I have had an on again, off again relationship with Venus razors and feel as though they have redeemed themselves with this new razor.</li>
            <li>Yeah, knicking myself was a pain, but I figured it was just something I had to live with.</li>
            <li>Once I tried this razor, my skin was never cut and never irritated and it provided a super close shave that I have not experience in a long time!  </li>
            <li>And for all those women that always on the go wether you are a mom or business women always working long hours, no worries at all because you don&#x27;t have to change the razor head for whole MONTH!!</li>
            <li>I normally also have issues with missing places on my knees but this razor has made it SO easy to get all of the areas on my knees.</li>
            <li>I love the blade as usual.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sharper than most women&#x27;s razors I&#x27;ve used in the past</li>
            <li>I rarely have any complaints about razors as long as it does the job...</li>
            <li>No more cheap throwaway razors for me!</li>
            <li>I was really surprised!  </li>
            <li>Aside from the 5 blades, the other part that I love about this razor is the color and overall design.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>My only complaint is while the moisture strips were one of the best I have seen on a razor I am still not a huge fan of them.</li>
            <li>In addition, the MoistureGlide Serum left my skin feeling a whole new level of silky smooth-without using any shaving cream!  </li>
            <li>Works the same as other razors, good razor but not much flexibility</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a new razor for the shower, give this one a try, and I think you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised...</li>
            <li>and it has a long smooth lasting shave and even a lather or like a coating around the blades</li>
            <li>nothing special about that other than  making it not do what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li>It effortlessly reaches tough to shave bikini areas, and everything is super smooth.</li>
            <li>I am so in love with this razor - and it&#x27;s much less expensive than Intuition, which is even BETTER!</li>
            <li>To begin, I found the package it came in easy to open even with wet hands.</li>
            <li>I received this razor as part of a promotion and was skeptical of how well it would do, as I have been a loyal customer of another razor for many years.</li>
            <li>The tab in the back made it super convenient to actually USE the product you just purchased - what a thought!</li>
            <li>She liked it and it replaced it previous razor brand which was a tad more expensive.</li>
            <li>I think if the blades were a little sharper it would have made a HUGE difference in the shave.</li>
            <li>The handle is also less slippery than the Body handle or Original Venus handle.  </li>
            <li>Just wish the ball had a little more movement than it does currently!</li>
            <li>This product is AMAZING, it not only gets all the hard to get places</li>
            <li>Instead, I found myself using the jet setting on the shower head and even using my thumb at times after each pass to try and clear the blade area and</li>
            <li>Instead, I found myself using the jet setting on the shower head and even using my thumb at times after each pass to try and clear the blade area and</li>
            <li>, I feel the razor should last me longer than a few times and give me just the same amazing shave.  </li>
            <li>One thing that I didn’t really like is that after the shave, although my skin did feel smooth, there was still some red stubble, which went away after a few hours.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how well it shaved my legs.</li>
            <li>I can ditch my old razors.  </li>
            <li>but it makes your skin so soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>I used to only buy disposables because they were much cheaper</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I image a professional brainstorming session with someone suggesting something along the lines of &amp;#34;Let&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I feel the real star of this razor is the freakishly big razor head.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your  money.</li>
            <li>This ball thing on the razor is a complete joke.</li>
            <li>Overall I got a very close shave with no cuts or razor burns even underarms.  </li>
            <li>I continued to have to shave my legs everyday in order to stay smooth.</li>
            <li>The blades did not hurt the skin at all and instead left my skin feeling soft and smooth, plus the flexiball helped in shaving the harder to shave areas, like under the armpit, bikini line, and around the elbows and knees.</li>
            <li>The ball in the handle allows smooth gliding even over trouble areas.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t move much but it&#x27;s enough that I haven&#x27;t knicked myself on my knees or heel.</li>
            <li>burn 9 out of 10 razors give me, but with the Venus Swirl that is far from the case.</li>
            <li>but if you have sensitive skin I would probably not purchase.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find this was not the case.</li>
            <li>No knicks, no razor burn, and so far no ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used on my legs twice so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a mom of an 8 month old</li>
            <li>It shaves so close and leaves my skin feeling so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>the only problem I have is it sometimes moves too much.  </li>
            <li>I recently got this in the mail thanks to BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>This razor produced so a soft, close shave.</li>
            <li>This razor really helped eliminate cuts while shaving, especially on my knees, because of the way it moves!</li>
            <li>My old razor had a rubber type grip over and under the razor.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this razor that I received through Gillette and a bzzagent campaign.</li>
            <li>However, contrary to what I believed the flexiball does not rotate at a 360 degree angle, and instead only moves from right to left.</li>
            <li>the ball only rotates right or left (like opening a door knob).</li>
            <li>The razor only moves left or right around the ball</li>
            <li>(my trick is to wash my razor&#x27;s after each use with hot water and an antibacterial soap, let dry completely and keep in a drawer).  </li>
            <li>The only problem I, personally, have with it is that if you have sensitive skin (such as myself), you pretty much HAVE to use shaving gel.</li>
            <li>It was super smooth &amp; I was able to get to all the tight spots and didn&#x27;t have to worry at all about cutting myself.</li>
            <li>The 5 blades get every single hair, the flexiball makes shaving around your ankles, by your knees and under your arms so much easier!</li>
            <li>I used to use a different razor, Schick Intuition, for quite a while, probably somewhere around 6 or 7 years, but this razor proved to me why it should be my new razor!</li>
            <li>I am in love with this razor it seriously leaves my skin</li>
            <li>The more I use the razor the more I don&#x27;t like it. :(</li>
            <li>Previously, I was loyal to the Venus Embrace razor.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it to any woman, especially those who need a closer shave around the knee and ankle.  </li>
            <li>At nearly $28/box of 6 (on Amazon), the cartridges are some of the most expensive on the market and, from what I can tell, do not warrant that very high price tag.</li>
            <li>Most razors I&#x27;ve used become slimy after only a few shaves, but the Moisture Glide serum on this actually hasn&#x27;t yet.</li>
            <li>best razor I&#x27;ve ever used, just wish it were less expensive!</li>
            <li>If I needed to buy a new razor and this and the Venus Embrace were the same price I might grab this again just for the comfier handle and prettier look.</li>
            <li>I usually tend to buy the cheap dollar general razors and often come out of the shower with razor burns.</li>
            <li>I also like that the blades last pretty long.</li>
            <li>My only issue was that although I loved the close shave of the Venus Embrace razor, sometimes I would angle the razor incorrectly, press a little too hard, shave a little too quickly, and end up digging a chunk of my skin off of my body.</li>
            <li>style marketing made a sucker out of me, but really the price is low enough that buying one just to have was justified.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like a ball forcing the head side-to-side, but I&#x27;m amazed at the control you have with this razor, even over tough spots (like ankles and knees), as well as more &amp;#34;delicate&amp;#34; areas.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It took a little getting used to how much it moves around, especially with how slippery it was, and with how much I rush in the shower.  </li>
            <li>it is pretty average.</li>
            <li>I find that I hold my razor near the head anyway, above the ball, to get a closer shave.  </li>
            <li>It only works when your skin is in water, like directly under a shower stream or in a bath.  </li>
            <li>No matter how much shave cream I used or how careful I tried to be, I always ended up with knicks on both my legs.</li>
            <li>I never really paid much attention to non-disposable razors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once so far though, so</li>
            <li>I &amp;#34;borrowed&amp;#34; my husband&#x27;s &amp;#34;man-razors&amp;#34; which is apparently frowned upon.  </li>
            <li>It removed all the hair and left no bumps as I&#x27;m really sensitive there.</li>
            <li>I will be buying refill blades in the near future.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair which can sometimes be difficult for shaving because it bends so close to the skin that razors go right over the top without cutting the hair.</li>
            <li>Later, I found the Venus Snap travel size handle and was pretty excited because I was less likely to snap the little handle.</li>
            <li>Super close shave and the blade can actually be reused quit a few times.</li>
            <li>Just because it doesn&#x27;t cut me doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m going to let it pass on giving me a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I first received this product, I was excited and a bit skeptical.</li>
            <li>The cheap, soft plastic material just wasn&#x27;t very durable for the few times you accidentally press too hard.</li>
            <li>The blades last super long like other Venus blades.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see a difference in it than the other razors.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t really notice a difference in this razor and my other Venus embrace razor.</li>
            <li>so you can get a clean shave those hard to shave areas like your knees.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but it already is my favorite razor, hands down.</li>
            <li>So, overall, I am pleased with this razor but it is equal to other Venus razors; no huge breakthrough here.</li>
            <li>and I love this razor because the lotion strips on the blade and the flexible structure make it so easy to shave without cutting yourself or missing any hair.</li>
            <li>However, the handle only moves right to left instead of up and down</li>
            <li>Shaving your knees and lower leg can be a little tricky but the ball helps so much !</li>
            <li>Only complaint I have is I don&#x27;t think the blades last as long as most.</li>
            <li>At first I had a regular razor handle, but all of those snapped in half.</li>
            <li>The shave is alright, no better really though than my old Schick Hydro-silk.</li>
            <li>I have been using my old razor for so long and was definitely in need of a change.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel itchy and dry after shaving - I feel it is definitely not for people with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>All of the hype over the little flex ball thing is really for nothing.</li>
            <li>I normally am not impressed with razors other than the one I normally use, HOWEVER, this one gives a fantastically close shave and leaves your legs looking and feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The packaging is easy to open -  no struggling with sharp, hard plastic.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a great experience with reusable razors.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think there was a great deal of difference between razors before now.</li>

            <li> This razor is amazing and awesome</li>
            <li> The flexiball technology gives great motion for those knee caps, armpits, and boney ankles.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor that gives the closeness of a man&#x27;s razor.</li>
            <li> As a mom I love this razor!!</li>
            <li> I took a shower and tried it again and still could not get my legs smooth at all!!!</li>
            <li> Love it!!</li>
            <li> The five blades are very nice too, but I like that with the razor handle</li>
            <li> Results on my legs and Pitts are amazing!  </li>

            <li> This is a wonderful product that I will be for sure using and purchasing again.</li>
            <li> This is an exceptional product and is greatly improved.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to grip, the flexi ball provides the best movement you can ask for in a razor.</li>
            <li> It can swivel in all directions, so she doesn&#x27;t have to work to get it to do a good job.</li>
            <li> This razor is just as good as any of the Venus razors.</li>
            <li> I received it from Bzzagent to test and review for free and it is a great product!</li>
            <li> Personally I loved this.</li>
            <li> The shave is just as good on day 14 as it was on day 1.</li>
            <li> I loved the grip on the handle and the ease of use.  </li>

            <li> but I also use a good shaving cream, NOT soap, and don&#x27;t rush</li>
            <li> I loved this razor.</li>
            <li> I loved the Violet Swirl shaving gel from Gilette and Olay.</li>
            <li> and she loved it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also delighted that I can finish using the blades from my Embrace razor with the Swirl</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good quality and gives a close shave.</li>
            <li> It does glide fairly well over the knee area though.</li>
            <li> Really good razor.</li>
            <li> Leaves ur skin feels so good.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe I just didn&#x27;t do a good job shaving</li>
            <li> I received the Venus Swirl Razor from the brand and I loved it.</li>
            <li> She says they work good on her legs but give her razor burn under her arms.  </li>
            <li> but now I get excited to shave because it&#x27;s the BEST razor</li>

            <li> This is an amazing razor.</li>
            <li> So that was amazing and</li>
            <li> This razor is amazing</li>
            <li> And likewise it shaves smoothly across my scalp without the scrapes I was getting from otherwise great blades designed for shaving a face.</li>
            <li> Mach-3 Turbo&amp;#34;, which she liked,</li>
            <li> and I honestly recommend this to anyone.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t think that I will find another razor that is this nice.</li>
            <li> It is kind of on the pricey side at $11.47</li>
            <li> and this came in handy for me when I ran out of shave gel and didn&#x27;t want to hop out of the shower to get another can.</li>
            <li> it will probably make it the ABSOLUTE perfect shave.</li>
            <li> All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I honestly wouldn&#x27;t have purchased yet another razor I knew wouldn&#x27;t do the job.  </li>

            <li> and I really liked how it worked on my underarms.  </li>
            <li> I also liked the way the moisturizing strips make my skin feel.  </li>
            <li> Glides so nicely over legs.</li>
            <li> I did not receive any kind of cover for my razor which would be nice so that it doesn&#x27;t rust.</li>
            <li> , this is my own review and experience with the Gillette Venus swirl razor.    </li>
            <li> And no I wasn&#x27;t paid to give this review, if I didn&#x27;t like the razor I would be honest and say I didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> No cutting yourself, just beautiful smoothness.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone looking for a new 5 blade razor that is flexiable and will provide an excellent close shave.</li>

            <li> I received it from Venus to try and I am so glad they did because I am in love with Venus again!  </li>
            <li> It smells good and helps deliver a smooth shave.)</li>
            <li> by far one of the best razors I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The Venus Swirl razor is by far the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used!  </li>
            <li> So glad I did as this razor is amazing.</li>
            <li> It was the most amazing razor handle I have used.</li>
            <li> Being a women, it sure is nice that there is a product out there can help.</li>
            <li> I do still use shaving gel with it, but the moisture bar on the razor is also nice in terms of the razor gliding with more ease.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely convinced this is the best razor for women out there.</li>
            <li> Wow, this was probably the best razor that I have ever used!  </li>
            <li> All in all, I still love my Schick Hydro Silk, but the Gillette Venus Swirl is an amazing addition.</li>
            <li> I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting this razor to deliver everything that it claimed, because most cartridge razors don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I tend to nick and cut myself with shaving and between the good grip and smooth feet, I don&#x27;t need to worry about that anymore.</li>
            <li> This razor is perfect for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this amazing product for free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I just would have liked to see the ball move around a bit more than it did.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> :) also the shaving cream smells amazing too</li>
            <li> It feels good in her hand, and the razor is also very pretty, with the nice purplish color and all the swirls.</li>
            <li> Love how cute the razor is and it works even better than it looks!</li>
            <li> I used it right after I received it from Bzzagent and was super impressed.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good razor for a while and was excited to try this.</li>
            <li> The contour blades do a good job at getting stubble, and getting a close clean shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy to have the chance to try the Venus Swirl for free, thanks to Buzz Agent and Venus and Gillette.</li>

            <li> Very smooth shave</li>
            <li> I know that the cartridges may seem like a steep price when looking at the quantity, but the quality is worth it (and the color is pretty great too)!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful it is easy to use and gives you a close soft shave.  </li>
            <li> Also, I am not scared with the razor to shave my armpits, knees, ankles and bikini area, and it does not get irritated, which is a huge relief for me!  </li>
            <li> Love the 5 blades instead of the 4 I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> but she thinks the &amp;#34;Venus Swirl&amp;#34; is better.</li>

            <li> I love that this has 5 blades</li>

            <li> I LOVE MY GILLETTE VENUS SWIRL RAZOR😍</li>
            <li> I genuinely LOVE this razor.</li>
            <li> Having used multiple razors I have always been most impressed with Gillette Venus Products.</li>
            <li> but I probably wouldn&#x27;t spend the money on it unless I was able to combine a sale with a coupon.</li>
            <li> I love how the head swivels also..</li>
            <li> I love that the ball helps contour the razor to my body.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m still in love with the Venus Swirl</li>
            <li> Love this razor.</li>
            <li> The second time on my armpits and it worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li> and I love the soap around the edge.</li>
            <li> I could never figure out why men have better razors than women do,</li>
            <li> My favorite part of this razor is the cartridge.</li>
            <li> Love this razor.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> This Razor is awesome because it leaves no hair and keeps your legs soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It has 5 blades and the more blades the better.</li>
            <li> these razors glide with my curves and give me a nice smooth shave.</li>
            <li> on top of it there is a swril ball</li>
            <li> I was able to try this razor.</li>
            <li> I was still able to finish shaving my legs with a smooth shave!</li>
            <li> I love the ball and that it lets the razor glide over every part of my legs to ensure an even shave.</li>
            <li> It hugged the curves of my body better, giving me a better shave and experience.</li>
            <li> This product has taken the &amp;#34;chore&amp;#34; of shaving and turned it into an enjoyable pampering experience.</li>
            <li> For more of my product reviews and buying guides, visit: http://melindalongoria.hubpages.com/</li>
            <li> received this sample for free and agreed to give an honest opinion</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know how many times I knicked one of them, and it started to bleed.</li>
            <li> I love the lubrastrip.</li>
            <li> My legs feel smooth and amazing.</li>
            <li> I love the flexball design of this razor blade.</li>
            <li> I love that this has 5 blades</li>
            <li> In fact it glides so smoothly that it doesn&#x27;t even feel like you are shaving, but you are!</li>
            <li> I have to make sure</li>
            <li> I can just buy a variety more to my liking and still use this lovely handle.  </li>
            <li> and I love it and will buy the refills for it.</li>
            <li> never thought a razor would be able to do that</li>
            <li> Very impressed with the comfort of the handle, the closeness of the shave, and the overall appearance of my skin post-shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My favorite part about this razor is the MoistureGlide serum.  </li>
            <li> and I love the swivel head.</li>
            <li> I was highly pleased with how moisturizing the moisture strip was.</li>
            <li> Purple happens to be my favorite color.</li>
            <li> am in love with this one.</li>
            <li> But then BzzAgent came along and asked me if I wanted to be part of the campaign where Gillette would so kindly give one of these away for free for us to try.</li>
            <li> but I was expecting the silver pivoting head to move a lot more than it did.  </li>
            <li> I tried 2 more days in a row, with soap and without</li>
            <li> The aspect I like the most and was not expecting, was the purple part that sits around the blades.</li>
            <li> Love the color.</li>
            <li> I bought this on impulse thinking it would be just ok.</li>
            <li> the swirl ball makes -- this was actually the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I could do this!&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite razor in ages.</li>
            <li> To top it off it&#x27;s my favorite color purple</li>
            <li> Love this razor it has given me the closest shave yet and the smoothest LOVE VENUS</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the close shave that I got and</li>
            <li> Glides ever so smooth and no Knicks!</li>
            <li> I never thought my legs could be so smooth!</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of the best razors I have used before!  </li>
            <li> you are able to use any variety of the Venus razor replacement blades.</li>
            <li> After trying many razors i would recommend this for sure.</li>
            <li> I actually enjoy shaving my legs!</li>
            <li> It is advertised to pivot in ways that make shaving easier and more efficient.</li>
            <li> I will definitely get more cartridges for this great Venus handle!</li>
            <li> but I do appreciate Venus trying to create a better razor.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Overall, I really love this razor!!!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try it</li>
            <li> I was hoping to love the new one because i thought, I love Venus and one that swivels would be an even better version great.</li>
            <li> Great new razor!  </li>
            <li> What makes this razor stand apart is the flexibility of the blades to more easily shape my leg and pull more hair while shaving.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Venus for letting me try this amazing razor!</li>
            <li> First off, my armpits have never looked so good.</li>
            <li> This is the best shave I&#x27;ve gotten in a long time.</li>
            <li> Over all this razor was pretty good.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see the five blade for girls!</li>
            <li> I love the rubbery handle that made it easy to grip the razor.  </li>
            <li> This razor gives the closest shave I&#x27;ve gotten in a while and left my legs silky smooth with all those awesome blades</li>
            <li> First, it is very stylish; I love the way it looks.  </li>
            <li> actual shaving Part with this razor resulted in smooth and flawless shave</li>
            <li> I have fallen in love with this razor, I did not buy it off Amazon because I got it free to review</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great as far as razors go.</li>
            <li> I was able to test out this razor, plus the shaving cream for free</li>
            <li> I literally had to check to see if it was actually touching my skin and shaving my hair, that&#x27;s how smooth it was.</li>
            <li> all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this razor to glide a lot more smoothly than anticipated.</li>
            <li> , I think you should use shaving cream, but it still went smoothly and I was able to shave my legs without any dryness or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> and I am still smooth and stubble free!</li>
            <li> I was recently able to try this razor free from Gillette and let me tell you,</li>
            <li> I love that it moves to fit the contours of my legs.</li>
            <li> I got to try these free from the company which makes this even better.</li>
            <li> I love it so much !!!</li>
            <li> I am super impressed with this and definitely will continue using it.</li>
            <li> and I can confidently say it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li> but it is super easy to use!</li>
            <li> I got it for free thanks to Venus, and it is the best new razor out there.</li>
            <li> and it cut through my neglected leg hair easily.</li>
            <li> so easy to shave and</li>
            <li> but it glides over your body so easily.</li>
            <li> The Flexiball technology makes shaving my knees so easy and painless.  </li>
            <li> but this was so easy because of the movement of the head</li>
            <li> One of my favorite features is the MoistureGlide serum which makes the blade effortlessly glide over your skin for a smooth moisturized silky smooth shave.</li>
            <li> The flex ball technology makes it so easy to shave the contours of your legs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy and comfortable to use and gets the job quickly.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to get the Venus swirl razor from BZZAGENT for free to provide my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I did not feel as though my shave was quite as nice and quite as close as it was the first two times</li>
            <li> The flexi-ball technology allows the razor blade to pivot both up and down and side to side, allowing for excellent skin coverage.  </li>
            <li> I loved this new razor .  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more cartridges and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use my own throat sore again!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice any kind of closer or better shave than I normally get with another Venus.</li>
            <li> The design was light and slim and It was easy to hold and handle.  </li>
            <li> I got cut and the lotion line on top is already all most gone after first use.</li>
            <li> Typically I do not shave as often during the winter, like most women I know, and this razor, with one swip, was able to remove the hair and leave a nice smooth feeling on my legs.</li>
            <li> easy shave with smooth results.</li>
            <li> I was quickly drawn to the textured, purple handle and its artsy pattern that is pleasing to look at and efficient for gripping.</li>
            <li> And the Venus Swirl&#x27;s five contour blades give a super close shave and leave my legs feeling so smooth!  </li>
            <li> I was able to shave quickly and so close</li>
            <li> When trying out this razor it occurred to me quickly that it wasn&#x27;t quite as flexible as advertised, it seemed to do the job very well and with accuracy, but I still would of liked more flexibility.</li>
            <li> I was a fan of the awesome little comb-nubs before the blades making even the shortest of  hair stand up.</li>
            <li> Gillette was kind enough to give me a free sample of Venus Swirl and I am so glad they did!  </li>
            <li> This was my first promotion that I received from BzzAgent, and I could not have been more excited!</li>

            <li> It really made the process quicker and more enjoyable.</li>
            <li> I love the flex ball because it really does allow the razor head to move better around my knee area which I often cut.</li>
            <li> After using only two blade disposable razors this is absolutely the best my legs have ever felt!</li>
            <li> It really made the process quicker and more enjoyable.</li>
            <li> I also loved how cute the actual razor was.</li>
            <li> The only reason i put 4 stars is because the head didnt move as much as i had anticipated but it is a wonderful razor</li>
            <li> The design on the handle is even cute, my husband loved the way my legs felt and the shave and smoothness lasted longer than with most other razors I have tried.</li>

            <li> but lets just say that I found my new favorite razor!</li>
            <li> I found the head super easy to clean as I was using it as well.</li>
            <li> FUN!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this razor that I got to try courtesy of Gillette and Bzzagent.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited about receiving the Gillette Venus Swirl from Bzzagent as a way to review the product.</li>
            <li> and I love this razor SO much!</li>
            <li> first, when I saw ads for the Venus Rollerball, I thought it was just going to be a gimmick, but I bought it on impulse at Target, and I&#x27;m really glad I did.</li>
            <li> And I have to say, I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try it because I&#x27;m always looking for a closer shave.</li>
            <li> so I was excited to give the Venus Swirl a try.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited to have the option of a swirl razor handle, that would make it easier to get into those hard-to-reach areas.</li>
            <li> so I used the razor again, made sure I was nice and smooth and didn&#x27;t miss any spots but again, by the next day I was prickly.</li>
            <li> No more razor knicks on my knees or ankles, which is awesome.</li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent and Gillette, I got this sweet puppy in the mail!!</li>
            <li> the flexiball really made it easy to shave around my ankle and knee cap without any nicks!</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to get to try The Venus Swirl for free and it&#x27;s absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get them clean.</li>
            <li> I received my product free from bzz agent but free or not it&#x27;s definitely worth what you would pay for it</li>
            <li> My legs are super smooth &amp; I don&#x27;t feel like I missed a spot since the razor moved with my body.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this razor out for free through a promotion (BzzAgent) thanks to Gillette</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I had the opportunity to try it, though, because it really did make a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Before I got this product I wanted to know how well it removes hair and gives you a clean shave.</li>
            <li> She already uses a Venus brand (disposable) razor and wasn&#x27;t sure the experience would get much better, but she was pleasantly surprised by the movement and close shave of this razor.</li>
            <li> It was even easy to shave my knees :) I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I liked that the cartridge comes with its own little container and easily attaches and removes itself from the razor.</li>
            <li> It was very comfortable to hold and the shave I got was very close considering.</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> The handle, however, is nothing special.</li>
            <li> I would probably purchase the replacement blades for the product again to use during special occasions- since refills are costly for my budget-21.00 for a package of 4.</li>
            <li> That being said, this one was nothing special.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s job, just don&#x27;t expect anything special because of the pivoting</li>
            <li> like I said, it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li> Incredibly better than my older version of Venus!  </li>
            <li> So I was super excited when I saw an ad on tv that Gillette was coming out with a flexball version for women.</li>
            <li> and Would totally recommend this to ANYONE who would like a nice, close and clean shave!</li>
            <li> That being said, it functions great as a regular razor, so that&#x27;s exactly what you&#x27;ll get.</li>
            <li> However, not so sure the ball really adds anything to this.</li>
            <li> It does have 5 blades compared to 3 in my old one and it glides/handles nicely.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this thanks to bzzagent.com.  </li>
            <li> I was not so sure about spending  so much on a razor.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that they really provide any better results than a disposable.</li>
            <li> I bought it on Amazon because the prime price was $4 cheaper than my drugstore, so overall it was a good deal, even if it does not work as &amp;#34;swirly&amp;#34; as it is advertised.</li>
            <li> I was able to use this razor thanks to Gillette.</li>
            <li> I was able to try the Venus swirl thanks to a sample from Venus.</li>
            <li> I was able to test this razor out thanks to Gillett and bzzagent.</li>
            <li> This looked cool, so</li>
            <li> but it does last a good bit of time.</li>
            <li> I was able to use this razor thanks to Gillette and BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> Smoothest my legs ever been next to a good wax job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good razor and I will be using it regularly from now on, but</li>
            <li> I was able to use this razor thanks to Gillette and BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li> I was able to get this razor thanks to BzzAgent.com.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Thanks to Gillete and Bzzagent, I was able to receive this product as part of a promotion.</li>
            <li> I  Think it&#x27;s such a good looking razor that it makes me want to shave my legs instead of</li>
            <li> First and foremost, I love the packaging that it came in, which right away tells you what the product is about.</li>
            <li> Best of all, no more knicks!</li>
            <li> So easy to use, and just as it&#x27;s advertised it makes shaving the curves and contours of your body much easier!</li>
            <li> The blades themselves are as sharp as mens which is great for getting a close shave.</li>
            <li> Glad to say I&#x27;ve found one :) the only mishap I don&#x27;t like about the razor is I don&#x27;t like the handle.</li>
            <li> It gives a super close shave and no razor burn.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really feel like I was shaving, but when I was done a had a smooth, close, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t think the razor is anything more special than any other razor on the market.</li>
            <li> again, I am in love with this razor and would highly recommend giving it a try.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited when I got to try the Venus Swirl for free thanks to Gillette.</li>
            <li> , it is a very pretty, sleek design.</li>
            <li> It is very pretty, and caught my eye.</li>
            <li> I tried this product free thanks to Gillette!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying this product for free thanks to Venus!</li>
            <li> It also has a long handle with a good grip so no slip.</li>
            <li> Gillette is always on edge when it comes to new and innovative technology.</li>
            <li> I love my new venus swirl razor.</li>
            <li> I was hoping a new technology would do better.</li>
            <li> I love this new razor.</li>
            <li> Very close shave, and the flexi-ball makes it easy to shave tricky areas like the knees.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use and left my skin so smooth!</li>
            <li> I have tried everything from the cheap 99 cents disposable razors to the more expensive disposable razors that one would find in Target, to the original Venus razor to an electric Remington razor and let me say the Venus Swirl is THE best I have tried thus far!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this razor!!!</li>
            <li> Although the handle is pretty!</li>
            <li> I had been using my trusty Venus Embrace for many years when I decided to replace it with something new and fun.</li>
            <li> Like I said I was very excited about receiving a new razor.</li>
            <li> It adds something pretty and special to my shaving routine.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Venus I got to try this product for free, along with the Venus Violet Swirl Shave Gel.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of the product thanks to Gilette and BzzAgent, and I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now.</li>
            <li> I got to try the Venus Swirl for free thanks to Gillette.  </li>
            <li> I got this shaver for free on BZZ agent thanks to Gillette..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying this product for free thanks to Gillette.</li>
            <li> This summer, I&#x27;m looking forward to showing off my smooth shaved legs thanks to Gillette Venus Swirl.</li>
            <li> The MoistureGlide Serum really gives you a SUPERRRRR smooth shave.</li>
            <li> The razor sharpness has lasted for a few weeks though which is great.</li>
            <li> It even works amazingly well on the genital-area, no worries about leaving tiny cuts or having to do acrobatics and still miss some.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to Venus, I got to try out this product for free.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclaimer: I was given this product to try for free thanks to Gillette.</li>
            <li> I just tried this for free thanks to Gillette.  </li>
            <li> I received this razor to try for free thanks to Venus and Bzzagent</li>
            <li> It has five blades  and a water activated serum around the whole razor head for and smooth moisturizing shave with out getting all slimy.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Gillette, I got to test this razor out for free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it a 4 star review because I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s that much better than what I was using before, the old Gillette Venus.</li>
            <li> The product is recommended to be used with soap or foam, however I only used water and happily there was no symptoms of irritation from sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I used it last night and thought hey this is nice.</li>
            <li> It glided across my skin like you would on a fresh ice skating rink...</li>
            <li> Worth the money</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase this on my own.</li>
            <li> The material of the handle also feels more sturdy than the old Venus handles.</li>
            <li> I was quite pleased and surprised.</li>
            <li> My mom would laugh at me because I&#x27;d come up from downstairs with 3-4 spot bandages on each leg to cover the knicks.</li>
            <li> This razor is so worth the price.</li>
            <li> So that is well worth the money as well.</li>
            <li> This razor left my legs silky smooth, razor burn free, and shiny!</li>
            <li> I rarely shave my legs because I am blond</li>
            <li> It is actually pretty cool.</li>
            <li> The actual shave felt nice-</li>
            <li> The gentle movement and swivel follows your body&#x27;s natural contour to get a nice close shave every time, everywhere.</li>
            <li> In my honest opinion it is a good razor - not great.</li>
            <li> First of all, the razor head gives a super close shave.</li>
            <li> and I was lucky enough to be able to try it for free thanks to Gillette.</li>
            <li> am i right?</li>
            <li> It drags very smooth and I can barely feel it across my skin.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I normally use disposable razors but loved the packaging as well as the look and feel of the actual razor.</li>
            <li> One thing I really like about this razor is that it easily captured the hair in a short amount of time, that I soon found myself enjoying the shave rather than seeing it as a chore.</li>
            <li> , it left my legs super smooth and my underarms bump/rash free.</li>
            <li> The packaging also makes it very easy to open the product.</li>
            <li> When I first got it I was super excited and had high expectations.</li>
            <li> And the &amp;#34;ball&amp;#34; is nothing special, it doesnt really work like the displays</li>
            <li> The ball on the handle really allows me to get those tricky spots just right!</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free thanks to Gillette and Bzz Agent as part of a promotion***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve probably used &amp;#34;men&#x27;s&amp;#34; disposable razors for the last 10 years</li>
            <li> I really loved the dark purple color.</li>
            <li> Overall, I will give the razor points for looking artsy and the nice feel of the handle, but for my needs, I found the razor head to be too bulky and it clogged up too fast for my liking.</li>
            <li> Overall, I will give the razor points for looking artsy and the nice feel of the handle, but for my needs, I found the razor head to be too bulky and it clogged up too fast for my liking.</li>
            <li> The moisture serum surrounding the blades could replace shaving cream entirely which is great for someone like me who likes to keep things simple.</li>
            <li> I just shaved with this last night and my legs are smooth and free of hair.</li>
            <li> Reaches every angle and leaves skin smooth and soft!  </li>
            <li> The serum creates a very smooth shave, especially since I do not prefer to use shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t fall for all the hype with new razors that claim to be special and unique</li>
            <li> I felt that if I were to use this regularly I’d be better off keeping a standard size razor around for that.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I felt that if I were to use this regularly I’d be better off keeping a standard size razor around for that.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> First time in YEARS that I havent gotten a razor burn.</li>
            <li> Also too much goop on the razor blade but will do the trick!</li>
            <li> I know that Venus is a top producer of female shaving products and I looked forward to the MoistureGlide component, but what I found was that this razor did not change my shaving routine at all.</li>
            <li> All in all, I do like the product and would recommend it as it is reusable and fares better than the disposable razors by the same name.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it it was like shaving with butter..</li>
            <li> And the flexible design is AWESOME and finally made it possible for me to not cut the back of my ankle.</li>
            <li> The MicroFine comb literally grabs each hair so there is no reason to go back over any area more than once.</li>
            <li> It left my legs full of stubble and not the smooth shave I was told.</li>
            <li> When I first used the razor</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it was on my legs</li>
            <li> The first night I inspected the razor itself before using it.</li>
            <li> Overall I really enjoyed this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty purple color with a shiny flexible roller.</li>
            <li> I have been able to use the blade for several weeks, and it continues to perform.</li>
            <li> I love also how this razor has a moisturizing barrier around the blades to help give me extra comfort.</li>
            <li> It only takes a couple swipes of the razor in the most stubborn spots to take it all and make it baby-smooth.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more refills.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the too wonderful feeling during shaving that makes you careless.</li>
            <li> This razor gave me a very close shave!</li>
            <li> I first got the razor,</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to buy more cartridges and permanently replace my current razor!</li>
            <li> Overall I love this razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Venus, but this is above and beyond :)</li>
            <li> I always thought, why should I pay more for a reusable razor when I can get about 5 bags of disposables for the same price?</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> This works pretty well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty violet color with a swirl design on the handle - oh, and the handle also has rubber grippy strips on the side which help when your hands have shave gel or soap on them.  </li>
            <li> I was not expecting it to be so slippy at first</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it in the shower on my legs/</li>
            <li> I had never seen a razor that was attached to a ball, and was interested in trying out.</li>
            <li> mens razors always provided the closest smoothest shave for me without cuts and now that I&#x27;ve gotten to try this razor, I am in love and never going back to men&#x27;s razors</li>
            <li> My legs were so smooth and soft like silk when I was done.</li>
            <li> So at first I thought this FlexiBall would be a gimmick.</li>
            <li> the razor seemed to glide pretty well.</li>
            <li> This gives such a great shave and doesn&#x27;t take a long time to remove your hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I would definitely recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> Glad they have a money back guarantee!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few and have loved them all.</li>
            <li> Very smooth on flat parts, but still misses on the curves.</li>
            <li> This razor is amazing, the flexiball technology gets those hard to reach areas easily without nicking my skin.</li>
            <li> so I can finally feel my nice soft legs again!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the flex ball on the razor, although I thought that the flex ball would move a little more than it actually did.</li>
            <li> Other razors are cheaper but this one sounded amazing</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend it to those who have just started shaving, because the flexiball makes shaving your knees a breeze; but, to anyone who doesn&#x27;t need that kind of help, it isn&#x27;t really that much better than other brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this razor a couple times, but so far it seems amazing.</li>
            <li> It is a pretty razor, but I don&#x27;t really care how pretty it is or what color it is.</li>
            <li> Its actually kind of fun to go from my ankle to my thigh without worrying about nicks or missing hair.</li>
            <li> I loved it the second and third time I used it though.</li>
            <li> I really liked the conditioner bars on the razor as it left my skin really soft after shaving.</li>
            <li> the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle allows movement &amp;#34;just enough&amp;#34; to the side to avoid nicks and cuts, and because it only moves side-to-side, it allows you to apply the right amount of pressure to ensure a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> My legs feel extra smooth right after I shave and that smoothness lasts longer.</li>
            <li> These 5-blad heads also fit other Gillette handles, and the 3 and 4-blade heads fit this ball handle</li>
            <li> me, the ball part is pretty much a gimmick.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Venus Embrace razors for a long time, and they&#x27;re my favorite razors.</li>
            <li> it comes with one cartilage and it has the ultimate movement for a perfect close shave even in the rough spots such as your Knees and ankles.  </li>
            <li> This is a combination that I am sure to use for a long time.</li>
            <li> The razor heads are already created to swivel to some degree, and most women have gotten so used to using a regular razor that the ball really doesn&#x27;t do a whole lot.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally splurge on razors, but this one is really worth the money.</li>
            <li> I realize that possibly that is how it has always been intended, but I have always been able to get almost two months out of one cartridge of the older models.  </li>
            <li> I easily get nicked every time I use this razor even when I am trying to be super careful.</li>
            <li> This razor gave me a very close shave - my legs are super soft in part due to the amazing moisture strip surrounding the cartridge head.  </li>
            <li> While I really liked the product overall, I was a bit dissapointed in the swirl ball, only because I thought it would move/swirl more than the tiny bit it did,</li>
            <li> I love that I was able to get my most difficult spots, my knees, with no trouble using this razor.</li>
            <li> When she used it for the first time it was so smooth that she thought it wasn&#x27;t actually doing anything, but when she finished her &amp;#34;shaving routine&amp;#34; all the hair was gone.</li>
            <li> Easy to open packaging when your eager to get your shave on!</li>
            <li> I was able to get all the spots I normally miss with a regular razor.</li>
            <li> The grip was also really good, but then again, I don&#x27;t have trouble holding my normal razor either.  </li>
            <li> Especially because I got to try it for FREE thanks to Gillette, I honestly don&#x27;t see myself using any other razor.</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend it.)</li>
            <li> Behind the knees and under the arms were not as easy as I would of liked.  </li>
            <li> The FLEXIBALL, which is the major selling feature for it, though, wasn&#x27;t anything special.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little cooler and more fun to use so the &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was very very impressed with the way I was able to reach all of those hard to reach areas under my arms, knee caps and behind my needs.</li>
            <li> My wife really loves this razor.</li>
            <li> The lubricant on the cartridges works really well.</li>
            <li> She has always used, and really likes, &amp;#34;EOS Vanilla Bliss&amp;#34; shaving cream.</li>
            <li> The price was very competitive on Amazon</li>
            <li> I tried this razor thanks to Venus and bzzagent</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell if the ball has made much of a difference.</li>
            <li> I could just rinse, tap and be ready to go.</li>
            <li> I could just rinse, tap and be ready to go.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t move as much as I thought it would</li>
            <li> thanks to gillette venus</li>
            <li> It left my legs feeling like smooth silk</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t cut myself once and everything felt like a really close shave.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Bzz Agent</li>
            <li> I really like this razor.</li>
            <li> I tried this thanks to bzzagent, I always used venus</li>
            <li> this razor got to try it thanks to Venus and bzzagent for making it all happen.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t think that the underarm shave was very close because halfway through the day, I was developing a five-o&#x27;clock shadow under my arms.</li>
            <li> I really recommend trying this shaver.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor!</li>
            <li> I still highly recommend this razor!</li>
            <li> haha what a gimmick.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor!</li>
            <li> I received this razor as a free promotion and will defiantly purchase in the future to continue use.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t really see what it had to offer.</li>
            <li> It makes it so much easier to shave with it...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that the blade doesn&#x27;t need changed very often (been using 3 weeks and still a very close shave and not clogged with hair.)  </li>
            <li> Thanks to Buzzagent</li>
            <li> The ball really did help with the bikini area.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice all that much use of the ball on my legs though.</li>
            <li> Overall, I did enjoy this razor.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t really add any benefit to my shave.</li>
            <li> It really helps to decrease razor burn.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Venus Swirl and Bzzagent, I got to try out this razor.</li>
            <li> So the ball really does nothing for me at all.  </li>
            <li> I really like this razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m left smooth and silky after each shave.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Gillette and BzzAgent</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this razor because it has already exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> Recently I received this razor to try for free from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> But, I don&#x27;t the swirling ball part makes much of a difference.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I&#x27;d opt for the cheaper option - because this really doesn&#x27;t seem to have any functional improvement.</li>
            <li> It was a very close shave.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Gillette and BzzAgent</li>
            <li> I like the razor design and the shave is also really close.</li>
            <li> But the Venus Swirl absolutely has earned a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect there to be much difference...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor!</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t really.  </li>
            <li> I received this as a test product thanks to Venus</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> then that I really like this razor.</li>
            <li> and because you really don&#x27;t need to use soap or shave gel with it because it has it built in.  </li>
            <li> I went a whole month without shaving.</li>
            <li> I got a very close shave.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel like I knicked myself at all, and it was very painless.</li>
            <li> I really like it and it works well</li>
            <li> Not only does it leave my skin feeling so smooth</li>
            <li> This razor had a very chic look about it.</li>
            <li> Thanks Venus.</li>
            <li> and I was surprised im not afraid to shave my knees anymore</li>
            <li> heads cost a bit more, but I look for coupons and sales, and the heads do last considerably longer than the triple-blade versions, so cost per head sort of works out in the wash...</li>
            <li> This works just the same as every other Venus razor I&#x27;ve tried; which is very good, just nothing different.  </li>
            <li> Due to, I like how this razor is able to move, in different directions, and glides so smoothly.</li>
            <li> It works really well and Is better than other shavers.</li>
            <li> I really love this razor compared to the other Venus&#x27; I am used to using.  </li>
            <li> Is it better than any other 5 blade women&#x27;s razor?</li>
            <li> It also moves a lot more fluently due to the flexi ball.</li>
            <li> The moisture strip on it also doesnt get slimy lke other razors which  I LOVE.</li>
            <li> Other than that I like this razor and would recommend it to others :)</li>
            <li> It could be because I&#x27;m so used to having a routine to making sure I get the curves of my legs, such as with the knee and ankle, as no other razor has the swirl.</li>
            <li> The Venus Swirl with Flexiball worked to remove more hair the any other razor I have even used.</li>
            <li> The razor leaves my skin silky smooth with no irritation and also no major nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying this razor, it&#x27;s different than others and def worth trying</li>
            <li> As a working mom of two in the cooler months, taking the time needed to properly shave my legs is saved for special occasions that require me in a dress like funerals or holidays.</li>
            <li> It just glides around nicely, with very little effort on her part.</li>
            <li> so naturally I bought the womens version for my wife as soon as I was aware of this.</li>
            <li> Honestly the small amount of pivot at the ball probably makes no difference at all</li>
            <li> Not as cool as the commercial say.</li>
            <li> Many times, they would bleed so much that I would have to put on a larger bandage by the time I walked back upstairs.</li>
            <li> This Venus Swirl has 5 blades similar to my current razor, Schick Quadro, so I feel that is a good comparison - similar in the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li> one dislike: That purple part around the razor will sort of leak/rub off onto your counter top or in the shower when you set it down.</li>
            <li> The MoistureGlide is nice and left my skin feeling soft, but the effects are short lived and because of the high price tag on the item, I can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Mama found her new razor!</li>
            <li> I received the new Venus Swirl from BzzAgent!</li>
            <li> The razor itself is great (and I don&#x27;t think the razor for the venus swirl is any different than the one for the regular venus embrace other than the fact that it&#x27;s purple).</li>
            <li> I also really like the new shave gel that was released with the razor.</li>
            <li> and I can just buy new cartridges when I need one which is very convenient.</li>
            <li> They cost way too much to buy a new one every week.  </li>
            <li> The 5-blade heads really make quick work of stubble in a single pass, and you can usually go an extra day between shaves (as compared to twin or triple-head razors (even the original Venus).  </li>
            <li> , I am buying one of the older models....and will be looking into saving up for the Braun epilator soon</li>
            <li> , I am buying one of the older models....and will be looking into saving up for the Braun epilator soon</li>
            <li> The b&#x27;s just grow back so quickly.</li>
            <li> Love this razor- gets closer than any others I&#x27;ve tried on my underarms, which is a big deal for me, especially now that the weather is nicer and sleeveless is the way to go.</li>
            <li> There are 2 main downsides that I find in this razor.</li>
            <li> A main benefit of the Venus blade design is to shave shin-bone and ankle areas without taking a skin sample.</li>
            <li> I went in to this product with high hopes.</li>
            <li> However, the price of the replaceable blades is a bit too high, and is something that needs to be factored in.</li>
            <li> All in all, as a person who uses cartridge razors, I did like this one and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different razors that didn&#x27;t live up to their claims but this one actually gave me a close shave, even around my knees.</li>
            <li> Love love love, I usually use Gillette fusion, as a woman I have really coarse thick hair.</li>
            <li> Because it is positioned on a ball, it is very easy to get to places on my legs that I am normally not able to.</li>
            <li> I mean we shave more than they do!</li>
            <li> that does not mean my opinion is swayed at</li>
            <li> This is not to mention the &amp;#34;pits.&amp;#34; I also used this on my arm-pits and I did not have to go back and reshave my armpits after shaving the first times!</li>
            <li> It gives a smooth shave and doesn&#x27;t feel rough at all.</li>
            <li> And me already having sensitive skin, shaving cream isn&#x27;t much of an option for me.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised at how much a difference</li>
            <li> (but I actually ended up spending more in the long run).</li>
            <li> I am normally a bic soleil user.  </li>
            <li> I normally get razor burn in my bikini area with this razor</li>
            <li> I normally use men&#x27;s disposable razors.</li>
            <li> Normally shaving my armpits is a task</li>
            <li> It last a long time as long as you take good care of it</li>
            <li> I have, however, noticed body-stubble showing up after a few hours, but I think that&#x27;s more my body than the razor.</li>
            <li> And this was able to do it a few times before being demoted to arm pit razor.</li>
            <li> like I normally would.</li>
            <li> perhaps after a few more uses I will adjust to its movement better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shave lasted for days longer than my normal razor.</li>
            <li> but I decided to buy it instead of my normal $8 3 pack of disposables.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have known that the company offers 2x your money back if you aren&#x27;t satisfied because I definitely would have saved the receipt and box.</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;m glad I bought this at Walmart instead of Amazon, because the price on Amazon is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> It provided a very smooth shave and missed very little, if any hair.</li>
            <li> but I never seem to notice a huge difference that would make me HAVE to have this one over any of other Venus razors.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to see the roller ball, but it didn&#x27;t function in the way I expected.</li>
            <li> I am making this my new razor.  </li>
            <li> I will never again pinch pennies when it comes to razors, Gillette Venus is my new go to.</li>
            <li> the new  flexiball makes all the difference while shaving makes the curves and reach all the hair without burn razor marks and cuts  </li>
            <li> After 4-5 shaves, I was thinking that I needed a new razor.</li>
            <li> and I have tried each new one that comes out.</li>
            <li> But what&#x27;s new here?</li>
            <li> I have had an on again, off again relationship with Venus razors and feel as though they have redeemed themselves with this new razor.</li>
            <li> Yeah, knicking myself was a pain, but I figured it was just something I had to live with.</li>
            <li> Once I tried this razor, my skin was never cut and never irritated and it provided a super close shave that I have not experience in a long time!  </li>
            <li> And for all those women that always on the go wether you are a mom or business women always working long hours, no worries at all because you don&#x27;t have to change the razor head for whole MONTH!!</li>
            <li> I normally also have issues with missing places on my knees but this razor has made it SO easy to get all of the areas on my knees.</li>
            <li> I love the blade as usual.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sharper than most women&#x27;s razors I&#x27;ve used in the past</li>
            <li> I rarely have any complaints about razors as long as it does the job...</li>
            <li> No more cheap throwaway razors for me!</li>
            <li> I was really surprised!  </li>
            <li> Aside from the 5 blades, the other part that I love about this razor is the color and overall design.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is while the moisture strips were one of the best I have seen on a razor I am still not a huge fan of them.</li>
            <li> In addition, the MoistureGlide Serum left my skin feeling a whole new level of silky smooth-without using any shaving cream!  </li>
            <li> Works the same as other razors, good razor but not much flexibility</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a new razor for the shower, give this one a try, and I think you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised...</li>
            <li> and it has a long smooth lasting shave and even a lather or like a coating around the blades</li>
            <li> nothing special about that other than  making it not do what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li> It effortlessly reaches tough to shave bikini areas, and everything is super smooth.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this razor - and it&#x27;s much less expensive than Intuition, which is even BETTER!</li>
            <li> To begin, I found the package it came in easy to open even with wet hands.</li>
            <li> I received this razor as part of a promotion and was skeptical of how well it would do, as I have been a loyal customer of another razor for many years.</li>
            <li> The tab in the back made it super convenient to actually USE the product you just purchased - what a thought!</li>
            <li> She liked it and it replaced it previous razor brand which was a tad more expensive.</li>
            <li> I think if the blades were a little sharper it would have made a HUGE difference in the shave.</li>
            <li> The handle is also less slippery than the Body handle or Original Venus handle.  </li>
            <li> Just wish the ball had a little more movement than it does currently!</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING, it not only gets all the hard to get places</li>
            <li> Instead, I found myself using the jet setting on the shower head and even using my thumb at times after each pass to try and clear the blade area and</li>
            <li> Instead, I found myself using the jet setting on the shower head and even using my thumb at times after each pass to try and clear the blade area and</li>
            <li> , I feel the razor should last me longer than a few times and give me just the same amazing shave.  </li>
            <li> One thing that I didn’t really like is that after the shave, although my skin did feel smooth, there was still some red stubble, which went away after a few hours.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how well it shaved my legs.</li>
            <li> I can ditch my old razors.  </li>
            <li> but it makes your skin so soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> I used to only buy disposables because they were much cheaper</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I image a professional brainstorming session with someone suggesting something along the lines of &amp;#34;Let&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I feel the real star of this razor is the freakishly big razor head.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your  money.</li>
            <li> This ball thing on the razor is a complete joke.</li>
            <li> Overall I got a very close shave with no cuts or razor burns even underarms.  </li>
            <li> I continued to have to shave my legs everyday in order to stay smooth.</li>
            <li> The blades did not hurt the skin at all and instead left my skin feeling soft and smooth, plus the flexiball helped in shaving the harder to shave areas, like under the armpit, bikini line, and around the elbows and knees.</li>
            <li> The ball in the handle allows smooth gliding even over trouble areas.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t move much but it&#x27;s enough that I haven&#x27;t knicked myself on my knees or heel.</li>
            <li> burn 9 out of 10 razors give me, but with the Venus Swirl that is far from the case.</li>
            <li> but if you have sensitive skin I would probably not purchase.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find this was not the case.</li>
            <li> No knicks, no razor burn, and so far no ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used on my legs twice so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mom of an 8 month old</li>
            <li> It shaves so close and leaves my skin feeling so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> the only problem I have is it sometimes moves too much.  </li>
            <li> I recently got this in the mail thanks to BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> This razor produced so a soft, close shave.</li>
            <li> This razor really helped eliminate cuts while shaving, especially on my knees, because of the way it moves!</li>
            <li> My old razor had a rubber type grip over and under the razor.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this razor that I received through Gillette and a bzzagent campaign.</li>
            <li> However, contrary to what I believed the flexiball does not rotate at a 360 degree angle, and instead only moves from right to left.</li>
            <li> the ball only rotates right or left (like opening a door knob).</li>
            <li> The razor only moves left or right around the ball</li>
            <li> (my trick is to wash my razor&#x27;s after each use with hot water and an antibacterial soap, let dry completely and keep in a drawer).  </li>
            <li> The only problem I, personally, have with it is that if you have sensitive skin (such as myself), you pretty much HAVE to use shaving gel.</li>
            <li> It was super smooth &amp; I was able to get to all the tight spots and didn&#x27;t have to worry at all about cutting myself.</li>
            <li> The 5 blades get every single hair, the flexiball makes shaving around your ankles, by your knees and under your arms so much easier!</li>
            <li> I used to use a different razor, Schick Intuition, for quite a while, probably somewhere around 6 or 7 years, but this razor proved to me why it should be my new razor!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this razor it seriously leaves my skin</li>
            <li> The more I use the razor the more I don&#x27;t like it. :(</li>
            <li> Previously, I was loyal to the Venus Embrace razor.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it to any woman, especially those who need a closer shave around the knee and ankle.  </li>
            <li> At nearly $28/box of 6 (on Amazon), the cartridges are some of the most expensive on the market and, from what I can tell, do not warrant that very high price tag.</li>
            <li> Most razors I&#x27;ve used become slimy after only a few shaves, but the Moisture Glide serum on this actually hasn&#x27;t yet.</li>
            <li> best razor I&#x27;ve ever used, just wish it were less expensive!</li>
            <li> If I needed to buy a new razor and this and the Venus Embrace were the same price I might grab this again just for the comfier handle and prettier look.</li>
            <li> I usually tend to buy the cheap dollar general razors and often come out of the shower with razor burns.</li>
            <li> I also like that the blades last pretty long.</li>
            <li> My only issue was that although I loved the close shave of the Venus Embrace razor, sometimes I would angle the razor incorrectly, press a little too hard, shave a little too quickly, and end up digging a chunk of my skin off of my body.</li>
            <li> style marketing made a sucker out of me, but really the price is low enough that buying one just to have was justified.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like a ball forcing the head side-to-side, but I&#x27;m amazed at the control you have with this razor, even over tough spots (like ankles and knees), as well as more &amp;#34;delicate&amp;#34; areas.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It took a little getting used to how much it moves around, especially with how slippery it was, and with how much I rush in the shower.  </li>
            <li> it is pretty average.</li>
            <li> I find that I hold my razor near the head anyway, above the ball, to get a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> It only works when your skin is in water, like directly under a shower stream or in a bath.  </li>
            <li> No matter how much shave cream I used or how careful I tried to be, I always ended up with knicks on both my legs.</li>
            <li> I never really paid much attention to non-disposable razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far though, so</li>
            <li> I &amp;#34;borrowed&amp;#34; my husband&#x27;s &amp;#34;man-razors&amp;#34; which is apparently frowned upon.  </li>
            <li> It removed all the hair and left no bumps as I&#x27;m really sensitive there.</li>
            <li> I will be buying refill blades in the near future.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair which can sometimes be difficult for shaving because it bends so close to the skin that razors go right over the top without cutting the hair.</li>
            <li> Later, I found the Venus Snap travel size handle and was pretty excited because I was less likely to snap the little handle.</li>
            <li> Super close shave and the blade can actually be reused quit a few times.</li>
            <li> Just because it doesn&#x27;t cut me doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m going to let it pass on giving me a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I first received this product, I was excited and a bit skeptical.</li>
            <li> The cheap, soft plastic material just wasn&#x27;t very durable for the few times you accidentally press too hard.</li>
            <li> The blades last super long like other Venus blades.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see a difference in it than the other razors.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t really notice a difference in this razor and my other Venus embrace razor.</li>
            <li> so you can get a clean shave those hard to shave areas like your knees.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but it already is my favorite razor, hands down.</li>
            <li> So, overall, I am pleased with this razor but it is equal to other Venus razors; no huge breakthrough here.</li>
            <li> and I love this razor because the lotion strips on the blade and the flexible structure make it so easy to shave without cutting yourself or missing any hair.</li>
            <li> However, the handle only moves right to left instead of up and down</li>
            <li> Shaving your knees and lower leg can be a little tricky but the ball helps so much !</li>
            <li> Only complaint I have is I don&#x27;t think the blades last as long as most.</li>
            <li> At first I had a regular razor handle, but all of those snapped in half.</li>
            <li> The shave is alright, no better really though than my old Schick Hydro-silk.</li>
            <li> I have been using my old razor for so long and was definitely in need of a change.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel itchy and dry after shaving - I feel it is definitely not for people with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> All of the hype over the little flex ball thing is really for nothing.</li>
            <li> I normally am not impressed with razors other than the one I normally use, HOWEVER, this one gives a fantastically close shave and leaves your legs looking and feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The packaging is easy to open -  no struggling with sharp, hard plastic.</li>
            <li> It clogged rather fast where my plain Jane razor</li>
            <li> It clogged rather fast where my plain Jane razor</li>
            <li> The razor isn&#x27;t &#x27;stiff&#x27; like usual razors and can &#x27;swerve&#x27; easily at bends in your body, such as your knees, which makes it a lot easier to shave them.</li>
            <li> My favorite feature is the ball joint because it glided over my awful knees without nicking them, something that has been pretty much unachievable since I started shaving.</li>
            <li> (a problem I have had with disposable razors) due to the MoistureGlide serum and the soft pads that surround the blades.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to seeing hwo my second experience goes with this razor, and am especially looking forward to seeing how long this razor will last me.</li>
            <li> However, if you want to try a new razor and have a few extra bucks to spend why not give this razor a try?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I like it so much</li>
            <li> Usually, I use men&#x27;s razors because I get really close shaves.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually review for products, but I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a month, and I really do think it&#x27;s great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my leg hair isn’t even long enough to braid.</li>
            <li> my leg hair isn’t even long enough to braid.</li>
            <li> The razor head moves up &amp; down, which makes going over knees &amp; ankles easier, &amp; the Flexiball moves from side to side, allowing movement over the natural curve of your leg.</li>
            <li> The size of it was a little intimidating because my old razor was tiny!</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and typically don&#x27;t shave because I always get razor burns.</li>
            <li> So much less clunky to hold than my old razor.</li>
            <li> I am so dissapointed that I spent $12 on a razor that is worse than a cheap 24pack of razors you can buy for $5.</li>
            <li> so it only allows a limited range of additional movement that I don&#x27;t think makes a difference when shaving.</li>
            <li> I find that usually I have trouble using most razors because of my sensitive skin and the ridiculous amount of razor</li>
            <li> I suppose it allows me to shave without pressing down so hard against my skin, but the flexibility benefits end there, as I knicked myself on the very first shave.</li>
            <li> although it had the unique Flexiball, I was skeptical about whether it would actually make a noticeable difference or not.</li>
            <li> only moves a little left and right, squeaking occasionally which I find annoying and cheap.</li>
            <li> It really gets the hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> Venus Swirl provided a very close shave all over including hard to shave areas like knees.</li>
            <li> This razor did leave my skin moisturized and not dry like other razors do.</li>
            <li> It gave me the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve had in a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lasted me a really long time</li>
            <li> I have long been a fan of the Venus brand, switching to another brand sometimes when its on sale</li>
            <li> I have been using my husbands razor for so long</li>
            <li> What a complete waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Another issue I had was that the hair came back after 3 days, which was to be expected since it’s a razor</li>
            <li> ...the shave is not nearly as close as it should be.</li>
            <li> It lasted long, and gave me the closest shave on my legs that I&#x27;ve ever gotten.</li>
            <li> If you are someone who actually uses the handle, then maybe it will be helpful, although I would think it would make it harder to get a close</li>
            <li> It will not work if you turn your back on the shower and just use it on a wet leg.  </li>
            <li> But now I wonder why I did that for so long.</li>
            <li> but I was curious enough to give</li>
            <li> I have been using my disposable razors for so long</li>
            <li> The matching blades are not really the type I personally care for.  </li>
            <li> underarms, I used the normal body wash soap I usually use, but I felt like everything was too slippery</li>
            <li> I have been using a Venus 3 blade razor for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> I had never really considerd trying a 5 blade razor simply because I thought my razor was doing the job it was meant to do.</li>
            <li> , I left it sitting on the wet sink and it got all gooey.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The cartridges have a thick lotion bar on it, but I just don&#x27;t get the whole lotion bar thing.  </li>
            <li> The lotion bar seems so thick that it didn&#x27;t really seem to shave as closely as it needed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my inner thighs are hard to shave (they are curvy and very sensitive).</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I found the larger head and stubble comb to be a hassle for oft-missed, longer leg hairs.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I found the larger head and stubble comb to be a hassle for oft-missed, longer leg hairs.</li>
            <li> The other downside to the razor is by the 3rd time using it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had such a close shave with any other razor.</li>
            <li> this is just a regular razor just like all the other venus ones.</li>
            <li> However, after my shower I noticed that my legs still were not completely shaven!  </li>
            <li> It has a swivel to it which makes it easy to reach the hard to get to places such as behind the knees and bikini area.</li>
            <li> it hangs upright to dry (or lays blade-up on the shelf) after</li>
            <li> stays relatively dry.  </li>
            <li> The moisture strip is a bonus as I have dry skin and now my legs feel hydrated and not itchy.</li>
            <li> My main complaint is the outer rim was not needed.</li>
            <li> I was using a different brand but was getting annoyed by the closeness of the shave, and my skin was very irritated.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take long, only a couple of weeks, for the lotion bar to wear down.  </li>
            <li> I somehow managed not to miss a single hair on my knees, ankles and armpits.</li>
            <li> Usually, I use men&#x27;s razors because I get really close shaves and the razor heads typically glide over my ankles, knees and underarms with ease.</li>
            <li> Usually, I use men&#x27;s razors because I get really close shaves and the razor heads typically glide over my ankles, knees and underarms with ease.  </li>
            <li> It shaves but it&#x27;s not worth the extra money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> In the meantime, my regular routine consist of me blindly brandishing my basic &amp;#34;Plain Jane&amp;#34; razor trying to knock out as much shaving as I can in</li>
            <li> My legs were also so soft after shaving and the shave lasted longer than usual for me.</li>
            <li> Normally I do not shave my legs during the winter since I have no,reason to.</li>
            <li> It seems really loose and makes me slip all the time.</li>
            <li> The brand new blades were dull, I had to shave twice over and even that did not remove all the hair.</li>
            <li> This motion is balanced out by the blade head which moves only up and down.</li>
            <li> little background, I am pretty hairy and have thick armpit and leg hairs.</li>
            <li> I also found the occasional squeaking of the cheap shiny plastic ball annoying enough to retire this razor to back of the bottom drawer of my bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> I also found the occasional squeaking of the cheap shiny plastic ball annoying enough to retire this razor to back of the bottom drawer of my bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> The handle is slightly too big, but I&#x27;m getting used to it.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t find it much different then previous Venus razors I had used.  </li>
            <li> It is bigger than the razor I was using previously, but it didn&#x27;t bother me in any way while using it.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and usually get cut up pretty badly during shaving but for the first time in years I left the shower with no cuts!</li>
            <li> I also liked that I could quickly shave over my knees and other tough areas without having to slow down for fear of cutting my skin.</li>
            <li> I also liked that I could quickly shave over my knees and other tough areas without having to slow down for fear of cutting my skin.</li>
            <li> I know this is silly, but the razor is pretty!  </li>
            <li> So far the razor and refills are well worth the increased price despite wishing that they were slightly less expensive!</li>
            <li> It feels like it&#x27;s made of cheapter plastic, so it tends to get a bit slippery when it&#x27;s wet and soapy.</li>
            <li> These things have no real weight in them.</li>
            <li> You have to be extremely careful from nipping yourself.</li>
            <li> : It feels like you are getting a close shave, but after a few hours you can already feel hair growing back.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the packaging but everything else came as expected.</li>
            <li> The razor blades even have a moisture strip that on them to prevent any rough sliding</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t feel as rough around my ankles and knees.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not normally very picky when it comes to razors.</li>
            <li> This one only has grip on the underside of the razor and for that reason I have had it slip out of my hands a few times.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually get any cuts and the cartridges usually last me a long time!</li>
            <li> Each time, I had one tiny, little knick that stopped bleeding by the time I finished my other leg.</li>
            <li> The grip on the handle is far inferior to the other Gilette Venus model I had, and the swirly ball just makes it hard to control the razor.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried because the head seems awkwardly flat</li>
            <li> This was certainly not the case.</li>
            <li> The ball on this razor helps get in those tough to reach places that a normal razor would not get to.</li>
            <li> But I will soak them in baby oil to make them sharp again.</li>
            <li> It also did not nick my kneecaps or other bumps on my leg.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what the big deal is with the swirl head?</li>
            <li> I thought that the moistureglide serum doesn&#x27;t last past 2/3 shaves and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always nicking my knees when I shave with other razors, but not the Venus Swirl razor.  </li>
            <li> In fact I have used Venus for years and this seemed like the other but with added chrome.</li>
            <li> and I do like it, but other than the flexiball</li>
            <li> Now due to it being the end of winter</li>
            <li> is to change the MoistureGlide formula so that it doesn&#x27;t stick to other things in the shower</li>
            <li> My other razors just don&#x27;t compare to venus.</li>
            <li> That makes it so much harder to shave!</li>
            <li> After using this razor for a couple weeks, I&#x27;m not really sure the roller ball is necessary.</li>
            <li> Due to that flaw it slides all over the place when you shave your legs</li>
            <li> It also glides across your body, none of that &#x27;pull&#x27; or &#x27;scrape&#x27; from other razors, while still taking the hair with it.</li>
            <li> The swiveling ball makes for a wide range of coverage and you&#x27;ll never miss a spot!</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s enough of a reason to buy it.</li>
            <li> I have to shave my underarms about every other day.</li>
            <li> After I finish using the two razor heads that came with it, I plan on switching to one of the other varieties.  </li>
            <li> It did stay decently sharp.</li>
            <li> So when it does, it needs a sharp razor to get through my leg hairs.</li>
            <li> It worked extremely well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not slimy like some other  razors tend to feel, either.</li>
            <li> Other</li>
            <li> Again I have used other razors and never had this problem.</li>
            <li> And it only helps that I will no longer need to shave my legs every day because every time I get a cut psoriasis usually follows.</li>
            <li> Even so, the bulk of the razor head is some sort of water active lubrication pad which to me, is a tad overkill.</li>
            <li> I have used men&#x27;s razors for the past 5+ years after using some really poorly designed women&#x27;s razors but this razor has really changed that!</li>
            <li> TYpically I have to shave my legs every other day</li>
            <li> The only downside is that after shaving my underarms and legs, the blades were somewhat dull.</li>
            <li> I think because the head of the razor is so large due to the gel pad things, the &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34;, etc, all the little gadgets, it makes it too difficult for me to get</li>
            <li> The blade quality itself is average.</li>
            <li> (I received this to try along with the not impressive shaving gel thanks to Venus and BzzAgent)</li>
            <li> The handle allows for a firm grip without slipping.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made with a harder plastic that feels less like dried</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to press down at all</li>
            <li> I will break down the pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I mean this razor&#x27;s cartridge head could cast a shadow in comparison to my husband multiple blade man razors.</li>
            <li> EXTREMELY SHARP, CLOSE shave!</li>
            <li> I have been an extremely dedicated user of the Schick Intuition razor for 10 YEARS!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have dark, coarse, fast-growing hair that needs a daily shave.  </li>
            <li> If using this razor means I get to shave less</li>
            <li> it gets a slight sticky feeling to it.  </li>
            <li> Previously I felt like I would always miss some hair or it would still be visible somehow.</li>
            <li> I thought that, as advertised, I would have to shave less.</li>
            <li> Let me start of by saying I typically  use mens razors.</li>
            <li> I typically stick to men&#x27;s razors because I&#x27;m 5&#x27;10&amp;#34; and have a lot of leg to cover.  </li>
            <li> Women&#x27;s razors typically just don&#x27;t &amp;#34;cut it&amp;#34; for me.  </li>
            <li> In my mind, it would function like a Dyson vacuum commercial, rolling about in all kinds of expensively graceful directions.  </li>
            <li> My legs are now smooth and silky and my husband doesn&#x27;t give me dirty looks any longer because I&#x27;ve used his razor!</li>
            <li> It has 5 blades plus the little &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; at the end, which helps you get the random hairs that rebel against the normal direction of hair growth.</li>
            <li> and it does not pull hair or scrape your skin like other razors I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> this little razor had a lot of work to do and it did</li>
            <li> This product is not worth the splurge!</li>
            <li> It has&lt;br /&gt;Water-activated MoistureGlide Serum that surrounds the blades, which was a little too slimey feeling on my skin, but it allows for easier glide.</li>
            <li> THe moisture strip doesn&#x27;t become slimy as other women&#x27;s razors usually do</li>
            <li> I just wish it lasted a little longer...</li>
            <li> There is a little bit of movement because of the ball, but nothing that in my opinion enhances its ability to shave.</li>
            <li> and it does not pull hair or scrape your skin like other razors I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> Now, about that little silver ball meant to increase the razors ability to bend...</li>
            <li> the little ledge I store it on</li>
            <li> Not one little cut.</li>
            <li> THe moisture strip doesn&#x27;t become slimy as other women&#x27;s razors usually do</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a month now</li>
            <li> When that happens, this particular model seems to become very harsh and uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> it made it easier to shave weird spots and made my legs really soft.</li>
            <li> With this razor, I was shaving my underarms everyday.</li>
            <li> Please dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> You have to go over the curves a few time to get all the hair off.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t waste them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I think it dried out after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Venus brand for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> These particular ones seem to be made to purposely feel uncomfortable so that you are almost forced to replace your cartridge.  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m not going to waste time trying to shave my legs with it anymore, I&#x27;ll stick with my little disposable razor!</li>
            <li> Usually I don&#x27;t go for this brand because as a broke college student it&#x27;s a little pricey, but after trying it</li>
            <li> There is no more bending in awkward places or nearly falling down when trying to get that one hair that you can not reach.</li>
            <li> I went out to buy this right away, but was disappointed.</li>
            <li> This can be a little hard in the shower of course.  </li>
            <li> Usually I replace them because they get dirty under the soft plastic/rubbery parts</li>
            <li> In the past I tried to stay away from razor with moisture strips because they become slimy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a lazy shaver (I&#x27;ve been known to give up after 1 leg), but today I shaved EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the swivel.</li>
            <li> I usually use whatever razor is on sale</li>
            <li> I usually use the men&#x27;s razors because the give a closer shave but not anymore.</li>
            <li> so not many complaints.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try it on a whim because I&#x27;ve used Venus products in the past.</li>
            <li> This was the case for my underarms as well, which can usually go two days.</li>
            <li> comments have been harsh about the lube-strips &amp;#34;melting&amp;#34; on the heads, but honestly, I&#x27;ve not seen this issue, but I also don&#x27;t leave the razor face-down in a puddle after use...</li>
            <li> I never felt like it was going to slip out of my hand, which is a problem I sometimes encounter with my usual disposal razors.</li>
            <li> I was always cutting myself with the old style razors.</li>
            <li> women razors usually dont have 5</li>
            <li> I am used to using mens razors, or a lot of womens at one time, because the usual womens razor doesnt get the job done.</li>
            <li> It rotates to the harder places, like behind the knee, it helped my skin become smother.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been unable to use standard ladies razors, they just didn&#x27;t work on my stubborn leg hair.  </li>
            <li> I dont have to shave my legs everyday!</li>
            <li> I sometimes still get random scratches from pressing too hard or pulling my skin too tight, but I can deal with scratches so long as I am not bleeding bullets for blood from shaving.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing to point out is that because this razor is so huge/wide, its almost near impossible to shave your bikini line</li>
            <li> It glided over the hard to reach spots around my ankle and knee cap.</li>
            <li> Hardly ever get a knick.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;swivel&amp;#34; part at the head hardly moves at all.</li>
            <li> The flex ball allows the razor to swivel in to hard to reach places.  </li>
            <li> but I am just having a hard time getting use to it moving on me.  </li>
            <li> and gets into all those hard to reach spots.</li>
            <li> The razor head is not a nice as the venus embrace and after 2 weeks it was dull and rusting and that was with me not leaving it in the shower.</li>
            <li> and I was nervous that I would have problems with getting to areas on my legs due to my knee being weak, but with this razor I haven&#x27;t had any problems!</li>
            <li> Another disappointment with the larger razor head design, in my opinion, was the bikini area-</li>
            <li> Another disappointment with the larger razor head design, in my opinion, was the bikini area-</li>
            <li> so it doesn’t pluck hair from the roots, but I would have preferred that the effects lasted for at least a week.</li>
            <li> My one complaint is the handle.</li>
            <li> The flexible handle shaved around my knees without cutting them, and I was left with the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had!  </li>
            <li> I hope!are almost forced to replace your cartridge.  </li>
            <li> She has some thick hair so that means a lot.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s thick and has a gel-like feeling) -  </li>
            <li> No more cuts on my ankles!</li>
            <li> The closeness of the shave was unbelievable!</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t mean it takes any of the power away from the shaving expeeience</li>
            <li> I received this razor as a promotion from Venus and was anxious to try it out!</li>
            <li> (although I&#x27;m looking seriously into an epilator).  </li>
            <li> I bought this one to replace one that had broken (dropped on the shower floor).</li>
            <li> There is nothing worse than a cut from a razor</li>
            <li> If you do that, you will need a thin layer of something like soap or shave gel.  </li>
            <li> so I can put this shaving junk behind me soon...</li>
            <li> so I can put this shaving junk behind me soon...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping the blades don&#x27;t turn to crap in the next couple of weeks</li>
            <li> the power behind the razor and how it made my legs feel in combination with the Venus Swirl with touch of Olay Shave Gel.</li>
            <li> The head contains some serious moisturizers and didnt irritate my skin at all!</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst razor I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I feel the idea to &amp;#34;reinvent the wheel&amp;#34;  for a razor was a bust.</li>
            <li> I must say I am not impressed with the “FlexiBall”.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this mirror coated plastic ball</li>
            <li> Although, despite the razor’s flexibility it was difficult to shave under the knee areas.</li>
            <li> but I was extremely skeptical about the handle.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> Totally not impressed when companies do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Totally not impressed when companies do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I no longer accidentally dig chunks of skin from my legs because the rollerball is responsive to the curve of your leg/body, and prevents me from holding the razor at the wrong direction.</li>
            <li> Whenever I shave I almost always miss hairs, because I&#x27;m unable to reach tricky areas with my razor.</li>
            <li> The worst spots were on the back of my calves and around my ankle.</li>
            <li> I was intrigued, yet skeptical about the idea.</li>
            <li> Before getting in the shower, I was skeptical of its range of movement but as soon as I started using it, it was all sorts of moving around everywhere.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not totally impressed.</li>
            <li> I also usually hate razors with moisture strips because they get gooey and usually don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> So this helps avoid unnecessary, painful nicks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a razor that cut so close without cutting or causing razor burn.</li>
            <li> I was so mad</li>
            <li> the shave itself isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would be bad</li>
            <li> I am also extremely disappointed in how short-lives the razor was.</li>
            <li> so the blade can move around with out cutting us!</li>
            <li> I absolutely HATE shaving my legs.</li>
            <li> Almost impossible!!</li>
            <li> Horrible product.</li>
            <li> My sister loves this thing, but the refills are outrageous.</li>
            <li> Worst purchase ever, the swirl is nothing but just a catchy fad to a consumer.</li>
            <li> This handle is the worst!</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t leave any nasty marks, it just hurts.</li>

            <li> I am not a fan of these razors. I can&#x27;t get a close shave with them</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great razor. Love the 5 blades instead of the 4 I&#x27;m used to. It drags very smooth and I can barely feel it across my skin.&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have (with majority of Venus razors) is that the purple material around the razor blades can &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; if you leave it sitting in water. My advice is to flip it up after you use it so the blades are facing up.</li>
            <li> My wife really loves this razor. Before this she used a &amp;#34;Gillette Mach-3 Turbo&amp;#34;, which she liked, but she thinks the &amp;#34;Venus Swirl&amp;#34; is better. It can swivel in all directions, so she doesn&#x27;t have to work to get it to do a good job. It just glides around nicely, with very little effort on her part. When she used it for the first time it was so smooth that she thought it wasn&#x27;t actually doing anything, but when she finished her &amp;#34;shaving routine&amp;#34; all the hair was gone. The razor didn&#x27;t get clogged, despite having 5 blades. The lubricant on the cartridges works really well. From an aesthetic standpoint, she also likes this razor a lot. It feels good in her hand, and the razor is also very pretty, with the nice purplish color and all the swirls. (Please note that my wife does not use the shaving cream that is made to accompany this razor. She has always used, and really likes, &amp;#34;EOS Vanilla Bliss&amp;#34; shaving cream. It smells good and helps deliver a smooth shave.)</li>
            <li> Love Benus razors. I&#x27;ve had a few and have loved them all. I bought this one to replace one that had broken (dropped on the shower floor). I&#x27;ve never had one break before that. Usually I replace them because they get dirty under the soft plastic/rubbery parts ehete I can&#x27;t get them clean. Best thing about Venus is I never cut myself shaving.</li>
            <li> I really love this razor compared to the other Venus&#x27; I am used to using.  The price was very competitive on Amazon so I chose them to make my purchase.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this. I bought the mens version of this a while ago so naturally I bought the womens version for my wife as soon as I was aware of this. Honestly the small amount of pivot at the ball probably makes no difference at all but it&#x27;s a little cooler and more fun to use so the &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; style marketing made a sucker out of me, but really the price is low enough that buying one just to have was justified.</li>
            <li> This razor is really great and I was lucky enough to be able to try it for free thanks to Gillette. My favorite part was the moisture strip it made it easier to shave weird spots and made my legs really soft. The blades themselves are as sharp as mens which is great for getting a close shave. I even felt that the tiny comb helped to get every hair in one pass of the razor so no razor burn! Will definitely buy refills!</li>
            <li> I got this as a promotion from the brand through buzz feed, and for free.This razor is just as good as any of the Venus razors. Although I really enjoy the added moisturizer and the not so bulky razor head. However, not so sure the ball really adds anything to this.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for free as a sample and it was INDEED the very best razor I have ever used. It was the closest shave I have ever had. The flexiball got every curve on my bony knees without slicing my knees. It was great and I honestly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love the Venus swirl razor i received from BzzAgent.  It&#x27;s wonderful it is easy to use and gives you a close soft shave.  I love the feeling of my skin after i finish shaving.  It feels like i have already put on lotion.  I recommend this product to anyone looking for a new 5 blade razor that is flexiable and will provide an excellent close shave.</li>
            <li> As a mom I love this razor!! great for a quick shave and the head of the razor swivels around my curves !!! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> I received this razor from BzzAgent and Gillette. I was pleasantly surprised at how well it shaved my legs. I have tried many different razors that didn&#x27;t live up to their claims but this one actually gave me a close shave, even around my knees. I will be purchasing these razors for my daughters.</li>
            <li> I received the Venus Swirl razor free from Gillette. I&#x27;m giving it a 4 star review because I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s that much better than what I was using before, the old Gillette Venus. It does have 5 blades compared to 3 in my old one and it glides/handles nicely. The moisture strip all around the head is WAY bigger than what I am used to. I don&#x27;t think it gave a closer shave though, which is what I was hoping for. It is a pretty razor, but I don&#x27;t really care how pretty it is or what color it is. I just want a close shave.</li>
            <li> Great razor!  I received this as a Bzzagent and I&#x27;m impressed at how smooth and soft my skin is after use.  It provided such a close shave I can ditch my old razors.  I am making this my new razor.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product ! Especially because I got to try it for FREE thanks to Gillette, I honestly don&#x27;t see myself using any other razor. I&#x27;ve never had a razor that cut so close without cutting or causing razor burn. Glad to say I&#x27;ve found one :) the only mishap I don&#x27;t like about the razor is I don&#x27;t like the handle.</li>
            <li> I went out to buy this right away, but was disappointed. The grip on the handle is far inferior to the other Gilette Venus model I had, and the swirly ball just makes it hard to control the razor. I regret purchasing it.</li>
            <li> I tried this razor thanks to Venus and bzzagent and I love it!!! In the past I tried to stay away from razor with moisture strips because they become slimy. This one does not. It also glides across my knees and ankles very smoothly. It also keeps my legs smoother longer! I would highly recommend this razor!!!</li>
            <li> I had an opportunity to try the Venus Swirl razor free through BzzAgent.  This razor leaves a silky smooth finish, even in those tricky areas. I didn&#x27;t have to put any pressure on my skin as the razor glides so smoothly.  The handle allows for a firm grip without slipping.  My legs were so smooth after using this razor! I would definitely recommend the product.</li>
            <li> Its ok I cant see a difference.</li>
            <li> Love love love, I usually use Gillette fusion, as a woman I have really coarse thick hair. I was so excited to see the five blade for girls! Thank you Gillette!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing razor, I couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth my skin was. It was even easy to shave my knees :) I highly recommend. The only downside is that after shaving my underarms and legs, the blades were somewhat dull. But I will soak them in baby oil to make them sharp again. Overall, a great razor for an affordable price!</li>
            <li> Nothing special. It&#x27;s a razor. It shaves but it&#x27;s not worth the extra money.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t get a close and smoother shave at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using men&#x27;s razors for the last 10 years or so because I was fed up with the sub-par shave that girly razors were giving me. But I&#x27;m happily sold on this razor now. It gave me the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve had in a long time. I didn&#x27;t have to press down at all and it cut through my neglected leg hair easily. My favorite feature is the ball joint because it glided over my awful knees without nicking them, something that has been pretty much unachievable since I started shaving. I&#x27;m usually a lazy shaver (I&#x27;ve been known to give up after 1 leg), but today I shaved EVERYTHING. I rush my baths during my toddler&#x27;s nap time so I can get everything else on my list done and I am always happy with something that makes that easier to do. Note: I received the razor as a promotion from Venus Gillette</li>
            <li> by far one of the best razors I have ever used. I received my Venus swirl raise or last month and I still haven&#x27;t had to change the cartridge it. It gives you a smooth and silky clean shave. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more cartridges and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use my own throat sore again! I received my product free from bzz agent but free or not it&#x27;s definitely worth what you would pay for it</li>
            <li> I have fallen in love with this razor, I did not buy it off Amazon because I got it free to review but it makes your skin so soft to the touch. No cutting yourself, just beautiful smoothness. I definitely will be buying refill packs before I run out though.</li>
            <li> This razor has changed my life. I used to only buy disposables because they were much cheaper (but I actually ended up spending more in the long run). They contain two blades, no moisturing strip, &amp; no movement in the razor head. This Gillette Venus Swirl with Flexiball has FIVE blades, a moisturizing strip &amp; TWO spots of movement. The razor head moves up &amp; down, which makes going over knees &amp; ankles easier, &amp; the Flexiball moves from side to side, allowing movement over the natural curve of your leg. My legs are super smooth &amp; I don&#x27;t feel like I missed a spot since the razor moved with my body. I will never again pinch pennies when it comes to razors, Gillette Venus is my new go to.</li>
            <li> same flex-ball technology as the men&#x27;s fusion. no cuts/great for curves!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great as far as razors go. The handle is slightly too big, but I&#x27;m getting used to it.</li>
            <li> I received this razor as part of a promotion and was skeptical of how well it would do, as I have been a loyal customer of another razor for many years. I was pleasantly surprised. It provided a very smooth shave and missed very little, if any hair. It also did not nick my kneecaps or other bumps on my leg. I also like how the razor head swiveled around my leg and will be buying this razor in the future.</li>
            <li> I like it! Not sure about the swivel. I can&#x27;t really tell if the ball has made much of a difference. I&#x27;m not sure if I like it so much just because it has 5 blades..  I like the look. Works great. No complaints. Is it better than any other 5 blade women&#x27;s razor? I couldn&#x27;t tell ya, check it out for yourself.</li>
            <li> 4 stars because it works amazingly as any Venus razor I have tried. I love the blade as usual. The handle, however, is nothing special. I don&#x27;t notice any kind of closer or better shave than I normally get with another Venus. All of the hype over the little flex ball thing is really for nothing. Although the handle is pretty! I also really like the new shave gel that was released with the razor.</li>
            <li> Works the same as other razors, good razor but not much flexibility</li>
            <li> I love this product! I received it from Bzzagent to test and review for free and it is a great product! There is nothing worse than a cut from a razor and I love this razor because the lotion strips on the blade and the flexible structure make it so easy to shave without cutting yourself or missing any hair. It&#x27;s lasted me a really long time and I can just buy new cartridges when I need one which is very convenient. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for the perfect razor!</li>
            <li> As a working mom of two in the cooler months, taking the time needed to properly shave my legs is saved for special occasions that require me in a dress like funerals or holidays. In the meantime, my regular routine consist of me blindly brandishing my basic &amp;#34;Plain Jane&amp;#34; razor trying to knock out as much shaving as I can in the before the kids start picking locks on the bathroom door.&lt;br /&gt;  Being a Buzz Agent, I received a Gillette Venus Swirl razor with the bonus Violet Swirl shave gel to review from the Gillette company. I will focus my review on the razor only at this time. To begin, I found the package it came in easy to open even with wet hands. I was quickly drawn to the textured, purple handle and its artsy pattern that is pleasing to look at and efficient for gripping. Unfortunately, I feel the idea to &amp;#34;reinvent the wheel&amp;#34;  for a razor was a bust. I image a professional brainstorming session with someone suggesting something along the lines of &amp;#34;Let&#x27;s add a shiny ball! Yes, a shiny plastic ball with a mirror finish and lets call it something hip like “FlexiBall” &amp;#34;. I must say I am not impressed with the “FlexiBall”. In my mind, it would function like a Dyson vacuum commercial, rolling about in all kinds of expensively graceful directions.  Sadly, this mirror coated plastic ball only moves a little left and right, squeaking occasionally which I find annoying and cheap. I feel the real star of this razor is the freakishly big razor head. I mean this razor&#x27;s cartridge head could cast a shadow in comparison to my husband multiple blade man razors. I suppose my bias on the size comes from using a razor that has only two blades, opposed to the 5 blades on this razor. Even so, the bulk of the razor head is some sort of water active lubrication pad which to me, is a tad overkill. On the plus side, it felt like in 2 swipes I had cleared my arm pits of all offending stubble. I was a fan of the awesome little comb-nubs before the blades making even the shortest of  hair stand up. On the other hand, I found the larger head and stubble comb to be a hassle for oft-missed, longer leg hairs. It clogged rather fast where my plain Jane razor I could just rinse, tap and be ready to go. Instead, I found myself using the jet setting on the shower head and even using my thumb at times after each pass to try and clear the blade area and my leg hair isn’t even long enough to braid. Another disappointment with the larger razor head design, in my opinion, was the bikini area- way too big to do touch ups. I felt that if I were to use this regularly I’d be better off keeping a standard size razor around for that.&lt;br /&gt;  Overall, I will give the razor points for looking artsy and the nice feel of the handle, but for my needs, I found the razor head to be too bulky and it clogged up too fast for my liking. I also found the occasional squeaking of the cheap shiny plastic ball annoying enough to retire this razor to back of the bottom drawer of my bathroom sink. I&#x27;ve rated this 3 stars as I felt it was just &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34;, I will be sticking with my non-shiny standard razors for the convince knowing I can hit all target areas (arms, legs, and bikini) without needing two different razors to get the job done.ven the shortest of  hair stand up.

            <li> I am not sure what the big deal is with the swirl head? I really don&#x27;t see a difference in it than the other razors. It does the job but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it just for that again. It doesn&#x27;t move as much as I thought it would but I love the Venus brand so I thought I would try. I do like the option that I can attach whatever blade I like.</li>
            <li> I received the Venus Swirl Razor Free to try through BzzAgent.com When the package arrived with my Venus Swirl, I was thrilled! I normally use disposable razors but loved the packaging as well as the look and feel of the actual razor. Attaching the blade was done with ease which is something I was always concerned about with razors which is one reason I use disposable.  When trying out this razor it occurred to me quickly that it wasn&#x27;t quite as flexible as advertised, it seemed to do the job very well and with accuracy, but I still would of liked more flexibility. Behind the knees and under the arms were not as easy as I would of liked.  The other downside to the razor is by the 3rd time using it I did not feel as though my shave was quite as nice and quite as close as it was the first two times, I feel the razor should last me longer than a few times and give me just the same amazing shave.  All in all I enjoyed the razor and will purchase refills and continue to use it, its easy to hold and fits nicely in my hand which is a big plus.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> the new  flexiball makes all the difference while shaving makes the curves and reach all the hair without burn razor marks and cuts  so easy to shave and thanks to gillette venus i try this product  for free and discove that i dont have to suffer to have beautiful legs</li>
            <li> Awesome!! I got to try this for free from Bzzagent and I must say it is awesome! I usually use whatever razor is on sale but I think I&#x27;ll be hooked on this one. I&#x27;ve never had such a close shave with any other razor. TYpically I have to shave my legs every other day but I used this Monday and my legs still look hair-free and still feel very smooth. I&#x27;m quite impressed. If using this razor means I get to shave less then I&#x27;ll be buying them forever!!</li>
            <li> Thanks to Venus I got to try this product for free, along with the Venus Violet Swirl Shave Gel. It left my legs feeling like smooth silk and I got the closest shave ever!</li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent and Gillette, I got this sweet puppy in the mail!! I have long been a fan of the Venus brand, switching to another brand sometimes when its on sale but I can tell you I won&#x27;t be doing that anymore! This thing goes over my knee caps like a champ giving me a nice smooth finish. I didn&#x27;t cut myself once and everything felt like a really close shave. Mama found her new razor!</li>
            <li> I give this product four stars because its amazing!! I usually use the men&#x27;s razors because the give a closer shave but not anymore. I definitely will be buying this razor again!!</li>
            <li> Just another razor like all the Venus lines</li>
            <li> Thanks to Bzz Agent I was able to test out this razor, plus the shaving cream for free and it was really nice. I got a smooth shave on my legs and underarms. (:</li>
            <li> Personally I loved this. I have extremely sensitive skin and typically don&#x27;t shave because I always get razor burns. I decided to give this a go as I got it 100% free from Bzzagent.  After shaving I prepared for the razor burn but nope! Nothing. First time in YEARS that I havent gotten a razor burn. I&#x27;m in love with it and it got an incredibly close shave. It also moves a lot more fluently due to the flexi ball. This is an awesome product. The moisture strip on it also doesnt get slimy lke other razors which  I LOVE. This is definitely a product I&#x27;ll use again.</li>
            <li> I really like this razor. It really gets the hard to reach places. It&#x27;s very easy and comfortable to use and gets the job quickly.</li>
            <li> I tried this thanks to bzzagent, I always used venus but this razor is the best. i love the flexi ball, the design of the razor, and the gel. its great.</li>
            <li> I got this Venus razor as a promotion through BzzAgent.  I like the Venus Swirl Razor but I didn&#x27;t find it much different then previous Venus razors I had used.  I thought that the moistureglide serum doesn&#x27;t last past 2/3 shaves and it gets a slight sticky feeling to it.  The contour blades do a good job at getting stubble, and getting a close clean shave.  All in all I&#x27;ve always been happy with Venus razors so not many complaints.  I don&#x27;t usually get any cuts and the cartridges usually last me a long time! Bravo to another good product Venus!</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of the product thanks to Gilette and BzzAgent, and I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now. I&#x27;m in love already. The shave is just as good on day 14 as it was on day 1. Very close shave, and the flexi-ball makes it easy to shave tricky areas like the knees. The moisture serum surrounding the blades could replace shaving cream entirely which is great for someone like me who likes to keep things simple.</li>
            <li> So happy that I got to try this product free from Gillette Venus through BzzAgent! I have been using my husbands razor for so long but I won&#x27;t be anymore! I love that this has 5 blades and it does not pull hair or scrape your skin like other razors I have tried in the past. In fact it glides so smoothly that it doesn&#x27;t even feel like you are shaving, but you are! I also liked that I could quickly shave over my knees and other tough areas without having to slow down for fear of cutting my skin. It really made the process quicker and more enjoyable. I would recommend this product to anyone, and I will continue to purchase it for myself.</li>
            <li> I received this  item for free from bzz agent!Its not the smoothest shave you&#x27;ll ever get with a razor but it glides over your body so easily. I think if the blades were a little sharper it would have made a HUGE difference in the shave.</li>
            <li> I was able to try the great product free from BzzAgent and I am so happy I was able to. Let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s winter time and so my legs were neglected and needed a shave for Valentine&#x27;s Day, and it performed wonderfully! It glided over the hard to reach spots around my ankle and knee cap. I have been using men&#x27;s razors for about a year now and I&#x27;ll be using this purple, girl machine for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were to complain about anything it would be the size. It is bigger than the razor I was using previously, but it didn&#x27;t bother me in any way while using it.</li>
            <li> Love love love this razor got to try it thanks to Venus and bzzagent for making it all happen. This razor gives the closest shave I&#x27;ve gotten in a while and left my legs silky smooth with all those awesome blades</li>
            <li> Do not waste your  money. This is by far the worst razor I have ever bought. I will be going back to mens razor, the brand my husband uses. This ball thing on the razor is a complete joke. I actually had to hold the razor at the razor part to keep it on my skin. The ball only makes it twist; nothing special about that other than  making it not do what it is suppose to do. What a complete waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Nice razor and works well--- I just don&#x27;t really notice a difference in this razor and my other Venus embrace razor. Also too much goop on the razor blade but will do the trick!</li>
            <li> This razor is amazing and does not nick or cut. I decided to try it on a whim because I&#x27;ve used Venus products in the past. My husband used it mistakenly (he shaves his head) and has not stopped raving about it. He says it is very smooth and loves the moisture serum feature. We are both hooked!</li>
            <li> I love this razor. it gives you a close shave without the stubble and razor burn. my legs feel and look awesome. This is the best razor I have used and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I got to try the Venus Swirl for free thanks to Gillette.  The Venus Swirl razor is by far the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used!  I&#x27;m always nicking my knees when I shave with other razors, but not the Venus Swirl razor.  The Flexiball technology makes shaving my knees so easy and painless.  And the Venus Swirl&#x27;s five contour blades give a super close shave and leave my legs feeling so smooth!  I would definitely recommend the Venus Swirl.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this thanks to bzzagent.com.  I am normally a bic soleil user.  I like this razor overall and it gave me a really smooth shave even my underarms.  I was a little worried because the head seems awkwardly flat but it worked great. I loved the grip on the handle and the ease of use.  Overall I got a very close shave with no cuts or razor burns even underarms.  Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I receive this free as part of a promotion from the brand. So glad I did as this razor is amazing. First off, my armpits have never looked so good. Previously I felt like I would always miss some hair or it would still be visible somehow. Now with the Venus Swirl! Secondly, it glides along my legs like a dream. Its actually kind of fun to go from my ankle to my thigh without worrying about nicks or missing hair. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend to all my friends. I love this</li>
            <li> Not as cool as the commercial say. The rollerball doesn&#x27;t glide evenly. In fact I have used Venus for years and this seemed like the other but with added chrome.</li>
            <li> I was not so sure about spending  so much on a razor.  Other razors are cheaper but this one sounded amazing so I had to try it.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it I wasn&#x27;t so impressed and wondered what the hype was about. Then I tried it for a second time and understood. It was the most amazing razor handle I have used. Going around my knees and ankles was a breeze! I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve sliced my need or ankle because I hit it at the wrong angle. With this Venus razor the ball helps the entire razor pivot not just the head. So this helps avoid unnecessary, painful nicks.  I just wish the blades would be sharper and give a closer shave.</li>
            <li> Product provided free for review, courtesy of Gillette  I&#x27;ve never had a great experience with reusable razors. I don&#x27;t think that they really provide any better results than a disposable. I was hoping that the Venus swirl would be different, but it was not. I went in to this product with high hopes. I know that Venus is a top producer of female shaving products and I looked forward to the MoistureGlide component, but what I found was that this razor did not change my shaving routine at all. I thought that, as advertised, I would have to shave less. This was certainly not the case. I continued to have to shave my legs everyday in order to stay smooth. This was the case for my underarms as well, which can usually go two days. With this razor, I was shaving my underarms everyday. I also don&#x27;t think that the underarm shave was very close because halfway through the day, I was developing a five-o&#x27;clock shadow under my arms. I am also extremely disappointed in how short-lives the razor was. After 4-5 shaves, I was thinking that I needed a new razor. At nearly $28/box of 6 (on Amazon), the cartridges are some of the most expensive on the market and, from what I can tell, do not warrant that very high price tag. the shave itself isn&#x27;t bad. The MoistureGlide is nice and left my skin feeling soft, but the effects are short lived and because of the high price tag on the item, I can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> First and foremost, I love the packaging that it came in, which right away tells you what the product is about. The packaging also makes it very easy to open the product. The product (received as part of promotion from the brand on BzzAgent), comes with a cartridge of 5 contour blades and a flexiball. However, contrary to what I believed the flexiball does not rotate at a 360 degree angle, and instead only moves from right to left. This motion is balanced out by the blade head which moves only up and down. I liked that the cartridge comes with its own little container and easily attaches and removes itself from the razor. As someone who uses disposable razors, I was impressed by this product because it did its job exceptionally well. The blades did not hurt the skin at all and instead left my skin feeling soft and smooth, plus the flexiball helped in shaving the harder to shave areas, like under the armpit, bikini line, and around the elbows and knees. Although, despite the razor’s flexibility it was difficult to shave under the knee areas. One thing I really like about this razor is that it easily captured the hair in a short amount of time, that I soon found myself enjoying the shave rather than seeing it as a chore. Likewise, the hair also didn’t get stuck in the blades and was really easy to clean. Furthermore, the blade didn’t cut into the skin at all (a problem I have had with disposable razors) due to the MoistureGlide serum and the soft pads that surround the blades. The product is recommended to be used with soap or foam, however I only used water and happily there was no symptoms of irritation from sensitive skin. One thing that I didn’t really like is that after the shave, although my skin did feel smooth, there was still some red stubble, which went away after a few hours. Another issue I had was that the hair came back after 3 days, which was to be expected since it’s a razor so it doesn’t pluck hair from the roots, but I would have preferred that the effects lasted for at least a week. All in all, I do like the product and would recommend it as it is reusable and fares better than the disposable razors by the same name. However, the price of the replaceable blades is a bit too high, and is something that needs to be factored in.</li>
            <li> Good razor though I don&#x27;t feel like the shiny ball makes my shave any better.</li>
            <li> I got this shaver for free on BZZ agent thanks to Gillette.. It works really well and Is better than other shavers. I really recommend trying this shaver.</li>
            <li> I normally love Venus razors its all I use. I was given the venus embrace to try and review. I was hoping to love the new one because i thought, I love Venus and one that swivels would be an even better version great. I do not like the handle I see no difference in flexibility at all. The razor head is not a nice as the venus embrace and after 2 weeks it was dull and rusting and that was with me not leaving it in the shower. So I will still use Venus embrace just not this one.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like a ball forcing the head side-to-side, but I&#x27;m amazed at the control you have with this razor, even over tough spots (like ankles and knees), as well as more &amp;#34;delicate&amp;#34; areas.  This is my 3rd handle/bundle purchase (this one for travel), and I&#x27;ve been through probably a dozen of the heads... not one nick (yet), but I also use a good shaving cream, NOT soap, and don&#x27;t rush the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle allows movement &amp;#34;just enough&amp;#34; to the side to avoid nicks and cuts, and because it only moves side-to-side, it allows you to apply the right amount of pressure to ensure a smooth shave.  The 5-blade heads really make quick work of stubble in a single pass, and you can usually go an extra day between shaves (as compared to twin or triple-head razors (even the original Venus).  The handle is also less slippery than the Body handle or Original Venus handle.  These 5-blad heads also fit other Gillette handles, and the 3 and 4-blade heads fit this ball handle too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some comments have been harsh about the lube-strips &amp;#34;melting&amp;#34; on the heads, but honestly, I&#x27;ve not seen this issue, but I also don&#x27;t leave the razor face-down in a puddle after use... it hangs upright to dry (or lays blade-up on the shelf) after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heads cost a bit more, but I look for coupons and sales, and the heads do last considerably longer than the triple-blade versions, so cost per head sort of works out in the wash... If you&#x27;re looking for a new razor for the shower, give this one a try, and I think you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised... I was!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think there was a great deal of difference between razors before now. I&#x27;m not one to spend money on a &#x27;branded&#x27; item, when cheaper alternatives work just the same. However, the Venus Swirl  exceeded my expectations (I received a razor compliments of Gilette to try out). The Contour blades kept my legs smoother for longer. The MoistureGlide Serum did give me a smoother glide. The Flexiball technology made shaving such a delight, easily following all the curves of my legs. I highly recommend this razor!</li>
            <li> Did not buy on here but I wanted to let everyone know the truth about this &amp;#34;razor&amp;#34;. Ive been seeing it for about a month at Wal-Mart and target. So 3 days ago I finally decided to bite the bullet and get it. When I first got it I was super excited and had high expectations. I used it last night and thought hey this is nice. Woke up the next morning and couldn&#x27;t believe it. My legs were already hairy and felt like a cactus!!!!! I was so mad so when I got home from work I took a shower and tried it again and still could not get my legs smooth at all!!! I would rather get a dollar razor at the dollar tree then ever use this even if I got it for free! Please dont waste your money. And the &amp;#34;ball&amp;#34; is nothing special, it doesnt really work like the displays make it out to be.</li>
            <li> Great razor does not cut you easy to use. Nice design.</li>
            <li> Love it!! If you&#x27;re like me kind of cautious to shave on the knee area this is perfect!  It glides so effortless around angles its perfect.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to get the Venus swirl razor from BZZAGENT for free to provide my honest opinion.I love this razor! The packaging is easy to open -  no struggling with sharp, hard plastic. The tab in the back made it super convenient to actually USE the product you just purchased - what a thought! The razor itself is amazing. It glides! It effortlessly reaches tough to shave bikini areas, and everything is super smooth. My one complaint is the handle. It feels like it&#x27;s made of cheapter plastic, so it tends to get a bit slippery when it&#x27;s wet and soapy. Okay, I guess, if you like living on the edge. I still highly recommend this razor!</li>
            <li> I like all of the venus brand razors and I have tried each new one that comes out. They all work great but I never seem to notice a huge difference that would make me HAVE to have this one over any of other Venus razors.</li>
            <li> I received my Gillette Venus Swirl and love it. It&#x27;s a beautiful color. lots of blades and shaves so smooth and silky. I love it! I&#x27;m trying this product for free thanks to Gillette. Being a women, it sure is nice that there is a product out there can help. This summer, I&#x27;m looking forward to showing off my smooth shaved legs thanks to Gillette Venus Swirl. FUN! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I was able to use this awesome razor FREE thanks to Gillette and BzzAgent. I recommend this fabulous product to any woman out there!! The first time I used it it was like shaving with butter.. It glided across my skin like you would on a fresh ice skating rink...It was that smooth. The ball on this razor helps get in those tough to reach places that a normal razor would not get to. And for all those women that always on the go wether you are a mom or business women always working long hours, no worries at all because you don&#x27;t have to change the razor head for whole MONTH!! I LOVE MY GILLETTE VENUS SWIRL RAZOR😍</li>
            <li> Very smooth on flat parts, but still misses on the curves. You have to go over the curves a few time to get all the hair off.  But what&#x27;s new here?</li>
            <li> Great razor!  Reaches every angle and leaves skin smooth and soft!  Would recommend!</li>
            <li> The Razor works quite well and I do like it, but other than the flexiball it is pretty average. I definitely recommend it to those who have just started shaving, because the flexiball makes shaving your knees a breeze; but, to anyone who doesn&#x27;t need that kind of help, it isn&#x27;t really that much better than other brands. On a side note I got mine for free from Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> I received this awesome razor to try out from Venus called the Venus Swirl. Now due to it being the end of winter this little razor had a lot of work to do and it did it&#x27;s job fantastically. The blades provided a close shave.And the flexible design is AWESOME and finally made it possible for me to not cut the back of my ankle. My only complaint is while the moisture strips were one of the best I have seen on a razor I am still not a huge fan of them. It just makes the razor a bit too bulky for me.But The pros definitely out weigh the cons and I definitely will be buying refills.</li>
            <li> Hardly ever get a knick. Almost impossible!! Love it!</li>
            <li> This is an exceptional product and is greatly improved.  So far the razor and refills are well worth the increased price despite wishing that they were slightly less expensive!</li>
            <li> best razor I&#x27;ve ever used, just wish it were less expensive!</li>
            <li> I also received the Venus Swirl to try from Venus. There were many great things about this razor and I was mostly impressed by the closeness of the shave and the flexibility the Flexiball allows. I know that the cartridges may seem like a steep price when looking at the quantity, but the quality is worth it (and the color is pretty great too)! I have had an on again, off again relationship with Venus razors and feel as though they have redeemed themselves with this new razor. This razor has it all with the flexibility, five blade shave and the conditioning MoistureGlide. The only critique I would give this razor is to change the MoistureGlide formula so that it doesn&#x27;t stick to other things in the shower (it tends to get a bit goopy). My faith in the Venus razors has been restored and I hope that they will continue to improve their MoistureGlide formula.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor I have ever used it contours to your legs and leaves your legs smooth as ever !</li>
            <li> haha what a gimmick. this is just a regular razor just like all the other venus ones. The &amp;#34;swivel&amp;#34; part at the head hardly moves at all. Like literally, it moves around 1mm in each direction, and it does not rotate or swirl or swivel at all. That being said, it functions great as a regular razor, so that&#x27;s exactly what you&#x27;ll get. I bought it on Amazon because the prime price was $4 cheaper than my drugstore, so overall it was a good deal, even if it does not work as &amp;#34;swirly&amp;#34; as it is advertised.</li>
            <li> Great razor. Worth the money</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor! The design was light and slim and It was easy to hold and handle.  The shave was smooth like butter. I received this razor as a free promotion and will defiantly purchase in the future to continue use.</li>
            <li> I genuinely LOVE this razor. I used it right after I received it from Bzzagent and was super impressed. I have been using my old razor for so long and was definitely in need of a change. I love the flex ball because it really does allow the razor head to move better around my knee area which I often cut. I do still use shaving gel with it, but the moisture bar on the razor is also nice in terms of the razor gliding with more ease. I plan on keeping the gel, though. My legs were also so soft after shaving and the shave lasted longer than usual for me. I am super impressed with this and definitely will continue using it. Usually I don&#x27;t go for this brand because as a broke college student it&#x27;s a little pricey, but after trying it I think I can buy some extra blades. I&#x27;m no razor expert and everyone has different tastes and body types. This razor, though, definitely works for me.</li>
            <li> Having used multiple razors I have always been most impressed with Gillette Venus Products. Gillette is always on edge when it comes to new and innovative technology. I feel they have done it again with the Venus Swirl. The MicroFine comb literally grabs each hair so there is no reason to go back over any area more than once. The serum creates a very smooth shave, especially since I do not prefer to use shaving cream. Venus Swirl provided a very close shave all over including hard to shave areas like knees. Easy to open packaging when your eager to get your shave on! Awesome product! I received the product as a promotion through BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> Great new razor!  Love the swivel!</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome, dont know how I ever lived without it.</li>
            <li> I was sent this product by BzzAgent in the mail. I normally am not impressed with razors other than the one I normally use, HOWEVER, this one gives a fantastically close shave and leaves your legs looking and feeling soft and smooth. I will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I love my new venus swirl razor. It gives me a close shave that is painless without any cuts. My legs feel smooth to the touch. I can&#x27;t wait to use this razor on valetine&#x27;s day. My other razors just don&#x27;t compare to venus. I&#x27;m very happy to have the chance to try the Venus Swirl for free, thanks to Buzz Agent and Venus and Gillette.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this razor completely free thank to bzzagent along with the Gillette Venus Violet Swirl with a touch of Olay shaving cream, best combo ever!! This razor is amazing, the flexiball technology gets those hard to reach areas easily without nicking my skin. The 5 blade contour gets rid of all the stubborn stubble.  I CANNOT stop touching my silky smooth legs!!! This is the best shave I&#x27;ve gotten in a long time. I will only be buying this razor from now on! The design on the handle is even cute, my husband loved the way my legs felt and the shave and smoothness lasted longer than with most other razors I have tried. My search for the perfect razor/shave is over!!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this razor that I got to try courtesy of Gillette and Bzzagent.  I think my shave was smooth but after shaving my legs two times the razor started giving me bumps.  I needed to change to a different one.  I was happy to try this one out but I probably wouldn&#x27;t spend the money on it unless I was able to combine a sale with a coupon.</li>
            <li> I received this razor from Gillette and BzzAgent. I knew I would like the razor head itself because it&#x27;s a Venus and that is all I use but I was extremely skeptical about the handle. I didn&#x27;t think it would be bad but I didn&#x27;t really see what it had to offer. Until I used it. The ball in the handle allows smooth gliding even over trouble areas. It doesn&#x27;t move much but it&#x27;s enough that I haven&#x27;t knicked myself on my knees or heel. I found the head super easy to clean as I was using it as well. I will continue to buy refills. I&#x27;m completely convinced this is the best razor for women out there.</li>
            <li> Horrible product. The brand new blades were dull, I had to shave twice over and even that did not remove all the hair. Will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> My sister loves this thing, but the refills are outrageous.</li>
            <li> Awesome shave.... I received this razor free from an online promotion. I loved this razor. I normally get razor burn in my bikini area with this razor there was no razor burn. I am switching my current razor to this one. and will also have to buy my daughter some of them also. I love how the head swivels also.. It makes it so much easier to shave with it...</li>
            <li> I was able to review this product for free as a promotion from Gillette and BzzAgents and I am very impressed! I find that usually I have trouble using most razors because of my sensitive skin and the ridiculous amount of razor burn 9 out of 10 razors give me, but with the Venus Swirl that is far from the case. The razor leaves my skin silky smooth with no irritation and also no major nicks and cuts. I love that the ball helps contour the razor to my body. I&#x27;ve noticed that the blade doesn&#x27;t need changed very often (been using 3 weeks and still a very close shave and not clogged with hair.)  Just wish the ball had a little more movement than it does currently! But I&#x27;m still in love with the Venus Swirl and I can confidently say it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li> Love this razor. Does everything it&#x27;s supposed to do. Glides around the bones without knicking them. Shaves very smooth.</li>
            <li> This product is not worth the splurge! It left my legs full of stubble and not the smooth shave I was told. I had to pass the razor again and again but I still had quite a bit of stubble.The razor was not flexible enough to shave around the knees. I would not purchase this product again unless it is on sale. I was able to use this razor thanks to Gillette. Usually, I use men&#x27;s razors because I get really close shaves. I LOVE how the moisture strip did not become slimy! That makes it so much harder to shave! This razor did leave my skin moisturized and not dry like other razors do. The razor is very cute but for the price I might have to think about it. However, if you want to try a new razor and have a few extra bucks to spend why not give this razor a try?</li>
            <li> After using only two blade disposable razors this is absolutely the best my legs have ever felt! Thanks to Buzzagent I was chosen to try this product for free!! Love how cute the razor is and it works even better than it looks! It&#x27;s moisturizing strips work awesome when some of your shaving cream gets washed off. Definitely adds to the smoothness. All in all I&#x27;m totally buying refills for this beauty!!</li>
            <li> Wow, this was probably the best razor that I have ever used!  Super easy to use and left my skin so smooth!</li>
            <li> I was able to try the Venus swirl thanks to a sample from Venus. It&#x27;s a nice razor but I wouldn&#x27;t run out to buy it if you aren&#x27;t already in need of a razor. If your razor needs replacing this is a nice option. It gives a smooth shave and doesn&#x27;t feel rough at all. I have very fine hair which can sometimes be difficult for shaving because it bends so close to the skin that razors go right over the top without cutting the hair. This razor gave me a nice shave.</li>
            <li> Got this razor from BZZZ Agent...combined with the Gillette w/ Olay shaving cream, I LOVEEEEE IT. my inner thighs are hard to shave (they are curvy and very sensitive). This razor contorted to my thighs so well I will never buy another razor!!!!</li>
            <li> I was sent the product from BzzAgent. They don&#x27;t pay you to review products. When I first used the razor I was not impressed. I loved the Violet Swirl shaving gel from Gilette and Olay. It smells great, lathers well, and makes you skin feel smooth! Back to the razor - I didn&#x27;t like it the first time I used it. It gave me razor bumps. I loved it the second and third time I used it though. The first time I used it was on my legs (I didn&#x27;t have enough hair to shave I think) and I got razor bumps. The second time on my armpits and it worked wonderfully. I just used the razor on my bikini area and legs and they feel great. No razor bumps and no missed hairs! The ball really did help with the bikini area. I don&#x27;t notice all that much use of the ball on my legs though. Overall, I did enjoy this razor. It&#x27;s sharper than most women&#x27;s razors I&#x27;ve used in the past and I love the soap around the edge. I will definitely purchase this on my own.</li>
            <li> I got to try this razor as part of a BzzAgent campaign. I normally use men&#x27;s disposable razors. I like the color of this razor, and it has a very comfortable grip! I never felt like it was going to slip out of my hand, which is a problem I sometimes encounter with my usual disposal razors. I was really excited to see the roller ball, but it didn&#x27;t function in the way I expected. After using this razor for a couple weeks, I&#x27;m not really sure the roller ball is necessary. I suppose it allows me to shave without pressing down so hard against my skin, but the flexibility benefits end there, as I knicked myself on the very first shave. I do appreciate the Moisture Glide Serum, but considering that I use shaving gel, it doesn&#x27;t really add any benefit to my shave. I do think that this razor is providing me with a closer shave than a disposable razor.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about receiving the Gillette Venus Swirl from Bzzagent as a way to review the product. Like I said I was very excited about receiving a new razor. I could never figure out why men have better razors than women do, I mean we shave more than they do! The first night I inspected the razor itself before using it. I was really impressed with the design and how many blades were on it! The size of it was a little intimidating because my old razor was tiny! After inspecting it I then started to use it. The glide against my legs was smooth and after completing the task my legs have never been so smooth before and it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I then used the Venus Swirl in my armpits and it was so incredibly wonderful! Normally shaving my armpits is a task but this was so easy because of the movement of the head I didn&#x27;t think it worked correctly. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li> I was able to test this razor out thanks to Gillett and bzzagent. Overall I really enjoyed this product.  Results on my legs and Pitts are amazing!  The ball on the handle really allows me to get those tricky spots just right!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST Venus razor they ever made</li>
            <li> ...the shave is not nearly as close as it should be. Just because it doesn&#x27;t cut me doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m going to let it pass on giving me a smooth shave. That seems to be a theme in the reviews here as well.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving my legs for over 20 years now and let me tell you I have tried them alllll. I was so excited when I got to try the Venus Swirl for free thanks to Gillette.I have tried everything from the cheap 99 cents disposable razors to the more expensive disposable razors that one would find in Target, to the original Venus razor to an electric Remington razor and let me say the Venus Swirl is THE best I have tried thus far! It glided over my skin as it gave me a close, smooth shave. I literally had to check to see if it was actually touching my skin and shaving my hair, that&#x27;s how smooth it was. The MoistureGlide Serum really gives you a SUPERRRRR smooth shave. I have only been using it for a week now, so I am not sure how long the cartridges last, but regardless, it is worth it and I will be stocking up on additional cartridges.</li>
            <li> I am a user of 2 blade disposable razors, so receiving this product for trial from Gillette and BZZ was a treat. It&#x27;s a pretty purple color with a shiny flexible roller. It has Five Contour blades. It has&lt;br /&gt;Water-activated MoistureGlide Serum that surrounds the blades, which was a little too slimey feeling on my skin, but it allows for easier glide. I have been able to use the blade for several weeks, and it continues to perform. I would probably purchase the replacement blades for the product again to use during special occasions- since refills are costly for my budget-21.00 for a package of 4.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this razor out for free through a promotion (BzzAgent) thanks to Gillette and I love this razor SO much! Because it is positioned on a ball, it is very easy to get to places on my legs that I am normally not able to. I just recently had knee surgery and I was nervous that I would have problems with getting to areas on my legs due to my knee being weak, but with this razor I haven&#x27;t had any problems! I normally also have issues with missing places on my knees but this razor has made it SO easy to get all of the areas on my knees. I love also how this razor has a moisturizing barrier around the blades to help give me extra comfort. It really helps to decrease razor burn. Overall, I really love this razor!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite part of this razor is the cartridge. It lasted long, and gave me the closest shave on my legs that I&#x27;ve ever gotten. I was not a big fan of the roller ball. It seems really loose and makes me slip all the time. Overall, I&#x27;d like to use this cartridge on my Venus Embrace handle.</li>
            <li> Love this razor. I don&#x27;t need to use shave gel with it and it leaves my legs silky smooth. No razor burn. No nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Venus Swirl and Bzzagent, I got to try out this razor. I have been looking for a good razor for a while and was excited to try this. I really liked the conditioner bars on the razor as it left my skin really soft after shaving. The Flexiball isn&#x27;t as flexible as I thought it would be but that&#x27;s okay. The only thing that was a bummer was it didn&#x27;t have a cap or holder so when I used it next it got stuck to my shower shelf. Other than that I like this razor and would recommend it to others :)</li>
            <li> This is an amazing razor. I received the Venus Swirl Razor and Oil of Olay shaving cream from Gillette Venus. This Razor is awesome because it leaves no hair and keeps your legs soft and smooth. The feel of the handle makes it nice to shave with. I don&#x27;t think that I will find another razor that is this nice.</li>
            <li> I tried my free flex ball razor and Venus swirl shaving cream via bzzagent. The more I use the razor the more I don&#x27;t like it. :( The thing that doesn&#x27;t make sense to me....the ball only rotates right or left (like opening a door knob). Why would you need a razor that does that??? Makes no sense. The razor sharpness has lasted for a few weeks though which is great. The Venus swirl shaving cream is my favorite! I actually used my coupon and bought a big bottle. It smells so yummy!</li>
            <li> Received it on time and item as stated.  Great price</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;m glad I bought this at Walmart instead of Amazon, because the price on Amazon is ridiculous.  Whoa.  Anyway, on to the actual review...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been a Venus user for almost 20 years.  Unfortunately, I have dark, coarse, fast-growing hair that needs a daily shave.  Usually I&#x27;m pretty happy with Venus (although I&#x27;m looking seriously into an epilator).  This looked cool, so I thought I&#x27;d try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, the ball part is pretty much a gimmick.  The razor heads are already created to swivel to some degree, and most women have gotten so used to using a regular razor that the ball really doesn&#x27;t do a whole lot.  I find that I hold my razor near the head anyway, above the ball, to get a closer shave.  So the ball really does nothing for me at all.  If you are someone who actually uses the handle, then maybe it will be helpful, although I would think it would make it harder to get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cartridges have a thick lotion bar on it, but I just don&#x27;t get the whole lotion bar thing.  It only works when your skin is in water, like directly under a shower stream or in a bath.  It will not work if you turn your back on the shower and just use it on a wet leg.  If you do that, you will need a thin layer of something like soap or shave gel.  The lotion bar seems so thick that it didn&#x27;t really seem to shave as closely as it needed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take long, only a couple of weeks, for the lotion bar to wear down.  When that happens, this particular model seems to become very harsh and uncomfortable.  I went to the Venus website, and it states that if you shave daily, you need to replace the cartridge every week or two.  YIKES!  They cost way too much to buy a new one every week.  I realize that possibly that is how it has always been intended, but I have always been able to get almost two months out of one cartridge of the older models.  These particular ones seem to be made to purposely feel uncomfortable so that you are almost forced to replace your cartridge.  Totally not impressed when companies do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I am buying one of the older models....and will be looking into saving up for the Braun epilator soon so I can put this shaving junk behind me soon...I hope!are almost forced to replace your cartridge.  Totally not impressed when companies do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I am buying one of the older models....and will be looking into saving up for the Braun epilator soon so I can put this shaving junk behind me soon...I hope!</li>
            <li> These things have no real weight in them. Due to that flaw it slides all over the place when you shave your legs cause it&#x27;s too light. You have to be extremely careful from nipping yourself. Worst purchase ever, the swirl is nothing but just a catchy fad to a consumer.</li>
            <li> I got to try the Gillette Venus Swirl razor for FREE thanks to Gillette and got to give my honest feedback to Bzzagent. I honestly don&#x27;t think the razor is anything more special than any other razor on the market. I will break down the pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s.  Pro&#x27;s: It has 5 blades and the more blades the better. It has a swivel to it which makes it easy to reach the hard to get to places such as behind the knees and bikini area. It has a MoistureGlide serum that protects and keeps your skin moisturized. It last a long time as long as you take good care of it (my trick is to wash my razor&#x27;s after each use with hot water and an antibacterial soap, let dry completely and keep in a drawer).  Con&#x27;s: It feels like you are getting a close shave, but after a few hours you can already feel hair growing back. I easily get nicked every time I use this razor even when I am trying to be super careful. It makes my skin feel itchy and dry after shaving - I feel it is definitely not for people with sensitive skin.  In my honest opinion it is a good razor - not great. It does the job but if you have sensitive skin I would probably not purchase. It is kind of on the pricey side at $11.47 but it does last a good bit of time.</li>
            <li> This thing is a leg hair machete.</li>
            <li> Got a close shave , and the blades last about a month.</li>
            <li> these razors glide with my curves and give me a nice smooth shave. I&#x27;m hoping the blades don&#x27;t turn to crap in the next couple of weeks</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually review for products, but I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a month, and I really do think it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little background, I am pretty hairy and have thick armpit and leg hairs. The b&#x27;s just grow back so quickly. Previously, I was loyal to the Venus Embrace razor. At first I had a regular razor handle, but all of those snapped in half. The cheap, soft plastic material just wasn&#x27;t very durable for the few times you accidentally press too hard. I also tried razor designed for men like the Gilette Fusion, but found that the because the handle was too slippery, especially if you have some shaving cream suds leftover on your hand. Later, I found the Venus Snap travel size handle and was pretty excited because I was less likely to snap the little handle. My only issue was that although I loved the close shave of the Venus Embrace razor, sometimes I would angle the razor incorrectly, press a little too hard, shave a little too quickly, and end up digging a chunk of my skin off of my body. This occurred often at my knees and ankles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, when I saw ads for the Venus Rollerball, I thought it was just going to be a gimmick, but I bought it on impulse at Target, and I&#x27;m really glad I did. First of all, the razor head gives a super close shave. It has 5 blades plus the little &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; at the end, which helps you get the random hairs that rebel against the normal direction of hair growth. I no longer accidentally dig chunks of skin from my legs because the rollerball is responsive to the curve of your leg/body, and prevents me from holding the razor at the wrong direction. I sometimes still get random scratches from pressing too hard or pulling my skin too tight, but I can deal with scratches so long as I am not bleeding bullets for blood from shaving.The material of the handle also feels more sturdy than the old Venus handles. It&#x27;s made with a harder plastic that feels less like dried wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to anyone who often cuts themselves while shaving!</li>
            <li> Awesome. I rarely have any complaints about razors as long as it does the job...</li>
            <li> Great  razor.  I was always cutting myself with the old style razors. This razor glides over my skin  smoothly.</li>
            <li> Works Great!  I really like this razor.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my girlfriend as a gift and she loved it. I didn&#x27;t like the packaging but everything else came as expected. She liked it and it replaced it previous razor brand which was a tad more expensive. The blades also give a real nice shave, she went with the grain and it still worked. She has some thick hair so that means a lot. Also no irritation or red bumps ladies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this razor a couple times, but so far it seems amazing. I&#x27;m left smooth and silky after each shave. The razor isn&#x27;t &#x27;stiff&#x27; like usual razors and can &#x27;swerve&#x27; easily at bends in your body, such as your knees, which makes it a lot easier to shave them. It also glides across your body, none of that &#x27;pull&#x27; or &#x27;scrape&#x27; from other razors, while still taking the hair with it. It only takes a couple swipes of the razor in the most stubborn spots to take it all and make it baby-smooth. It even works amazingly well on the genital-area, no worries about leaving tiny cuts or having to do acrobatics and still miss some.  I have, however, noticed body-stubble showing up after a few hours, but I think that&#x27;s more my body than the razor. (I got this product from BzzAgent. I would certainly recommend it.) All in all, I still love my Schick Hydro Silk, but the Gillette Venus Swirl is an amazing addition. I will definitely be buying more refills.</li>
            <li> i loved my venus swirl that i received from bzzagent ! First lets get excited about the 5 BLADES!!!!!! women razors usually dont have 5 and we have to steal our boyfriends razors ! am i right? LOL So that was amazing and on top of it there is a swril ball so the blade can move around with out cutting us! Shaving your knees and lower leg can be a little tricky but the ball helps so much !</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! Thanks to Gillette and BzzAgent I was able to try this razor. I have always used mens razors for the close shave, but now i can actually use a razor designed for women that actual has the quality of a mans razor. Super close shave and the blade can actually be reused quit a few times. There is no slimy stuff on the razor after one use. Great shave! THANK YOU BZZAGENT AND GILLETE!</li>
            <li> Incredibly better than my older version of Venus!  I was quite pleased and surprised.</li>
            <li> I had been using my trusty Venus Embrace for many years when I decided to replace it with something new and fun. I found the Venus Swirl razor and I couldn&#x27;t wait for it to arrive! I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but it already is my favorite razor, hands down. This razor has the closest and smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. With the FlexiBall technology, the razor moves with your body&#x27;s curves to minimize cuts. The razor blades even have a moisture strip that on them to prevent any rough sliding and this came in handy for me when I ran out of shave gel and didn&#x27;t want to hop out of the shower to get another can. I was still able to finish shaving my legs with a smooth shave! I&#x27;m also delighted that I can finish using the blades from my Embrace razor with the Swirl so I don&#x27;t waste them. I&#x27;ve only been using this razor for a short time but now I get excited to shave because it&#x27;s the BEST razor I&#x27;ve ever had, my legs end up extremely smooth and it&#x27;s purple...my favorite color! I HIGHLY recommend this razor because it has already exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> Love this razor! Only complaint I have is I don&#x27;t think the blades last as long as most. But still one of the best razors I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> I received this for free through bzzagent. I was exited to try it out. And I have to say, I was not disappointed. It will be my go to and nothing else.</li>
            <li> I love this razor! I was given this razor to try from Gillette and BzzAgent, but that in no way influenced my review. I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting this razor to deliver everything that it claimed, because most cartridge razors don&#x27;t. I was pleasantly surprised to find this was not the case. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and I can honestly say it&#x27;s the best cartridge razor I have ever tried, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot. Whenever I shave I almost always miss hairs, because I&#x27;m unable to reach tricky areas with my razor. The Venus Swirl&#x27;s FlexiBall gave me the easiest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I somehow managed not to miss a single hair on my knees, ankles and armpits. Another thing I love is no slimy shaves! Most razors I&#x27;ve used become slimy after only a few shaves, but the Moisture Glide serum on this actually hasn&#x27;t yet. Lastly the grips are very nice and helps a lot whenever you use shave gel. I definitely recommend this product, and I&#x27;ll soon be purchasing refills for this!</li>
            <li> I Loved It Is The Best Raiser Even. you Have To Try It. I Knew About This Because Bzzange &amp; I Was So Happy To Get This &amp; I Will Buy This Agan &amp; Tell My Friends About It</li>
            <li> Gillette was kind enough to give me a free sample of Venus Swirl and I am so glad they did!  The MoistureGlide Serum gave a lotion-y feel as I shaved my legs.  I love the rubbery handle that made it easy to grip the razor.  I tend to nick and cut myself with shaving and between the good grip and smooth feet, I don&#x27;t need to worry about that anymore.</li>
            <li> I so love this razor! I got to try through BzzAgent, and I must say, I LOVE IT! I am used to using mens razors, or a lot of womens at one time, because the usual womens razor doesnt get the job done. I love the ball and that it lets the razor glide over every part of my legs to ensure an even shave. Would definetly reccomend!</li>
            <li> This razor is perfect for my sensitive skin. It&#x27;s easy to use and the handle has a good grip. The swiveling ball makes for a wide range of coverage and you&#x27;ll never miss a spot!</li>
            <li> The only issue is when you shave you feel great but after shaving, you&#x27;ll find some place bleeding. It&#x27;s the too wonderful feeling during shaving that makes you careless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Venus Embrace razors for a long time, and they&#x27;re my favorite razors. Recently I received this razor to try for free from BzzAgent. The razor itself is great (and I don&#x27;t think the razor for the venus swirl is any different than the one for the regular venus embrace other than the fact that it&#x27;s purple). But, I don&#x27;t the swirling ball part makes much of a difference. The razor only moves left or right around the ball (not how you would expect something to move around a swirl ball , like another reviewer mentioned, you might expect it to move like in those dyson commercials all around the ball, but it only moves a tiny bit in each direction)- so it only allows a limited range of additional movement that I don&#x27;t think makes a difference when shaving. The handle of the venus swirl is however nicer (it&#x27;s thick and has a gel-like feeling) -  So it does have a prettier design than a Venus Embrace, and comfier grip - but i&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s enough of a reason to buy it. If I needed to buy a new razor and this and the Venus Embrace were the same price I might grab this again just for the comfier handle and prettier look. Otherwise, I&#x27;d opt for the cheaper option - because this really doesn&#x27;t seem to have any functional improvement.</li>
            <li> I was able to use this razor thanks to Gillette and BzzAgent. Usually, I use men&#x27;s razors because I get really close shaves and the razor heads typically glide over my ankles, knees and underarms with ease. This razor gave me a very close shave! THe moisture strip doesn&#x27;t become slimy as other women&#x27;s razors usually do that have moisture strips-I just wish it lasted a little longer...I think it dried out after 2 weeks. This razor has a flex ball that allows the blades to glide flawlessly over ankles, knees and underarms. I really liked it and will continue to!</li>
            <li> BzzAgent gave me the opportunity to try this product for free.  It gave a very smooth shave.  The flexible movement prevented any cuts or nicks.  The lubrication prevented razor burn.  It was a very close shave.</li>
            <li> Love this razor! No more cuts on my ankles!</li>
            <li> Thanks to Gillette and BzzAgent I was able to try this amazing product for free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got the razor, although it had the unique Flexiball, I was skeptical about whether it would actually make a noticeable difference or not. I am so glad that I had the opportunity to try it, though, because it really did make a huge difference. It didn&#x27;t feel as rough around my ankles and knees. It hugged the curves of my body better, giving me a better shave and experience. In addition, the MoistureGlide Serum left my skin feeling a whole new level of silky smooth-without using any shaving cream!  This product has taken the &amp;#34;chore&amp;#34; of shaving and turned it into an enjoyable pampering experience. I can&#x27;t wait to buy more cartridges and permanently replace my current razor!</li>
            <li> Overall I love this razor. I think that it gave me a smooth close shave...which is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, what I thought could be improved is that there should be a cap/cover for the MoistureGlide serum, as it sticks to the shower.</li>
            <li> It felt smoother than butta! I was able to shave quickly and so close, I almost forgot I was shaving. No knicks, no razor burn, and so far no ingrown hairs. I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Venus, but this is above and beyond :)</li>
            <li> I received this razor and a coupon for shaving cream as a promotion from the brand. I like the razor design and the shave is also really close. The only problem I, personally, have with it is that if you have sensitive skin (such as myself), you pretty much HAVE to use shaving gel. And me already having sensitive skin, shaving cream isn&#x27;t much of an option for me. If there were a hydrating razor option, I would definitely give it another try!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally splurge on razors, but this one is really worth the money. BuzzAgent and Venus sent this product for me to try &amp; I love it! No more cheap throwaway razors for me! I&#x27;m a Venus Swirl girl now. This razor makes shaving feel like a spa treat. It adds something pretty and special to my shaving routine. One of my favorite features is the MoistureGlide serum which makes the blade effortlessly glide over your skin for a smooth moisturized silky smooth shave.

            <li> the best women&#x27;s razor out there! It rotates to the harder places, like behind the knee, it helped my skin become smother. It&#x27;s also affordable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not normally very picky when it comes to razors. That being said, this one was nothing special. There is a little bit of movement because of the ball, but nothing that in my opinion enhances its ability to shave. The blade quality itself is average. I wouldn&#x27;t change from my current brand of men&#x27;s razors(i am a woman) to this one. If you are looking for a woman&#x27;s razor, this one does it&#x27;s job, just don&#x27;t expect anything special because of the pivoting head.&lt;br /&gt;I received this sample for free and agreed to give an honest opinion</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t roll around smooth like it says it does. I got cut and the lotion line on top is already all most gone after first use.</li>
            <li> Who would have ever thought I&#x27;d be writing a 5 star review for a razor? Not me! But the Venus Swirl absolutely has earned a 5 star rating. I have always used disposal razors. But now I wonder why I did that for so long. I have to shave my underarms about every other day. I have a bunch of skin tags on my armpits and I don&#x27;t know how many times I knicked one of them, and it started to bleed. I absolutely HATE shaving my legs. I have been known to go weeks or even months (especially in the winter) without shaving my legs. It just something I dreaded. No matter how much shave cream I used or how careful I tried to be, I always ended up with knicks on both my legs. The worst spots were on the back of my calves and around my ankle. My mom would laugh at me because I&#x27;d come up from downstairs with 3-4 spot bandages on each leg to cover the knicks. Many times, they would bleed so much that I would have to put on a larger bandage by the time I walked back upstairs. I used disposable razors because they were cheap and convenient. I never really paid much attention to non-disposable razors. But then I saw an ad for the Flexball razor for men. I was intrigued, yet skeptical about the idea. I always thought, why should I pay more for a reusable razor when I can get about 5 bags of disposables for the same price? I always thought a razor is a razor. Yeah, knicking myself was a pain, but I figured it was just something I had to live with. So I was super excited when I saw an ad on tv that Gillette was coming out with a flexball version for women. I really didn&#x27;t expect there to be much difference...but I was curious enough to give a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Swirl is amazing! It gives you a close, comfortable shave, without irritating the skin at all. I love the lubrastrip. The razor just glides over the skin, and around your curves. I am able to go right over the skin tags on my underarms without knicking them. I haven&#x27;t knicked them once since I started using this razor. I also started using it on my legs. It removes the hair painlessly, quickly, and easily. Even on the areas that are most difficult to shave like around my ankle, and the front of my knees. I tried it this morning with no shave cream, just to see what would happen. It worked great. Best of all, no more knicks! I&#x27;ve used on my legs twice so far. Each time, I had one tiny, little knick that stopped bleeding by the time I finished my other leg. My legs feel smooth and amazing. I am sold on the Venus Swirl, and will recommend it every chance I get. This razor is so worth the price. I also like that the blades last pretty long. I find I can use the blade for about 2 months before I have to change it. So that is well worth the money as well. I will never go back to disposable razors.</li>
            <li> EXTREMELY SHARP, CLOSE shave! ;) Smoothest my legs ever been next to a good wax job. Ladies, it feels like the Gillette Fusion that your man uses.&lt;br /&gt;It does not have a gel type bar. It has a rubber/silicone bar which means it will not slip. Hence the warning.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, it is a very pretty, sleek design. I will purchase the Olay shaving gel  next time it will probably make it the ABSOLUTE perfect shave.</li>
            <li> I got this razor from BzzAgent for no cost. I was excited to try it because I&#x27;m always looking for a closer shave. I love the flexball design of this razor blade. It glides across your skin and provides your skin with moisture. No knicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> I loved this new razor .  Bzzagent sent it to me to check out and review.  The flex ball allows the razor to swivel in to hard to reach places.  I&#x27;ve used the venus line for years but this is the best one yet. It gives a super close shave and no razor burn.</li>
            <li> Love it! hew1290@gmail.com</li>
            <li> Thanks to Venus, I got to try out this product for free. It&#x27;s good quality and gives a close shave. The FLEXIBALL, which is the major selling feature for it, though, wasn&#x27;t anything special. It didn&#x27;t allow as much extra motion as it claims and there wasn&#x27;t any noticeable difference in the closeness of the shave. It&#x27;s a good razor and I will be using it regularly from now on, but like I said, it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li> So happy that I got to try this product free from Gillette Venus through BzzAgent! I have been using my disposable razors for so long but I won&#x27;t be anymore! I love that this has 5 blades and it does not pull hair or scrape your skin like other razors I have tried in the past. In fact it glides so smoothly that it doesn&#x27;t even feel like you are shaving, but you are! I also liked that I could quickly shave over my knees and other tough areas without having to slow down for fear of cutting my skin. It really made the process quicker and more enjoyable. I would recommend this product to anyone, and I will continue to purchase it for myself.</li>
            <li> I received the new Venus Swirl from BzzAgent! This was my first promotion that I received from BzzAgent, and I could not have been more excited! This product is AMAZING, it not only gets all the hard to get places but it is super easy to use! There is no more bending in awkward places or nearly falling down when trying to get that one hair that you can not reach. This razor left my legs silky smooth, razor burn free, and shiny! I highly recommend this razor!</li>
            <li> Great razor but wasnt impressed with the swivel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for about a month now and these are my thoughts on it.  First, it is very stylish; I love the way it looks.  Now, about that little silver ball meant to increase the razors ability to bend...it doesn&#x27;t really.  This works just the same as every other Venus razor I&#x27;ve tried; which is very good, just nothing different.  The matching blades are not really the type I personally care for.  They have a substance on them that allows you to shave with the razor alone; no soap or gel is needed.  This works pretty well but I still find I get a closer shave with soap.  I could just ignore the shave strips but the issue is that they get melted if they sit in water, so I have to make sure the little ledge I store it on stays relatively dry.  This can be a little hard in the shower of course.  After I finish using the two razor heads that came with it, I plan on switching to one of the other varieties.  That&#x27;s one of the best things about Venus razors: every handle fits every razor head.  I can just buy a variety more to my liking and still use this lovely handle.  So, overall, I am pleased with this razor but it is equal to other Venus razors; no huge breakthrough here.</li>
            <li> The shave is alright, no better really though than my old Schick Hydro-silk. The &amp;#34;flex-ball&amp;#34; really only moves side to side... It does glide fairly well over the knee area though. I just don&#x27;t see what the &amp;#34;hype&amp;#34; is all about, just another razor for us ladies (and/or gents) to dish out money on. *sigh*</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this razor! It gets so close and haven&#x27;t been cut by it once.I received this as a test product thanks to Venus and I love it and will buy the refills for it.</li>
            <li> Awesome, close shave. Has converted me from Schick Hydro Silk. No nicks and the blades last.</li>
            <li> Let me start of by saying I typically  use mens razors. They stay sharper longer and get a closer cut, so they save me money! But I was actually impressed by this razor in that department. It did stay decently sharp. I&#x27;m a mom of an 8 month old, that means shaving just doesn&#x27;t happen that often. So when it does, it needs a sharp razor to get through my leg hairs. And this was able to do it a few times before being demoted to arm pit razor. My main complaint is the outer rim was not needed. It just broke me out and got stuck to wherever I sat it. (I received this to try along with the not impressive shaving gel thanks to Venus and BzzAgent)</li>
            <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve ever had!!! It shaves so close and leaves my skin feeling so soft and silky. I highly recommend it! Not one little cut.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this razor it seriously leaves my skin the smoothest it&#x27;s been in years never thought a razor would be able to do that and it&#x27;s so easy to shave my hair!!!</li>
            <li> Love this razor- gets closer than any others I&#x27;ve tried on my underarms, which is a big deal for me, especially now that the weather is nicer and sleeveless is the way to go. Very impressed with the comfort of the handle, the closeness of the shave, and the overall appearance of my skin post-shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was given this product to try for free thanks to Gillette.</li>
            <li> My favorite part about this razor is the MoistureGlide serum.  It worked extremely well and I found myself skipping moisturizing afterwards like I normally would. I was also extremely impressed with the performance of the razor. It was very comfortable to hold and the shave I got was very close considering. Normally I do not shave my legs during the winter since I have no,reason to. With the disposables I used before it would take three or four razors to receive a close shave. With the Venus Swirl it took only two uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this razor courtesy of BzzAgent and Gillette for testing purposes. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I was able to use this razor thanks to Gillette and BzzAgent.  Usually, I use men&#x27;s razors because I get really close shaves and the razor heads typically glide over my ankles, knees and underarms with ease.  This razor gave me a very close shave - my legs are super soft in part due to the amazing moisture strip surrounding the cartridge head.  THe moisture strip doesn&#x27;t become slimy as other women&#x27;s razors usually do that have moisture strips. This razor has a flex ball that allows the blades to glide flawlessly over ankles, knees and underarms.  I know this is silly, but the razor is pretty!  It&#x27;s a pretty violet color with a swirl design on the handle - oh, and the handle also has rubber grippy strips on the side which help when your hands have shave gel or soap on them.  All in all, as a person who uses cartridge razors, I did like this one and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I saw this razor advertised on TV. I ordered it thru Amazon and I love the swivel head. great razor!</li>
            <li> I was given this razor by Gillette and Bzzagent as a promotion. I was highly pleased with how moisturizing the moisture strip was. I usually tend to buy the cheap dollar general razors and often come out of the shower with razor burns. The swirl I have tried with and without shaving cream, and I found that with no shaving cream, I still had that silky smooth feeling to my legs. However, I have found that the swirl ball it comes equipped with made no difference for me. It could be because I&#x27;m so used to having a routine to making sure I get the curves of my legs, such as with the knee and ankle, as no other razor has the swirl. It is very pretty, and caught my eye. Purple happens to be my favorite color.</li>
            <li> I was able to get this razor thanks to BzzAgent.com.&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with this one. I was using the Shick hydro, but I think that I might switch. Due to, I like how this razor is able to move, in different directions, and glides so smoothly. It also has a long handle with a good grip so no slip. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I tried this product free thanks to Gillette! -But that does not mean my opinion is swayed at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this razor to glide a lot more smoothly than anticipated. Whatever they used for lubrication is doing its job. It&#x27;s not slimy like some other  razors tend to feel, either. I was not expecting it to be so slippy at first and it threw me off, but I adapted quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a little getting used to how much it moves around, especially with how slippery it was, and with how much I rush in the shower.  Before getting in the shower, I was skeptical of its range of movement but as soon as I started using it, it was all sorts of moving around everywhere.  I&#x27;ve only used it once so far though, so perhaps after a few more uses I will adjust to its movement better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say that I am happy with the results, it left my legs super smooth and my underarms bump/rash free. I am looking forward to seeing hwo my second experience goes with this razor, and am especially looking forward to seeing how long this razor will last me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been unable to use standard ladies razors, they just didn&#x27;t work on my stubborn leg hair.  I &amp;#34;borrowed&amp;#34; my husband&#x27;s &amp;#34;man-razors&amp;#34; which is apparently frowned upon.  His razors gave me a close shave and took a lot of skin with the hair.  As a promotion, Gillette let me try the Venus Swirl for free- I honestly wouldn&#x27;t have purchased yet another razor I knew wouldn&#x27;t do the job.  This razor was fantastic!!  The flexible handle shaved around my knees without cutting them, and I was left with the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had!  My legs are now smooth and silky and my husband doesn&#x27;t give me dirty looks any longer because I&#x27;ve used his razor!</li>
            <li> I have been an extremely dedicated user of the Schick Intuition razor for 10 YEARS! I haven&#x27;t even considered trying another razor in all that time. But then BzzAgent came along and asked me if I wanted to be part of the campaign where Gillette would so kindly give one of these away for free for us to try. It was liberating! So much less clunky to hold than my old razor. The closeness of the shave was unbelievable! I am so in love with this razor - and it&#x27;s much less expensive than Intuition, which is even BETTER!</li>
            <li> I just tried this for free thanks to Gillette.  I have been using the Venus brand for a few years now.  I currently use the five blade Venus.  I liked this razor, the only problem I have is it sometimes moves too much.  I still get a close and smooth shave but I am just having a hard time getting use to it moving on me.  Other then that I really like this razor.</li>
            <li> ***I was able to try this product for free thanks to Gillette and Bzz Agent as part of a promotion***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve probably used &amp;#34;men&#x27;s&amp;#34; disposable razors for the last 10 years and I&#x27;ve used a Gillette Venus razor before when I was back in college so I was excited to give the Venus Swirl a try.  Out of the box, it looks and feels really great but I was expecting the silver pivoting head to move a lot more than it did.  The first time I tried it in the shower on my legs/underarms, I used the normal body wash soap I usually use, but I felt like everything was too slippery and it wasn&#x27;t shaving close enough.  I tried again and I really liked how it worked on my underarms.  It removed all the hair and left no bumps as I&#x27;m really sensitive there. The grip was also really good, but then again, I don&#x27;t have trouble holding my normal razor either.  I also liked the way the moisturizing strips make my skin feel.  However, after my shower I noticed that my legs still were not completely shaven!  I tried 2 more days in a row, with soap and without and still I could not get a close shave! I was really surprised!  I think because the head of the razor is so large due to the gel pad things, the &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34;, etc, all the little gadgets, it makes it too difficult for me to get a close shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing to point out is that because this razor is so huge/wide, its almost near impossible to shave your bikini line area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 3 starts because of the awesome job it did on my underarms (I&#x27;m actually going to keep it around, solely to use there) and because you really don&#x27;t need to use soap or shave gel with it because it has it built in.  However, I&#x27;m not going to waste time trying to shave my legs with it anymore, I&#x27;ll stick with my little disposable razor!</li>
            <li> I just purchased this razor to give it a try as my Schick hydro blade wore out. I was hoping a new technology would do better. I never get nicks when shaving. I just tried the razor and I have brokem, bleeding skin in multiple places on my legs. Again I have used other razors and never had this problem. I shaved both with and without cream. I will be contacting Gillette but wanted to state my experience on Amazon because that&#x27;s what I use to judge a product before purchase. I don&#x27;t recommend this razor unless the one I purchased is simply defective. I will give it another shot and will update my review if necessary.</li>
            <li> Glides so nicely over legs. Very smooth shave</li>
            <li> Best Razor I have ever used! This Venus Swirl has 5 blades similar to my current razor, Schick Quadro, so I feel that is a good comparison - similar in the closeness of the shave. What makes this razor stand apart is the flexibility of the blades to more easily shape my leg and pull more hair while shaving. The aspect I like the most and was not expecting, was the purple part that sits around the blades. I didn&#x27;t have any shaving cream but didn&#x27;t even need it with this razor. Now I wouldn&#x27;t do that often, I think you should use shaving cream, but it still went smoothly and I was able to shave my legs without any dryness or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;My one dislike: That purple part around the razor will sort of leak/rub off onto your counter top or in the shower when you set it down. I had a purple sort of glob on my shower when I went to pick it up. So I recommend hanging it so that it does not rest on anything.&lt;br /&gt;But again, I am in love with this razor and would highly recommend giving it a try.  I rarely shave my legs because I am blond so it doesn&#x27;t show, so I went a whole month without shaving. I just shaved with this last night and my legs are smooth and free of hair. Very good razor!</li>
            <li> Love the color. The blades last super long like other Venus blades. I was really excited to have the option of a swirl razor handle, that would make it easier to get into those hard-to-reach areas. However, the handle only moves right to left instead of up and down like I&#x27;d imagined. Does not work as desired.</li>
            <li> Really good razor. I like that the head swivels. No ingrown hairs or cuts.</li>
            <li> I received and used the Venus Swirl razor from Gillette on Wednesday night. It is now Friday night and I am still smooth and stubble free! I have psoriasis and usually get cut up pretty badly during shaving but for the first time in years I left the shower with no cuts! And it only helps that I will no longer need to shave my legs every day because every time I get a cut psoriasis usually follows. I did not receive any kind of cover for my razor which would be nice so that it doesn&#x27;t rust. Thank you Gillette for my Shave Kit!</li>
            <li> I recently got this in the mail thanks to BzzAgent. I was very excited to try it and I was very satisfied. I got a very close shave. I also loved how cute the actual razor was.</li>
            <li> AWSOME  I am so switching to this razor. It&#x27;s one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I am going to have my daughter use this when she learns to shave as it glides so well. and gets into all those hard to reach spots. Leaves ur skin feels so good. I got this from Venus for a product review for free</li>
            <li> Cheap but it gets the job done</li>
            <li> While I really liked the product overall, I was a bit dissapointed in the swirl ball, only because I thought it would move/swirl more than the tiny bit it did, That doesn&#x27;t mean it takes any of the power away from the shaving expeeience, I just would have liked to see the ball move around a bit more than it did.&lt;br /&gt;The actual shaving Part with this razor resulted in smooth and flawless shave and I really really love the design of the handle and the beautiful purple colors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this Razor as part of a promotion via Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> I bought this on impulse thinking it would be just ok. I was really surprised at how much a difference the swirl ball makes -- this was actually the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I received this razor to try for free thanks to Venus and Bzzagent and I am so glad I could do this!&lt;br /&gt;When I first received this product, I was excited and a bit skeptical. I had never seen a razor that was attached to a ball, and was interested in trying out. I&#x27;m glad I did! This razor produced so a soft, close shave. I didn&#x27;t feel like I knicked myself at all, and it was very painless.This has been my favorite razor in ages. This is a wonderful product that I will be for sure using and purchasing again.</li>
            <li> This razor is amazing I received free from Venus and buzz agent to review and give my option and experience but in no way was I influenced, this is my own review and experience with the Gillette Venus swirl razor.    This razor is amazing and awesome it comes with one cartilage and it has the ultimate movement for a perfect close shave even in the rough spots such as your Knees and ankles.  I am a woman but I&#x27;ve never been into using woman&#x27;s razors in my opinion mens razors always provided the closest smoothest shave for me without cuts and now that I&#x27;ve gotten to try this razor, I am in love and never going back to men&#x27;s razors it has everything I look for in a razor. It has five blades  and a water activated serum around the whole razor head for and smooth moisturizing shave with out getting all slimy. My legs were so smooth and soft like silk when I was done. The handle has a beautiful design it has some rubber so it&#x27;s easy to grip, the flexi ball provides the best movement you can ask for in a razor. To top it off it&#x27;s my favorite color purple I definitely recommend this razor to all my gal friends and family.</li>
            <li> Love this razor it has given me the closest shave yet and the smoothest LOVE VENUS</li>
            <li> I recently received a sample of this razor from Gillette as part of a promotion. I have used men&#x27;s razors for the past 5+ years after using some really poorly designed women&#x27;s razors but this razor has really changed that! I enjoyed the close shave that I got and the flexiball really made it easy to shave around my ankle and knee cap without any nicks! I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I was really happy with my shave results using the Venus Swirl Women&#x27;s Razor and even happier that Venus gave me the chance to try it! I thought I was happy with my current razor until I gave this one a try. It was super smooth &amp; I was able to get to all the tight spots and didn&#x27;t have to worry at all about cutting myself. The shave lasted for days longer than my normal razor.</li>
            <li> I love this new razor. I got it for free thanks to Venus, and it is the best new razor out there. I was able to get all the spots I normally miss with a regular razor.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Gillete and Bzzagent, I was able to receive this product as part of a promotion. I love it! The Venus Swirl with Flexiball worked to remove more hair the any other razor I have even used. Typically I do not shave as often during the winter, like most women I know, and this razor, with one swip, was able to remove the hair and leave a nice smooth feeling on my legs. This is not to mention the &amp;#34;pits.&amp;#34; I also used this on my arm-pits and I did not have to go back and reshave my armpits after shaving the first times! So great! and Would totally recommend this to ANYONE who would like a nice, close and clean shave!</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTLY LOVE THIS! Glides ever so smooth and no Knicks! I would deff recommend.I received the kit from BzzAgent.com!!!!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing razor! I received it free from bzzagent. I never thought my legs could be so smooth! I couldn&#x27;t even tell my legs were being shaved because of the 5 blades! I would definitely recommend the Venus Swirl razor to all women! It&#x27;s what I will be using from now on!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying this product for free thanks to Venus! So at first I thought this FlexiBall would be a gimmick. But its not! This razor really helped eliminate cuts while shaving, especially on my knees, because of the way it moves! It is actually pretty cool. I also usually hate razors with moisture strips because they get gooey and usually don&#x27;t work. These strips contain a moisture glide serum, though, and it actually works! I could get a smooth, burn free shave without shaving cream from this razor and that is super impressive to me!</li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t fall for all the hype with new razors that claim to be special and unique but I decided to buy it instead of my normal $8 3 pack of disposables. The actual shave felt nice- the razor seemed to glide pretty well. By the next day however, I felt as prickly as when I haven&#x27;t shaved in a couple of days. I thought maybe I just didn&#x27;t do a good job shaving so I used the razor again, made sure I was nice and smooth and didn&#x27;t miss any spots but again, by the next day I was prickly. I am so dissapointed that I spent $12 on a razor that is worse than a cheap 24pack of razors you can buy for $5. I wish I would have known that the company offers 2x your money back if you aren&#x27;t satisfied because I definitely would have saved the receipt and box. I can&#x27;t wait to get back to the store and buy my disposables so I can finally feel my nice soft legs again!</li>
            <li> In my opinion this razor has out done itself. Follows curves of leg, no nicks or cuts, best shave ever. You must try for yourself!</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of the best razors I have used before!  I received it from Venus to try and I am so glad they did because I am in love with Venus again!  I was using a different brand but was getting annoyed by the closeness of the shave, and my skin was very irritated.  Once I tried this razor, my skin was never cut and never irritated and it provided a super close shave that I have not experience in a long time!  Also, I am not scared with the razor to shave my armpits, knees, ankles and bikini area, and it does not get irritated, which is a huge relief for me!  I will definitely be purchasing this from now on!  Thank you Venus!</li>
            <li> I received the Venus Swirl Razor from the brand and I loved it. The flex ball technology makes it so easy to shave the contours of your legs. I lo ed the power behind the razor and how it made my legs feel in combination with the Venus Swirl with touch of Olay Shave Gel. This is a combination that I am sure to use for a long time. Before I got this product I wanted to know how well it removes hair and gives you a clean shave. This gives such a great shave and doesn&#x27;t take a long time to remove your hair. This is one of the best products I have used and think every lady needs to use this great feeling and great smelling product.</li>
            <li> Love this razor! So easy to use, and just as it&#x27;s advertised it makes shaving the curves and contours of your body much easier! No more razor knicks on my knees or ankles, which is awesome. The five blades are very nice too, but I like that with the razor handle you are able to use any variety of the Venus razor replacement blades. I would recommend this razor to anyone who shaves!</li>
            <li> I really like it and it works well</li>
            <li> easy shave with smooth results. After trying many razors i would recommend this for sure.</li>
            <li> I have purchased tons of razors trying to find one that left my skin feeling nice and smooth without getting awful razor burn and I had no luck. I was lucky enough to get to try The Venus Swirl for free and it&#x27;s absolutely amazing! Not only does it leave my skin feeling so smooth it&#x27;s got a flexiball so you can get a clean shave those hard to shave areas like your knees. The moisture strip is a bonus as I have dry skin and now my legs feel hydrated and not itchy. I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a month now and I haven&#x27;t once gotten any razor burns! I love this product and I would definitely recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I received this razor from Venus to be tried out. I have been using it for a couple of months now and I&#x27;m not totally impressed. The best part of this razor for me are the 5 blades. I have been using a Venus 3 blade razor for as long as I can remember. I had never really considerd trying a 5 blade razor simply because I thought my razor was doing the job it was meant to do. Well now that I have tried the 5 blade razor I actually enjoy shaving my legs! My legs feel extra smooth right after I shave and that smoothness lasts longer. I absolutely love that! Aside from the 5 blades, the other part that I love about this razor is the color and overall design. I  Think it&#x27;s such a good looking razor that it makes me want to shave my legs instead of feeling like it&#x27;s a chore. There are 2 main downsides that I find in this razor. One thing is the price. It is advertised to pivot in ways that make shaving easier and more efficient. Well I did not find the flexi-ball to help me in any way. For that reason I think this razor is over priced. Another issue that I have had with this razor is he grip. My old razor had a rubber type grip over and under the razor. This one only has grip on the underside of the razor and for that reason I have had it slip out of my hands a few times. Pros -Love the 5 blades -Beautiful color and design  Cons -Price -Not the best grip</li>
            <li> Thanks to Venus for letting me try this amazing razor! I used to use a different razor, Schick Intuition, for quite a while, probably somewhere around 6 or 7 years, but this razor proved to me why it should be my new razor! The 5 blades get every single hair, the flexiball makes shaving around your ankles, by your knees and under your arms so much easier! Glad I made the switch! And no I wasn&#x27;t paid to give this review, if I didn&#x27;t like the razor I would be honest and say I didn&#x27;t but lets just say that I found my new favorite razor!</li>
            <li> This razor is awesome, definitely the best ive tried thus far. and its way cheaper to buy through amazon than in stores.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying this razor, it&#x27;s different than others and def worth trying</li>
            <li> This handle is the worst! It it so slippery when you use it in the shower, I dropped it 6 times using it. It also squeaks when it goes over curves. Going back to my regular Venus razor. Not well thought out by Gillette. Glad they have a money back guarantee!</li>
            <li> I was recently able to try this razor free from Gillette and let me tell you, I got the closest shave I have EVER had.  I typically stick to men&#x27;s razors because I&#x27;m 5&#x27;10&amp;#34; and have a lot of leg to cover.  Women&#x27;s razors typically just don&#x27;t &amp;#34;cut it&amp;#34; for me.  This razor has been the exception and I highly recommend it to any woman, especially those who need a closer shave around the knee and ankle.  The flexi-ball technology allows the razor blade to pivot both up and down and side to side, allowing for excellent skin coverage.  Well done, Gillette!</li>
            <li> This razor had a very chic look about it. I really loved the dark purple color. I was very pleased with the flex ball on the razor, although I thought that the flex ball would move a little more than it actually did. Over all this razor was pretty good. I will be buying refill blades in the near future. I was very very impressed with the way I was able to reach all of those hard to reach areas under my arms, knee caps and behind my needs.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this razor that I received through Gillette and a bzzagent campaign. The flexiball technology gives great motion for those knee caps, armpits, and boney ankles. It didn&#x27;t really feel like I was shaving, but when I was done a had a smooth, close, comfortable shave. I will definitely get more cartridges for this great Venus handle!</li>
            <li> Thanks to Gillette, I got to test this razor out for free. What I like about it is: the beautiful design and packaging, the protecting soap strips, and how  it glides on my legs. What I didn&#x27;t like was: it doesn&#x27;t remove all the hair and I notice areas where it burn my skin but it didn&#x27;t leave any nasty marks, it just hurts. Will I go and purchase this for myself, probably not but I do appreciate Venus trying to create a better razor.</li>
            <li> Wow! smoothest shave ever! I love that I was able to get my most difficult spots, my knees, with no trouble using this razor. I love that it moves to fit the contours of my legs.I got to try these free from the company which makes this even better. Thanks Venus.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor that gives the closeness of a man&#x27;s razor. The head contains some serious moisturizers and didnt irritate my skin at all! I received this razor as a promotion from Venus and was anxious to try it out! I dont have to shave my legs everyday! The only reason i put 4 stars is because the head didnt move as much as i had anticipated but it is a wonderful razor</li>
            <li> I got this FREE to review from Bzzagent its prob. the greatest womens razor EVER I love it so much !!! it can take on ANY CURVE It is the 1st razor to not cut my knee when taking it over and I was surprised im not afraid to shave my knees anymore :) also the shaving cream smells amazing too I love it you need this and it has a long smooth lasting shave and even a lather or like a coating around the blades so you dont even need shaving cream if you prefer</li>
            <li> My wife received this fancy razor from Venus to try for free. She already uses a Venus brand (disposable) razor and wasn&#x27;t sure the experience would get much better, but she was pleasantly surprised by the movement and close shave of this razor. The gentle movement and swivel follows your body&#x27;s natural contour to get a nice close shave every time, everywhere.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my GF. She says they work good on her legs but give her razor burn under her arms.  Has some purple stuff around the razor, I left it sitting on the wet sink and it got all gooey.  Just my two cents.</li>
            <li> If you have the Venus razor, you have this one, not enough difference to purchase this one too.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy who&#x27;s used a Venus razor to shave my head for years, and this is a nice improvement on a good design. A main benefit of the Venus blade design is to shave shin-bone and ankle areas without taking a skin sample. And likewise it shaves smoothly across my scalp without the scrapes I was getting from otherwise great blades designed for shaving a face.</li>
            <li> Very Good razor I was very happy with the very close shave! I am very happy bzzagent let me test this product!</li>
