            <li>These are the best I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>Bic used to be  the best</li>
            <li>Best razor on the market.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t find them in my market for the longest time, great razor!</li>
            <li>Though it isn&#x27;t Bic&#x27;s BEST razors; they still do the trick if you take your time and watch your swiping with precision.</li>
            <li>I found them and I am very happy Thank you.</li>
            <li>He is very, very happy</li>
            <li>Very good for what it is used for.</li>
            <li>, they do a damn good job!</li>
            <li>Great item for the price</li>
            <li>great for neck hairs &amp; where an electric shaver can&#x27;t get.</li>
            <li>Great price for product..</li>
            <li>What a great deal.  </li>
            <li>They work great even though I haven&#x27;t used all of them yet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not an experienced shaver -</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a great razor to have for using once and then throwing away, and it just did not work for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seriously, it&#x27;s a great razor at 2-5% the cost of multi-blade disposables.</li>
            <li>Great product, great price.</li>
            <li>Great - what more can you say!</li>
            <li>Not too good, cuts you when using them.  </li>
            <li>(and I&#x27;ve been shaving for decades) and besides that they just don&#x27;t give a good shave.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Love &#x27;em!  </li>
            <li>Great razors...nice to get the heavier plastic ones instead of the light plastic bodies.</li>
            <li>nice disposable razors</li>
            <li>that is more effective (for me) than the multi blade shavers.</li>
            <li>Good cheap razors.</li>
            <li>Great deal, quick shipping and sure beats paying 4 dollars foe a pack of twelve razors.</li>
            <li>You will get a great shave if you use this the right way:&lt;br /&gt;use</li>
            <li>:-))</li>
            <li>Probable best single blade disposable razoe out there.  </li>
            <li>I must be very lucky.  </li>
            <li>so these are fine.  </li>
            <li>These razors do the trick just fine</li>
            <li>Get the job done fine.</li>
            <li>cheap...</li>
            <li>I do have a light beard and get about 2 weeks out of a razor.</li>
            <li>Since these original, single-blade, BIC disposable razors become hard to find, I began buying my husband the latest &amp; greatest fancy multi-blade disposables and he just hates them.</li>
            <li>I watch people spend top dollars for these 4 and 5 blade razors that doesn&#x27;t work no where as good as these single blade razor</li>
            <li>These razors give me a clean, no nick shave.</li>
            <li>But not inline with multi blade units sold at big box stores but for the price there good</li>
            <li>Some sellers are charging a fortune for these, but I got mine here on Amazon at $13.50 for 12 5-Packs, just 22.5Â¢ each, &amp; they last a good number of days each.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was quick and package arrived as expected in great shape.  </li>
            <li>I forgot my razor and needed a quick replacement.</li>
            <li>Someone dumbed down a great product and turned it into a &amp;#34;use</li>
            <li>COOL AND HANDY, THIS SHOULD LAST ME FOR AWHILE, THANKS!!</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had such a good close shave since 2007 when these REAL, white-handled (not &amp;#34;Sensitive Skin&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I recall when these first came out;</li>
            <li>Gives me a better shave than multi- blade systems ( I&#x27;ve tried numerous types since these all but disappeared in stores ).</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more of these.</li>
            <li>Cut myself 3 times first attempt to use this razor.</li>
            <li>My skin tends to be a bit on the sensitive side, but no matter how light the pressure is that I use when using these razors, I get nicked.</li>
            <li>out of my ankle at first use</li>
            <li>Perfect, better than any of these stupid multi blade gimmicks that don&#x27;t work and cost a fortune.</li>
            <li>real shaving cream</li>
            <li>At the same time, the two bladed Bic for Sensitive Skin is one of the better razors I have used.</li>
            <li>use them twice and toss them away, cheap but not good for more than 2 uses.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy the expensive replaceable or electric razors, this is a great razor.</li>
            <li>I used a brand new blade on my legs today</li>
            <li>Alright single blade razors super inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and always get shaving bumps.</li>
            <li>I have no idea if I&#x27;m doing something different than most folks other than not shaving on weekends unless we&#x27;re going out to or for something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced, easy to use on moderately heavy facial hair.</li>
            <li>This will last me a very long time and worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>and I can clearly see the difference.</li>
            <li>Should have gotten sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I use room temp water instead of shaving cream or soap, use a damp washcloth frequently on the area</li>
            <li>I am over 70 years old.</li>
            <li>I admit for a long time I didn&#x27;t really believe the new models were so ineffective, thinking he was just resistant to the change.</li>
            <li>A great disappointment because some people with sensitive skin rely on just the simple razor!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve ever purchased disposable razors that absolutely do not work.</li>
            <li>They dull very quickly.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s not a big fan of the new styles.</li>
            <li>When I first used the razor, I thought I could shave like I was using a sensor or other $4 cartridge.</li>
            <li>They barely work at all.</li>
            <li>People say I look younger - an unexpected benefit.  </li>
            <li>They will cut your face if not careful</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin on my inner legs and using the fancy multi-blade razors that you find in the drugstore leaves me covered with razor burn and ingrown hairs -- yuck!</li>
            <li>I go pretty slow, not too much pressure, check with my fingers to feel where I need to go over again or maybe go against the grain or sideways to the grain.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m old school when it comes to shaving and all i use is the Biz single blade razors because they are the sharpest and stay that way the longest</li>

            <li> but these  dont last very  long</li>
            <li> very inexpensive, but not very good quality</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t the same as the bic single blade razors I&#x27;ve been using for years.</li>
            <li> All other razors do not agree with me except the simple BIC disposable, single blade razor.  </li>
            <li> I dry shave after a shower....</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re single blade....</li>
            <li> Single blade disposable</li>
            <li> The single blade decreases the bumps and I always have the hardest time finding them.</li>
            <li> I wish that BIC still stocked their single blade metal razors.</li>
            <li> The single blade allows you to angle it for how close you want to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Received on time and as expected...</li>
            <li> After several years of unhappy shaving and my finally realizing it was a legitimate gripe, I went looking for the old standard Bics.</li>
            <li> ;) Bic razors became unavailable in U.S. stores for secret reasons!  </li>
            <li> and I have enough to last me at least a year, if not two!</li>
            <li> It seems I can usually make one of these razors last me close to a month.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s what I use and these are a little harsh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a few months now.</li>
            <li> Yeah I was pretty psyched to get these based on other people&#x27;s reviews, but I am really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Too bad these are hard too find, when something works they take it off the market to screw the consumer and ask for a higher price.</li>
            <li> These are not anything like the BiCs I used to get in the past.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to find single-blade razors these days.</li>
            <li> before it&#x27;s too late</li>
            <li> one time only&amp;#34; farce.</li>
            <li> Poorly designed.</li>
            <li> , close shave  is questionable</li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> I will probably never run out of razors; but the old-style, wider-blade shavers are almost impossible to find.  </li>
            <li> In fear that these will at some point become impossible to find, I am going to order a bunch.</li>
            <li> Holy Crap!  </li>
            <li> Worst razor</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> These are horrible.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great item for the price</li>
            <li> These are the best I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;Just use coconut oil and these.  done.</li>
            <li> COOL AND HANDY, THIS SHOULD LAST ME FOR AWHILE, THANKS!!</li>
            <li> Bleh!! Bic used to be  the best but these  dont last very  long, close shave  is questionable and Ive had  a total dud in one of the  bags.  Time  to switch brands</li>
            <li> Very good for what it is used for.</li>
            <li> Bic disposable is WAY sharper and smoother than a Schick</li>
            <li> great for neck hairs &amp; where an electric shaver can&#x27;t get.</li>
            <li> Received on time and as expected...Great price for product..</li>
            <li> Alright single blade razors super inexpensive.  Probable best single blade disposable razoe out there.  But not inline with multi blade units sold at big box stores but for the price there good</li>
            <li> use them twice and toss them away, cheap but not good for more than 2 uses. I recall when these first came out;</li>
            <li> Holy Crap!  What a great deal.  Couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes when they showed up.</li>
            <li> I will probably never run out of razors; but the old-style, wider-blade shavers are almost impossible to find.  Prompt shipment.</li>
            <li> They work great even though I haven&#x27;t used all of them yet.</li>
            <li> Not too good, cuts you when using them.  I would not buy these again and wish I could send them back because I will hold on to them for several years, never use them and finally throw them out</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had such a good close shave since 2007 when these REAL, white-handled (not &amp;#34;Sensitive Skin&amp;#34;) Bic razors became unavailable in U.S. stores for secret reasons!  Now &amp;#34;5 O&#x27;Clock shadow&amp;#34; returns at 5 O&#x27;Clock, not at noon!  Some sellers are charging a fortune for these, but I got mine here on Amazon at $13.50 for 12 5-Packs, just 22.5Â¢ each, &amp; they last a good number of days each.  Love &#x27;em!  :-))</li>
            <li> Should have gotten sensitive skin that&#x27;s what I use and these are a little harsh.</li>

            <li> Best razor on the market.</li>
            <li> These are not anything like the BiCs I used to get in the past. They barely work at all. Someone dumbed down a great product and turned it into a &amp;#34;use one time only&amp;#34; farce. Buy something else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not picky so these are fine.  They&#x27;re single blade.... cheap... no bells or whistles.  I&#x27;ll buy these again.</li>
            <li> Gives me a better shave than multi- blade systems ( I&#x27;ve tried numerous types since these all but disappeared in stores ). Store submerged in cup of water between shaves, and blade life is extended.</li>
            <li> Gillette doesn&#x27;t even compare to these Bic blades. They give me a closer shave than any Gillette product.;Buy it before it&#x27;s too late</li>
            <li> I have searched everywhere for these in my local stores, it as if they just stopped carrying them!  A great disappointment because some people with sensitive skin rely on just the simple razor!  All other razors do not agree with me except the simple BIC disposable, single blade razor.  Thank you for selling them!  Shipping was quick and package arrived as expected in great shape.  This will last me a very long time and worth every penny!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Single blade disposable that is more effective (for me) than the multi blade shavers. I dry shave after a shower....</li>
            <li> Just what I needed! Reasonably priced, easy to use on moderately heavy facial hair. I use room temp water instead of shaving cream or soap, use a damp washcloth frequently on the area I&#x27;m shaving.  I go pretty slow, not too much pressure, check with my fingers to feel where I need to go over again or maybe go against the grain or sideways to the grain. I&#x27;m not an experienced shaver - at 50 decided to go beardless. People say I look younger - an unexpected benefit.  I will definitely buy more of these.</li>
            <li> i dont care for them my female roomate likes them. i&#x27;ll continue with my Harrys shaver.</li>
            <li> Cut myself 3 times first attempt to use this razor. I am over 70 years old. I know how to ease pressure and shave with the grain to minimize nicks. But if I desired in any way to get a close shave,  could not do so using this razor. Worst razor I have ever used. At the same time, the two bladed Bic for Sensitive Skin is one of the better razors I have used.</li>
            <li> Great razors...nice to get the heavier plastic ones instead of the light plastic bodies.</li>
            <li> They will cut your face if not careful</li>
            <li> My sink looks like a crime scene!!! There is blood everywhere!!!!!</li>
            <li> nice disposable razors</li>
            <li> very inexpensive, but not very good quality..  need to toss each razor after just a couple shaves.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find them in my market for the longest time, great razor!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to find single-blade razors these days. I have sensitive skin on my inner legs and using the fancy multi-blade razors that you find in the drugstore leaves me covered with razor burn and ingrown hairs -- yuck! These razors do the trick just fine and I have enough to last me at least a year, if not two!</li>
            <li> a gppd deal, the inconsistent sharpness.</li>
            <li> I bought these blades when I was in a hurry. I forgot my razor and needed a quick replacement. When I first used the razor, I thought I could shave like I was using a sensor or other $4 cartridge. Wrong. If anyone complains about this razor, the cause is haste / user error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades shave like an old-school safety razor. You will get a great shave if you use this the right way:&lt;br /&gt;use real shaving cream; I use Edge gel or Art of Shaving shave cream;&lt;br /&gt;use a mirror;&lt;br /&gt;go with the grain;&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t double shave areas (you don&#x27;t need to!);&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without the hassle of three, four or five blades in the way, I can get under my nose, I get a smoother shave and my skin isn&#x27;t irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If fact, Bic has convinced me to make this my backup blade for travel, and I bought a Edwin Jagger DE razor from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great deal, quick shipping and sure beats paying 4 dollars foe a pack of twelve razors. I watch people spend top dollars for these 4 and 5 blade razors that doesn&#x27;t work no where as good as these single blade razor</li>
            <li> I think the title says it all. I thought this would be a great razor to have for using once and then throwing away, and it just did not work for me. My skin tends to be a bit on the sensitive side, but no matter how light the pressure is that I use when using these razors, I get nicked. Terrible.</li>
            <li> I bought these so I can do a simple trim on my sideburns.  I put a bag in each of the kids stockings.</li>
            <li> These razors don&#x27;t even cut water!  It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve ever purchased disposable razors that absolutely do not work.</li>
            <li> Yeah I was pretty psyched to get these based on other people&#x27;s reviews, but I am really disappointed. I cut the %$&amp;*# out of my ankle at first use (and I&#x27;ve been shaving for decades) and besides that they just don&#x27;t give a good shave. I used a brand new blade on my legs today and I had stubble immediately after shaving! My husband tried the razors too and found the same thing - not a close enough shave and stubble way too soon.</li>
            <li> This almost got five stars! Though it isn&#x27;t Bic&#x27;s BEST razors; they still do the trick if you take your time and watch your swiping with precision. Save your money, shave at night for a no rush delight.</li>
            <li> These razors give me a clean, no nick shave. I do have a light beard and get about 2 weeks out of a razor. I rinse the razor in rubbing alcohol after every use to prevent corrosion. This makes the razor last longer.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and always get shaving bumps. The single blade decreases the bumps and I always have the hardest time finding them. These solve all my problems in one simple purchase</li>
            <li> I will always need razors. So I waited and shopped around. I found them and I am very happy Thank you.</li>
            <li> Good cheap razors. Get the job done fine.</li>
            <li> Poorly designed. I wish that BIC still stocked their single blade metal razors.</li>
            <li> Perfect, better than any of these stupid multi blade gimmicks that don&#x27;t work and cost a fortune. Too bad these are hard too find, when something works they take it off the market to screw the consumer and ask for a higher price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a few months now. Don&#x27;t buy the expensive replaceable or electric razors, this is a great razor. The single blade allows you to angle it for how close you want to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, it&#x27;s a great razor at 2-5% the cost of multi-blade disposables.</li>
            <li> I must be very lucky.  It seems I can usually make one of these razors last me close to a month.  I have no idea if I&#x27;m doing something different than most folks other than not shaving on weekends unless we&#x27;re going out to or for something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than once for a very short while in the mid 70s when I thought an electric shaved would be the answer, I have been using Bic razors almost exclusively.  Face it (pun intended), they do a damn good job!</li>
            <li> These are horrible. They aren&#x27;t the same as the bic single blade razors I&#x27;ve been using for years. My legs are bleeding in ten places after using them this morning.</li>
            <li> Got these &amp;#34;retro&amp;#34; razors for my wife.  She loves them.  She&#x27;s not a big fan of the new styles.</li>
            <li> Since these original, single-blade, BIC disposable razors become hard to find, I began buying my husband the latest &amp; greatest fancy multi-blade disposables and he just hates them. I have tried every brand there is but the result is the same. They don&#x27;t work for him. I admit for a long time I didn&#x27;t really believe the new models were so ineffective, thinking he was just resistant to the change. Nope. After several years of unhappy shaving and my finally realizing it was a legitimate gripe, I went looking for the old standard Bics. When I handed them over, you would think it was Christmas. He is very, very happy and I can clearly see the difference. In fear that these will at some point become impossible to find, I am going to order a bunch.</li>
            <li> They dull very quickly.</li>
            <li> Great - what more can you say!</li>
            <li> Great product, great price. Very satisfied.</li>
