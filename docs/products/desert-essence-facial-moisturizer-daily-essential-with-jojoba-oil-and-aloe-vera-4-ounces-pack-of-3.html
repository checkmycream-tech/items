            <li>I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>My fave lotion at a good price</li>
            <li>It feels good on my skin</li>
            <li>But this price is so good, and that&#x27;s just for winter...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a senior, and this makes my skin feel good whenever I put it on.</li>
            <li>It was a great price and a nice sized jar.</li>
            <li>Her skin has never looked better!  </li>
            <li>I might be able to use it as a body moisturizer, but not what I had intended purchasing it for...disappointed!</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t know these folks, so they didn&#x27;t HAVE to be nice . .  .</li>
            <li>Bought 3 containers of this lotion I liked it until they mildewed.  </li>
            <li>Seems just as nice as lotion that costs 3-4x more at the spa.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful, effective product which I use daily!  </li>
            <li>I love this cream because it is non greasy-</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>\\&quot;That can&#x27;t be you, MAYBE 48 at the most . . .</li>
            <li>Best facial moisturizer I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Took care of pimples and made my skin look better.</li>
            <li>This is best facial moisturizer I have found for the money.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I apply in the morning, then use some more around the eyes before bed.</li>
            <li>Once I apply it, my skin feels much better.</li>
            <li>I will order more when this cream comes available again.</li>
            <li>The drying and redness that she was suffering from due to the chemicals in ProActive have gone away, and now she just has a beautiful, even skin tone!</li>
            <li>Desert Essence is silky smooth, and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.  </li>
            <li>Really, this is such a wonderful price...</li>
            <li>After a minute or so, my face started to break out in a bright red rash and my skin was on fire.  </li>
            <li>Paid more at Whole Foods than we do here.  </li>
            <li>I like that it is SPF free because why do I need so much SPF on my face in the winter here in NH?  </li>
            <li>Have been using this more natural alternative for a couple years now.  </li>
            <li>When I saw the deal for three jars I purchased right away.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and works really well, not irritating, and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>I purchased my first jar on special at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>Reasonably safe ingredient list according to the EWG Skin Deep database.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my face smooth and soft but not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>It is a great face cream for sensitive skin or for people who want a simple natural product.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t smart if it gets into my eyes accidentally.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Amazon is much cheaper than the Whole Foods price.</li>
            <li>It is lightly scented, and is white.</li>
            <li>I had originally bought this product for my daughter to use as a companion to the Desert Essence Tea Tree facial wash.  </li>
            <li>My skin breaks out and or/gets red and extra oily with most store products, so I figured I&#x27;d give this a try.  </li>
            <li>And the main reason I am hooked is that the company does not partake in animal testing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get any particular smell from the product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of thick without feeling greasy or like</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to fragrance and this is mild enough that it doesn&#x27;t cause a problem.  </li>
            <li>I use it night and morning and sometimes on my elbows when they get super dry.</li>
            <li>and it made her skin soft!  </li>
            <li>My face feels so soft, too!  </li>
            <li>I found this product first at a local health store.</li>
            <li>It is refreshing for my face especially after I wash my face and the skin feels tight.  </li>
            <li>my skin is soft and stays soft.</li>
            <li>I was one of those &#x27;kids&#x27; that was told I&#x27;d have zits forever,  NEVER use anything that would make your skin soft.  </li>
            <li>And at 62 glorious years old, people I never met before have called me a liar to my face.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a product that was made of natural ingredients and without SPF.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for several years now, and like it very well.  </li>
            <li>would have loved it especially for the price, but my face only gets worse with use</li>
            <li>Very light and non irritating.</li>
            <li>One order has led to MANY RE-ORDERS ........... never greasy, sinks into little  gasp!  </li>
            <li>I like this moisturiser because it us light and a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I am so surprised that such a luxurious lotion soaks in my skin and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.  </li>
            <li>The first one I thought was perhaps because I kept it in my humid bathroom, but the other two were kept in my bedroom and they mildewed as well after only being opened a month or so.</li>

            <li> I am almost out of this cream and I have used it for almost a year. I love this cream because it is non greasy- goes great under makeup- my skin is soft and stays soft. The price is also great for all three jars and they are generous amounts in each jar. I will order more when this cream comes available again. You can not go wrong with this product.  Lynda A</li>

            <li> This is best facial moisturizer I have found for the money.  The Dessert Essence is a quality line of products. Amazon is much cheaper than the Whole Foods price.</li>
            <li> I have been using an expensive organic lotion that I had been introduced to at a local spa, but just couldn&#x27;t afford to continue purchasing it.  My skin breaks out and or/gets red and extra oily with most store products, so I figured I&#x27;d give this a try.  I am so surprised that such a luxurious lotion soaks in my skin and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.  My face feels so soft, too!

The drying and redness that she was suffering from due to the chemicals in ProActive have gone away, and now she just has a beautiful, even skin tone!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. I have used it for years and always regret when I have tried other moisturizers. There is nothing out there that provides such moisture while preventing wrinkles. Yes, my secret weapon. And the main reason I am hooked is that the company does not partake in animal testing.</li>
            <li> Have been using this more natural alternative for a couple years now.  Paid more at Whole Foods than we do here.  I am sensitive to fragrance and this is mild enough that it doesn&#x27;t cause a problem.  It also doesn&#x27;t smart if it gets into my eyes accidentally.</li>
            <li> Very light and non irritating.</li>
            <li> This product gave me an allergic reaction. My face felt as if it was on fire! Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this product but it smells funky! Definitely not buying this again. I can&#x27;t tell either if it works well on my face, beacuse I can&#x27;t get over the smell.</li>
            <li> I always try to buy organic/natural products before looking at anything else.  Desert Essence is silky smooth, and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.  My only issue is that it&#x27;s not as thick as I like during the winter months in New England, a time when my skin can get very dry.  But this price is so good, and that&#x27;s just for winter... I supplement with heavy duty organic argan oil on the dry spots and my skin&#x27;s happy.  Really, this is such a wonderful price... I was amazed after shopping around.  I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works really well, not irritating, and not greasy at all. a little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several years now, and like it very well.  I&#x27;m a senior, and this makes my skin feel good whenever I put it on.</li>
            <li> Seems just as nice as lotion that costs 3-4x more at the spa.  Reasonably safe ingredient list according to the EWG Skin Deep database.  I don&#x27;t get any particular smell from the product so I&#x27;m not sure what the \\&quot;smelly\\&quot; reviewer is talking about.  It leaves my face smooth and soft but not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I found this product first at a local health store. When I saw the deal for three jars I purchased right away. This face cream hydrates, does not leave your face greasy, and keeps your skin firm. I use it night and morning and sometimes on my elbows when they get super dry. It is a great face cream for sensitive skin or for people who want a simple natural product.</li>
            <li> What can I say? I use this, the mouthwash, the facewash, and the deodorant. This is a great face cream! It&#x27;s kind of thick without feeling greasy or like your pores are clogged. It is lightly scented, and is white. As soon as I apply it, the aloe vera diminishes any redness or irritation, and the jojoba oil moisturizes without causing my skin to break out. My housemate can&#x27;t believe how polished my face looks when I use this. I apply in the morning, then use some more around the eyes before bed. Get it!!!</li>
            <li> Bought 3 containers of this lotion I liked it until they mildewed.  The first one I thought was perhaps because I kept it in my humid bathroom, but the other two were kept in my bedroom and they mildewed as well after only being opened a month or so.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first jar on special at Whole Foods. It was a great price and a nice sized jar. However, the product is not good for my skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and, in the last few weeks, I&#x27;ve had a horrible rash that burns like my face is on fire. I could not figure out what it was until I used some of the moisturizer tonight (to soothe the rash.  After a minute or so, my face started to break out in a bright red rash and my skin was on fire.  I immediately washed it off and applied an ice pack.  It still is inflamed but not stinging anymore.  After research, I realized that it contains sodium hydroxide (or lye) which is extremely caustic.  I don&#x27;t know what the manufacturers were thinking!</li>
            <li> I use it as a daily moisturizer for my face and I like it. I have used Avalon organics in the past and they are slightly exensive as compared to this one.</li>
            <li> I like this moisturiser because it us light and a little bit goes a long way.  It is refreshing for my face especially after I wash my face and the skin feels tight.  Once I apply it, my skin feels much better. The jar will last a long time.</li>
            <li> As a facial moisturizer it&#x27;s not good...my face broke out within a few days of using it...I might be able to use it as a body moisturizer, but not what I had intended purchasing it for...disappointed!</li>
