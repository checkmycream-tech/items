            <li> I have used this Grey Flannel in the past and I continue to be very satisfied. I think it ranks with some of the more expensive colognes...but that&#x27;s just me..*)</li>
            <li> It is a great product and all the males in the family likes it.  I strongly recommend it to everybody.</li>
            <li> A complete blast from the past. I remember my first bottle, had it when I joined the military. Just on a whim I picked up a bottle of the EDT recently ( some 20+ years later) and hoped it would not end up being some regrettable choice....like English Leather, or BRUT!&lt;br /&gt;Just a little dab was enough to do my part in keeping the airspace a bit nicer on those tightly packed tin cans we call aircraft. It will blend nicely into a formulation of your own body chemistry and as far as I can tell won&#x27;t turn noses away. I had a couple of compliments and inquiries of what it was. Definitely one of the choices I&#x27;ve made that ended up on the up side of the experience meter. Give it a try, or reacquaint!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to give this cologne 5 stars but it&#x27;s too strong for me I read that it was what Van Der Hagen used as their scent in their shave soaps which I love, maybe I can figure how to tone it down some.It also came with a cool grey flannel bag , nicely made too.I purchased the large size because of the scent the soaps have.

            <li> love it - very elegant scent</li>
