    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great price!!</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s perfect if you wear glasses (I often do).  </li>
            <li>Awesome.</li>
            <li>Works great for washing my face, and when I sleep with it on, I have no discomfort.</li>
            <li>Love these head bands don&#x27;t have to worry about them breaking after you wear them a couple of times!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my own fault, I should have read the shipping details to see that it came from China.</li>
            <li>I take it with me everywhere, slips nicely into my purse.  </li>
            <li>Works good and comfortable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great but very pricey for the quality of the product.  </li>
            <li>Had a similar one before that was awesome</li>
            <li>My hair is curly, and this keeps it back great!  </li>
            <li>so one can push it in or out to make it more comfy on the head.</li>
            <li>Best way to hold back fine hair</li>
            <li>It is probably more sturdy with thicker hair as fine hair like mine will hold it, but can slip out easy&lt;</li>
            <li>Cheap knock off.</li>
            <li>The dang thing didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that is comfortable to wear.  </li>
            <li>I am glad Amazon.com has so much selection.</li>
            <li>It seemed really strong when I first used it, but I noticed it seems to get bendy.</li>
            <li>Luckily I found Rosallini&#x27;s Metal Teeth Comb Hairband.</li>
            <li>It did arrive quickly however.</li>
            <li>I plan to place an order for several more soon!</li>
            <li>I would give a higher rating but the hair band doesn&#x27;t fit right.  </li>
            <li>It did take awhile to come in the mail, but it was worth the wait.  </li>
            <li>There is a Japanese hair accessory manufacturer that has this design down perfectly....</li>
            <li>I like how the teeth fill the entire band which is great for pulling your hair back.</li>
            <li>It is basic and easy to put on.  </li>
            <li>holds hair great but gives you a headache after a while from the pressure behind the ears.</li>
            <li>working very well.</li>
            <li>It holds its shape very well.</li>
            <li>It does feel even more comfortable, oddly, but it also feels less secure somehow.</li>
            <li>but if you have a small skull like myself,it will fit just fine.</li>
            <li>Other hairbands push on your glasses, or your glasses get in the way of the hairband fitting properly.  </li>
            <li>I like this band because it holds my fine and very straight hair back and gives it a little lift and definition.  </li>
            <li>Smaller than I expected and cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I wish it could longer to hold my hair near my ear areas.</li>
            <li>Somewhat bent up upon arrival but easily fixed.</li>
            <li>Keeps slipping right out of my hair and getting stuck</li>
            <li>it is not what the picture shows at all, the teeth does not cover the whole band, just in the mid section, which I can buy it anywhere locally</li>
            <li>the teeth work good, but they are a little short for thin hair to stick in very well.</li>
            <li>Still works fine for my thick Asian hair, but just remember it might not hold up forever.</li>
            <li>Big enough for a 5year old.</li>
            <li>I am of Scottish decent and have lots of thick hair &amp; a ranger large head.</li>

            <li> Having come regular snail main in a little plastic bag, all the teeth were bent...</li>
            <li> some of my bangs fallen out, obviously, but they had been in it for so long that they stood back anyways and still never touched my face.</li>
            <li> This head band was too rigid, too long and the teeth were too short.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of coming my bangs back with this however it does not fit around your whole head and gives you a headache by the end of the day sharp edges and would not recommend all in all</li>
            <li> The only draw back is a little too short.</li>
            <li> It does take a long while to get it shipped and arrived.</li>
            <li> I have never had a headache or neck pain after wearing for long periods of time and sometimes I have even fallen asleep with it on and never even noticed.</li>
            <li> Too small for me, gave to friend for her young daughter....</li>
            <li> I went through dozens of other hairbands before finding this one.  </li>
            <li> It is not heavy and it is not too tight (at least for me)  </li>
            <li> A little tight, but it holds well</li>
            <li> and when it did it was in a little plastic bag.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically round but does not allow you to bend or shape it to conform to your hair/head.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Too small.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note: The size of the headband looks as if it&#x27;s made for a small child.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wrong product, different with the picture</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time finding hairbands like this (metal) in the stores-</li>
            <li> A lot of the prongs came twisted and bent.</li>
            <li> Essentially it&#x27;s useless to me.  </li>
            <li> I am heart broken!  </li>
            <li> I lost my comb hairband and tried desperately to buy a replacement.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY unless you want to be disappointed.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s great but very pricey for the quality of the product.  I would think twice before buying.</li>
            <li> Too small. Dont buy. If I could give it no stars I would</li>
            <li> I had something similar to this along time ago, but it broke. I like how the teeth fill the entire band which is great for pulling your hair back. I fell asleep with this on and did not experience any problems. It is probably more sturdy with thicker hair as fine hair like mine will hold it, but can slip out easy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note: The size of the headband looks as if it&#x27;s made for a small child. but if you have a small skull like myself,it will fit just fine.</li>

            <li> Best way to hold back fine hair</li>
            <li> Big enough for a 5year old. Not well constructed. Definately did not meet expectations. Had a similar one before that was awesome</li>
            <li> Works good and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to keep my bangs out of my face while I wash my face and while I sleep. Works great for washing my face, and when I sleep with it on, I have no discomfort. I wake up with some of my bangs fallen out, obviously, but they had been in it for so long that they stood back anyways and still never touched my face. It seemed really strong when I first used it, but I noticed it seems to get bendy. It does feel even more comfortable, oddly, but it also feels less secure somehow. Still works fine for my thick Asian hair, but just remember it might not hold up forever.</li>
            <li> I lost my comb hairband and tried desperately to buy a replacement. Luckily I found Rosallini&#x27;s Metal Teeth Comb Hairband. It does not look obvious in hair but it helps keeping my hair in place, especially when I do sports. I am glad Amazon.com has so much selection.</li>
            <li> Love these head bands don&#x27;t have to worry about them breaking after you wear them a couple of times! Great price!!</li>
            <li> These things blow. A lot of the prongs came twisted and bent. It feels like a bunch of copper wire. I would not recommend any buy this product. It did arrive quickly however. I guess that deserves 2 stars.</li>
            <li> Keeps slipping right out of my hair and getting stuck</li>
            <li> working very well. The only draw back is a little too short. I wish it could longer to hold my hair near my ear areas.</li>
            <li> A little tight, but it holds well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wrong product, different with the picture</li>
            <li> I would give a higher rating but the hair band doesn&#x27;t fit right.  It&#x27;s basically round but does not allow you to bend or shape it to conform to your hair/head. Essentially it&#x27;s useless to me.  It&#x27;s a shame because it appears to be well made otherwise.</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews that indicated this hairband was small, and thought the same when I first looked at it.  However, it&#x27;s perfect if you wear glasses (I often do).  Other hairbands push on your glasses, or your glasses get in the way of the hairband fitting properly.  My hair is curly, and this keeps it back great!  I went through dozens of other hairbands before finding this one.  It holds its shape very well.</li>
            <li> Cheap knock off. There is a Japanese hair accessory manufacturer that has this design down perfectly.... they used to be sold in drugstores throughout Honolulu, but recently have disappeared from the shelves. I bought this one hoping to find the Japanese product online.... but this wasn&#x27;t close. This head band was too rigid, too long and the teeth were too short. DO NOT BUY unless you want to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected and cheaply made. Would not order them again</li>
            <li> The headband was just as it was advertised. It is a bit flexible so one can push it in or out to make it more comfy on the head. the teeth work good, but they are a little short for thin hair to stick in very well. they are close together, so that helps.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money. It&#x27;s my own fault, I should have read the shipping details to see that it came from China. It took forever to get here and when it did it was in a little plastic bag. Having come regular snail main in a little plastic bag, all the teeth were bent... It&#x27;s also tiny. I am of Scottish decent and have lots of thick hair &amp; a ranger large head. The dang thing didn&#x27;t fit. It&#x27;s now in the trash....</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time finding hairbands like this (metal) in the stores- they are the only ones that actuallly increase the height of my hair by pulling up the sides. Only metal would have the ability to stay in place too-</li>
            <li> I like the idea of coming my bangs back with this however it does not fit around your whole head and gives you a headache by the end of the day sharp edges and would not recommend all in all</li>
            <li> Awesome. Somewhat bent up upon arrival but easily fixed. Holds hair all day</li>
            <li> It is basic and easy to put on.  It does take a long while to get it shipped and arrived.</li>
            <li> Bought this headband several weeks ago....It did take awhile to come in the mail, but it was worth the wait.  I like this band because it holds my fine and very straight hair back and gives it a little lift and definition.  I also like the fact that is comfortable to wear.  It is not heavy and it is not too tight (at least for me)  I have never had a headache or neck pain after wearing for long periods of time and sometimes I have even fallen asleep with it on and never even noticed. I take it with me everywhere, slips nicely into my purse.  As a matter of fact I recently took on vacation and lost it!  I am heart broken!  I plan to place an order for several more soon!</li>
