            <li>goes in the skin easy,</li>
            <li>but it still works fine.</li>
            <li>It came out great and the tattoo went on nice and dark which is just the way my friend wanted it.</li>
            <li>,if you do good black and greys then I think this ink is good for you.i will be odering this ink again.good product</li>
            <li>Inow have several tattoos with this ink and am very pleased with it!</li>
            <li>I bought these for a friend of mine to help out with his tattoo business,he was really surprised &amp; loved that I did this for him.</li>
            <li>im sure this ink is good for some things.like grey wash.but its like water.so</li>
            <li>I think it was Ur batch because mine is good consistency nice dark lines with one pass</li>
            <li>I wouldnt call it grey wash,but its a great 1st ink for layered shading.</li>
            <li>The ink is good, but my last 2 orders never made it.</li>
            <li>Once the ink finally came it was really good ink c:</li>
            <li>but not a bad ink or buy</li>
            <li>the only thing is i wish it had an expiration date on it, the bottle only say once opened best quality in the year.</li>
            <li>I used this product for the very first time</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t go in easy and doesn&#x27;t show up very well...waste of money...</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve had blacker kuro sumi is my first choice always!</li>
            <li>This ink is not the best for outlining because it smudges way to much and is hard to wipe off.</li>
            <li>worth buying and haveing for your owen collection</li>
            <li>well worth the money</li>
            <li>works great though and still black and hasnt turned blue like most blacks i have bought before .</li>
            <li>but its really good for shading its not as dark as the discription says</li>
            <li>She hasn&#x27;t gotten it yet but am sure she will be glad to get this large bottle of black ink.</li>
            <li>It would probably work better for solid fill ins rather than outlining.</li>
            <li>and I personally like Kuro Sumi Ink much better.</li>
            <li>First off, I had to get another squeeze bottle to pour this in because it doesn&#x27;t come out of the bottle...</li>
            <li>Will definately purchase more when I run low!</li>
            <li>This is a really good black!</li>
            <li>Pretty decent ink.</li>
            <li>This ink is nice and dark!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The ink lays and heals up very well.</li>
            <li>Straight garbage.</li>
            <li>Other than not being as dark as I would like the product works great.</li>
            <li>it makes the tattoos dark and comes out really clean after they heal they still look fresh</li>
            <li>This is real good ink I haven&#x27;t seen or heard anything bad yet.</li>
            <li>as far as the ink it works the bottle had ink all over it it came fast</li>
            <li>He is leaving the top off for a few hours to let some of the water evaporate from the ink before sterilization hoping that will help.</li>
            <li>my tat turned out great very dark black...</li>
            <li>this ink packs a nice deep black line.</li>
            <li>my bottle of ink was a little thicker then my other black ink it works good for me goes on nice and dark</li>
            <li>its a little thin but does a great job.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great but just a little thin</li>
            <li>I am planning on ordering all the colored inks you have here in the near future.</li>
            <li>The only black ink ill use and ive ben tattooing for 19 yrs hands down best ink</li>
            <li>I agree with the others just black water its my first and last purchase.</li>
            <li>He used it on me and him first before trying on a few customers .</li>
            <li>but over all i was not a fan of the ink very watered down.</li>

            <li> little hesitant to use it.</li>
            <li> i saw the previous reviews about it being watered down, your wrong stop trying to make grey wash with it then blaming the ink.</li>

            <li> Obviously used for tattoos; this was a great buy-great value &amp; price!  Grandson was very pleased with it &amp; cont&#x27; to use.</li>
            <li> after trying 2 different brands  this is the best  thanks for the  great shipping and having a great product. I am planning on ordering all the colored inks you have here in the near future.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the very first time and I personally like Kuro Sumi Ink much better. This one just didn&#x27;t to skin well at all.</li>
            <li> i saw the previous reviews about it being watered down, your wrong stop trying to make grey wash with it then blaming the ink. this ink packs a nice deep black line. ive done numerous blacked out eyes with this ink it stays black hasnt faded, havent had one complaint about it even seeming like parts of there skin took it differently. this ink is awesome and its a big bottle that lasts awhile.</li>
            <li> DO NOT USE! First off, I had to get another squeeze bottle to pour this in because it doesn&#x27;t come out of the bottle...the twist cap broke the second time I tried opening it (but still no ink coming out of the tip). It doesn&#x27;t go in easy and doesn&#x27;t show up very well...waste of money...</li>
            <li> HUbby does tattoos and I bought this for him to try out since his stuff is expensive. He used it on me and him first before trying on a few customers . this ink is a little thin for his liking . works great though and still black and hasnt turned blue like most blacks i have bought before .</li>
            <li> ink did the trick went in skin very good my tat turned out great very dark black... thx again  peace</li>
            <li> whoo. excelent  thank you</li>
            <li> Dont buy this ink its garbage&#x27;, if your a tattoo artist youll know why its junk ink.</li>
            <li> This ink is nice and dark! Inow have several tattoos with this ink and am very pleased with it! Will definately purchase more when I run low!</li>
            <li> When I got the ink. The bottle came with no labels on it. little hesitant to use it.</li>
            <li> one star because the offer was for 2 silicon alone made ​​me sending one</li>
            <li> I ran a tattoo on my self a few days ago and no change still as black as when it dripped out the bottle. Good value for great quality.</li>
            <li> I bought these for a friend of mine to help out with his tattoo business,he was really surprised &amp; loved that I did this for him.</li>
