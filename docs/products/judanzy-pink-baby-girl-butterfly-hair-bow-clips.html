            <li>It&#x27;s a perfect size, not to small and not to large.</li>
            <li>Have an 11month old with very fine hair.</li>
            <li>The clips are very sturdy and easy to put in the hair.</li>
            <li>The clips are straight and covered in fabric which makes them slide out easily.</li>
            <li>My teenage daughter loved them so much she took one to wear.</li>

            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They were very cute.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I bought these for my toddler and I love them. They are nice quality and look so cute. My teenage daughter loved them so much she took one to wear.</li>
            <li> I bought these hairbows for my granddaughter that is 2 years old.  They are very cute and very well made.  I am extemely pleased with this purchase and recommend them.</li>
            <li> Just got these for my new daughter and I can&#x27;t wait until she gets enough hair to use them.  Tried them out on older daughter and they stayed in hair nicely.</li>
            <li> Have an 11month old with very fine hair. Nothing stays in her hair - not because she pulls it out. They are very cute but did not stay in her fine hair. Plus they are too big for an 11 month old&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> Love these and would buy again if needed!</li>
            <li> I ordered these cute butterfly hair bow clips for both my 7 year old and 2 year old granddaughters and they both loved them!  They are really cute with full and side ponytails. The clips are very sturdy and easy to put in the hair. Really like these bows!  I&#x27;d like to see them in different styles and colors, such as ladybug bows! Would buy them in a flash.</li>
            <li> Decent quality and so pretty. My opinion more decoration that meant to hold up hair. The clips are straight and covered in fabric which makes them slide out easily. Cute to clip on to a ponytail that&#x27;s held together by a hairband!</li>
            <li> When I placed the order, I thought I was buying 2 bow clips but I ended up receiving 4. I wish they had this in other colors, I would buy every single color there is. Seller please consider making these in other pretty colors. My baby gets lots of compliments when she wears them. I have so many bows for my little girl, but these are my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li> This beautiful butterfly hair clip is very adorable and cute. It&#x27;s a perfect size, not to small and not to large. I love it!!! I would recommend this to all the mother of a baby girl or mother of a little girl out there. You won&#x27;t regret it at all.</li>
            <li> Love this clips!! My two year old loves to wear them, has only gone through two pair since she turned 2 and she&#x27;ll be three at the end of this month. They don&#x27;t fall out!! Only had to replace them when she through a fit and pulled one out and we lost it.</li>
            <li> Well made and adorable!  Even nicer than I expected. Would buy them again if I had more granddaughters. Try them.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and the metal clips are good quality.</li>
            <li> I love these clips - they are absolutely adorable, and they appear just as well made as much more expensive ones I have seen.  A great find.  I&#x27;ll probably order others from this line.</li>
            <li> Beautiful but ribbon came off the clip after  my daughter wore it twice.</li>
            <li> Very well made. The cheering you hear is from my granddaughter.&lt;br /&gt;They were very cute.&lt;br /&gt; Now what to get my grandson?</li>
            <li> i purchased these clips for my 1 yr old daughter.  they are adorable but i noticed the curl in the center came off i saw hers chewing something pink…. i got concerned because it could be a choking hazard</li>
            <li> Really cute and well made love them in my grand daughters hair! I thought they would be too big but they are perfect! : )</li>

            <li> Got these for my 7 month old daughters hair-they were borderline annoyingly adorable.  Because we could not walk 5 feet in public without someone stopping us and commenting on how cute our little angel was-my cherub is beautiful don&#x27;t get me wrong, but with this bow on she is heart stopping!</li>
            <li> I use one for headbands as my baby is a newborn and then as she gets older, I will use two as pictured. Very cute and love that it is not &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34;- Beautifully made.</li>
