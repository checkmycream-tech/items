            <li>This is a pretty good inexpensive conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my hair super silky, but it does a pretty good job of detaining my hair and moisturizing it.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s sulfate free</li>
            <li>This keeps my hair smooth, yet bouncy</li>
            <li>AND it&#x27;s sulfate free.  </li>
            <li>sulfate free is your friend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 50 years old and my hair has NEVER LOOKED THIS GOOD.  </li>
            <li>These are just great, they are cheap in comparison to other products, and my hair has never looked so shiny, manageable, and healthy.</li>
            <li>My super-fine 3b curly hair absolutely loves this stuff!!!  </li>
            <li>so it feels very economical too.</li>
            <li>mild pleasant smell,leaves my long hair curly,soft and smelling nice,really easy to manage also fuller which is pretty nice although I do have a full head of hair</li>

            <li>Great for my curly, dry hair.</li>
            <li>I read up on curly hair and found it has special needs.</li>
            <li>The shampoo has an almost ferret-like sickly sweet smell, and the conditioner is musky.</li>
            <li>I get lots of compliments on how shiny and full it looks.</li>
            <li>Everything is great but the aroma is a little to strong.  </li>
            <li>Smells good also, not strong or overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Not only does this smell amazing, it detangles my hair before I even comb it.</li>
            <li>I started using the shampoo and conditioner, and noticed right away my hair was softer and easier to work with.</li>
            <li>I am reviewing right now the shipping and the product itself.</li>
            <li>I have full frizzy hair and this conditioner really helps.</li>
            <li>Smells so good, detangles hair quickly and hair is less frizzy with evercurl products, would recommend the whole line.</li>
            <li>then you will know what I mean when I say the Hydracharge Conditioner is better as one of the kind you apply to</li>
            <li>Very thick and rich formula that works great on frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is very nice, it makes my fine hair feel clean but not stripped of all the moisture and a little goes a long way will definitely buy more</li>
            <li>Thick, rich and creamy, it moisturizes and prevents frizz fairly well.</li>
            <li>purchased the shampoo first now added the conditioner.....</li>
            <li>I love it and will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>I also recommend Pure Shine Curls Lotion right after your shower.</li>
            <li>It is inexpensive but works really well!</li>
            <li>my hai soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I just use a large blob in the palm and rub hands together and rub throughout my hair.</li>
            <li>not very dry.you will love it curly haired women.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really really hydrating.  </li>
            <li>A hairdresser mentioned that shampoo and conditioner really matters.  </li>
            <li>It was shipped really fast and on time.</li>
            <li>My hair is very curly...</li>
            <li>All I can say is that Loreal got it right when she created this line, My hair is soft and silky</li>
            <li>It definitely manages frizz and leaves my hair much softer than most other conditioners.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to try out a new brand.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s hard to manage, this could save so much time and so many headaches.  </li>
            <li>It was a huge upgrade for my hair from the much more expensive Aveda brand.</li>
            <li>I completely adore this product line!</li>
            <li>Soft, shiny hair!  </li>
            <li>This conditioner has been great for my half wavy, half curly dry hair.</li>
            <li>hair came back from chemo really soft and curly and these product work very well</li>
            <li>I use this conditioner, my curls are not frizzy, they are so soft and bouncy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It also leaves my hair really soft.  </li>
            <li>Recently started using this Conditioner with my very curly hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>SOFT  </li>
            <li>but wow has it saved me a ton of money.</li>
            <li>along with a sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>My naturally wavy hair soaks this up</li>
            <li>Makes curls soft &amp; defined</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair</li>
            <li>I was looking to get a new shampoo &amp; conditioner for my newly permed hair and it causes me massive chunk of hair loss -</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and have spent a ton of money over the years trying to find the right shampoo / conditioner that won&#x27;t dry out my hair.</li>
            <li>but more like any other conditioner, not very special though.</li>
            <li>Why does it smell like chemicals if it&#x27;s suppose to be free of most of those things that are bad for your hair?</li>
            <li>my only complaint is why can&#x27;t there be more product in the bottles.</li>
            <li>Left my hair flat and over conditioned to the point where it didn&#x27;t much curl....</li>
            <li>I have somewhat coarse curly hair and while this did make my hair soft, it did nothing for the curls.</li>
            <li>No different from Garnier Fructis or any other household cheap brand - did not significantly or otherwise insignificantly revitalize my hair.</li>
            <li>I have dry, fine, thick wavy hair.</li>

            <li> only downside to both the shampoo and the conditioner (and the only major differences I have found to the Paul Mitchell Curls line) are the fragrances of the L&#x27;Oreal versions - they are not good.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal EverCurl Hydracharge Shampoo and Conditioner work as well on my mid-back-length loose corkscrew curls as the Paul Mitchell Curl Shampoo and Leave-in Conditioner at cleaning, conditioning, hydrating, detangling, and frizz reduction.</li>
            <li> It is mega thick though so you might have to experiment and add a little water to it first.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and curly and this has been a savior!</li>
            <li> the product does keep my curls but the only thing I don&#x27;t like is that my hair feels a little sticky after using it...</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Though my hair usually retains fragrances, these two do not seem to last over the styling cream I put in post-shower, so I will continue to order them, though I hope L&#x27;Oreal might change fragrances sometime soon.</li>
            <li> Just have to put some other hair products in to mask the chemical smell.</li>
            <li> My sister has extremely curly (think ringlets) hair</li>
            <li> My hair does not need to be trimmed as often, due to fewer breakages and fewer split ends.  </li>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to detangle as well as other conditioners.</li>
            <li> A little shampoo, about 5 mins conditioning, wide tooth comb, lotion.</li>
            <li> It leaves the hair feeling mositurised w/o feeling greasy or weighed down.</li>
            <li> Maintains body, doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair or leave it feeling oily.</li>
            <li> Hair is fuller and less frizzy.</li>

            <li> My daughter has curly hair, and this is my favorite shampoo/conditioner for her. I love the smell, it works well, and I love that it is sulfate-free!</li>
            <li> I love this product to cowash with. It leaves the hair feeling mositurised w/o feeling greasy or weighed down. ❤❤❤❤❤ I never wanna run out of this stuff. Smells good also, not strong or overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Bottle lasted about a month. I have dry, fine, thick wavy hair. I found this product dried out my hair.  The product did however help better define my curls but it also did add weight to my hair.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal EverCurl Hydracharge Shampoo and Conditioner work as well on my mid-back-length loose corkscrew curls as the Paul Mitchell Curl Shampoo and Leave-in Conditioner at cleaning, conditioning, hydrating, detangling, and frizz reduction. It is a thick conditioner that does not then require a leave-in conditioner in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to both the shampoo and the conditioner (and the only major differences I have found to the Paul Mitchell Curls line) are the fragrances of the L&#x27;Oreal versions - they are not good. The shampoo has an almost ferret-like sickly sweet smell, and the conditioner is musky. Though my hair usually retains fragrances, these two do not seem to last over the styling cream I put in post-shower, so I will continue to order them, though I hope L&#x27;Oreal might change fragrances sometime soon.</li>
            <li> I completely adore this product line! The shampoo that goes with this is incredible ! And this conditioner is just as wonderful ! My frizzy curly hair had definition with zero product in it ! I am so so happy i found this shampoo and conditioner ! Ohhh and it smells flipping awesome !</li>
            <li> Great for my curly, dry hair. I started using the shampoo and conditioner, and noticed right away my hair was softer and easier to work with.</li>
            <li> purchased the shampoo first now added the conditioner.....mild pleasant smell,leaves my long hair curly,soft and smelling nice,really easy to manage also fuller which is pretty nice although I do have a full head of hair not very dry.you will love it curly haired women.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is very nice, it makes my fine hair feel clean but not stripped of all the moisture and a little goes a long way will definitely buy more</li>
            <li> Terrible smell, but I like the shampoo as it is. Just have to put some other hair products in to mask the chemical smell. Why does it smell like chemicals if it&#x27;s suppose to be free of most of those things that are bad for your hair?</li>
            <li> This product is great .  All I can say is that Loreal got it right when she created this line, My hair is soft and silky oh yeah and wavier than before. my only complaint is why can&#x27;t there be more product in the bottles.</li>
            <li> Once I found this conditioner, I have not used anything else. It&#x27;s a little pricey for the quantity but still not obnoxiously expensive.  There is nothing out there that works quite as well.  The smell is wonderful too.&lt;br /&gt;When I use this conditioner, my curls are not frizzy, they are so soft and bouncy.&lt;br /&gt;I have long, thick and curly hair that tends to get very frizzy in the heat and humidity.  This product is perfect for me!</li>
            <li> I like it, but not love it. It doesn&#x27;t just feel as moisturizing as the pink moisturizing conditioner from the same series. I gave it a try, but will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Left my hair flat and over conditioned to the point where it didn&#x27;t much curl.... sad. It has no fragrance at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 50 years old and my hair has NEVER LOOKED THIS GOOD.  I&#x27;ve been using the L&#x27;Oreal Hydracharge shampoo and conditioner for five months now and it just gets better over time.  Get the &amp;#34;leave in&amp;#34; creme for perfection.  I get compliments all the time and I love my hair for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li> Smells great and lightweight formula of good consistency, contains natural ingredients and it&#x27;s sulfate free which makes it less harsh on hair. Not sure if this promotes the formation of curls but as a conditioner it does the job and minimizes frizz.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat coarse curly hair and while this did make my hair soft, it did nothing for the curls.</li>
            <li> this product smells great, leave my hair very smooth and smelling great, i really love it and works great for natural hair</li>
            <li> I have semi-oily wavy hair and the EverCurl line is the best shampoo &amp; conditioner I&#x27;ve used for the price. Hair is fuller and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> No different from Garnier Fructis or any other household cheap brand - did not significantly or otherwise insignificantly revitalize my hair.</li>
            <li> Smells so good, detangles hair quickly and hair is less frizzy with evercurl products, would recommend the whole line. This conditioner has been great for my half wavy, half curly dry hair. Also love the shampoo and leave in cream.</li>
            <li> Very thick and rich formula that works great on frizzy hair.  My sister has extremely curly (think ringlets) hair and she recommended this product to me.  It definitely manages frizz and leaves my hair much softer than most other conditioners.  It was a huge upgrade for my hair from the much more expensive Aveda brand.</li>
            <li> My hair likes it- but only every other day... so I rotate between this and another hair shampoo/conditioner</li>
            <li> This conditioner is amazing.  If you have curly hair that&#x27;s hard to manage, this could save so much time and so many headaches.  I&#x27;ve gone through so many products that either make my hair more frizzy, or flatten my curls.  This keeps my hair smooth, yet bouncy and it&#x27;s really really hydrating.  Usually I use argan oil in my hair after a shower, but with this, I don&#x27;t even need to.  It also leaves my hair really soft.  I love it and will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, great product!</li>
            <li> buying on line is convenient&lt;br /&gt;my hair came back from chemo really soft and curly and these product work very well&lt;br /&gt;O would recommend this product to anyone with hair</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner have been my favorite ever compared to every salon curling s&amp;c!!! It works for months of continuous use without the need for switching to others.  My super-fine 3b curly hair absolutely loves this stuff!!!  My hair does not need to be trimmed as often, due to fewer breakages and fewer split ends.  Great when you are growing your hair out or wanting more defined, no-friz curls.  I&#x27;ll use only these products as long as they continue to make it.</li>
            <li> Recently started using this Conditioner with my very curly hair. It leaves my hair soft and manageable. I am been pleased at the improved condition of my hair. It seems to have helped tame the frizz and improved the health of my  curls.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful sulfate free conditioner for those of us with curly hair. It helps keep the curls instead of tangles.</li>
            <li> I truly love this stuff. I have extremely curly hair. I kept it very short since i had my children.At 62I needed a total knee replacement and decided i would let my hair grow. What a job.  The frizzys were awful. I read up on curly hair and found it has special needs.I have not used a shampoo on it since march.Thats seven months. Curly hair doesnt need it. I just use a large blob in the palm and rub hands together and rub throughout my hair. Just use finger and go fron scalp to ends. I f you need more for ends use it. Wait a few min and rinse well.SOFT  Donot rub your hair dry with a terry towels. Get a microfiber towel. Dont rub just squeeze.</li>
            <li> best stuff on the market for curly soft hair</li>
            <li> I love this line. I only use the shampoo and conditioner but wow has it saved me a ton of money. I have super thick, wavy, down to my waist hair.... along with a sensitive scalp. So, for YEARS I only used Bumble &amp; Bumble.... Which runs at like $30 for a bottle this size. I wouldn&#x27;t say that this product is AS good as Bumble  &amp; Bumble for one reason: you need a lot of it to get through your hair. But, at the price you can afford that :)</li>
            <li> Finally, s conditioner that my hair, my wallet &amp; me can agree on!!! My naturally wavy hair soaks this up &amp; I no longer have&amp;#34;poodle&amp;#34; hair!</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and have spent a ton of money over the years trying to find the right shampoo / conditioner that won&#x27;t dry out my hair. I love love love the no sulfate line of L&#x27;Oreal hair products, especially the EverCurl line. These are just great, they are cheap in comparison to other products, and my hair has never looked so shiny, manageable, and healthy. So happy!</li>
            <li> Soft, shiny hair!  I waited weeks to post this.  A hairdresser mentioned that shampoo and conditioner really matters.  Hair prone to frizz needs this kind of shampoo and conditioner and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  A little goes a long way so it feels very economical too.</li>
            <li> Absolutely my favorite conditioner AND it&#x27;s sulfate free.  You need a small amount and it works wonders.  Maintains body, doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair or leave it feeling oily.</li>
            <li> It was shipped really fast and on time. I like this product because is 100% vegan, doesn&#x27;t have parabens, sulfates or silicones. I recommend to anyone who is starting lo/no poo. I am reviewing right now the shipping and the product itself. I didn&#x27;t start to use yet, but as soon as I use I&#x27;ll post another review about the effect on my hair.</li>
            <li> Hydrates my ringlets beautifully. Love the shampoo as well :) sulfate free is your friend. I also recommend Pure Shine Curls Lotion right after your shower. That&#x27;s all you need. A little shampoo, about 5 mins conditioning, wide tooth comb, lotion. DON&#x27;T TOUCH UNTIL DRY. Look up 10 commandments for curly hair. You&#x27;re welcome.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizing conditioner for my wavy hair. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I have full frizzy hair and this conditioner really helps.</li>
            <li> My daughter with lots of curly hair loves this conditioner. She&#x27;s been using it ever since it was recommended to her by a nice woman we met on a cruise who recommended it to her.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what this does to my hair, it&#x27;s okay but more like any other conditioner, not very special though.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Thick, rich and creamy, it moisturizes and prevents frizz fairly well. It smells delicious and leaves my curls defined and bouncy.</li>
            <li> Adds moisture to dry and color treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this again in the future and will recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! My hair is dry and curly and this has been a savior!</li>
            <li> Everything is great but the aroma is a little to strong.  The condition it leaves my hair in is excellent.</li>
            <li> This conditioner, partnered with the matching shampoo and leave in conditioner, does a wonderful job for my hair.  I get lots of compliments on how shiny and full it looks.</li>
            <li> It is inexpensive but works really well!</li>
            <li> If you have thick and curly hair then you will know what I mean when I say the Hydracharge Conditioner is better as one of the kind you apply to ** dry ** hair and than rinse out. It is mega thick though so you might have to experiment and add a little water to it first.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel healthy and it is one of those you can tell in the shower when you rinse it that it is good. Also have the shampoo and very happy with them. Have emptied them and now going to repurchase.</li>
            <li> Makes curls soft &amp; defined</li>
            <li> not what i was expecting</li>
            <li> Not only does this smell amazing, it detangles my hair before I even comb it. I have 3A/3B type hair. Would recommend to any curlies out there!</li>
            <li> I actually changed my shampoo and conditioner just to see if there would be a difference in my hair.  I wanted to try out a new brand.  I tried out Suave&#x27;s Keratin Infusion Smoothing Shampoo &amp; Conditioner.  I have naturally wavy hair and it is frizzy as well.  My ethnicity is Filipino, Spanish, Chinese, and Hawaiian.  Suave&#x27;s bottle advertised that it prevents frizz...for my hair it did not.  Suave&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner actually dried out my hair.  I dumped Suave&#x27;s bottles and went back to L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Evercurl Hydracharge Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
            <li> I was looking to get a new shampoo &amp; conditioner for my newly permed hair and it causes me massive chunk of hair loss - I hate it !&lt;br /&gt;I would give it a zero star if I could !!!!</li>
            <li> My hair is very curly...the product does keep my curls but the only thing I don&#x27;t like is that my hair feels a little sticky after using it...</li>
            <li> Smells nice, worked ok. Doesn&#x27;t seem to detangle as well as other conditioners.</li>
            <li> allergic to fragrance</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good inexpensive conditioner.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair super silky, but it does a pretty good job of detaining my hair and moisturizing it.  I have thick wavy hair that often has dry ends. I think this is a good inexpensive conditioner that is sulfate free.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite silicone free conditioners it smells amazing leabes my hai soft and smooth.</li>
