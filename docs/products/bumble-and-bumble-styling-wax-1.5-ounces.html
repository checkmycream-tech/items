    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit clayey and needs to be blended with an alcohol based hairspray rubbed in the palm in order to work best.</li>
            <li>Styling wax arrived quickly, perfect condition.</li>
            <li>Best wax on the market.</li>

            <li>This styling wax has been perfect - perfect hold, perfect scent (virtually NONE), and washes out easy.</li>

            <li>If you have fine or oil-prone or weighted-down prone hair, this is just the greatest product</li>
            <li>The item arrived in time and in good condition.</li>
            <li>Without a doubt, this wax is the best I&#x27;ve tried - it gives me smooth shiny not-greasy strands of hair that frame my face</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>I had to return it for this reason, but I&#x27;m sure it is a good product otherwise.</li>
            <li>Bumble and Bumble Styling wax will make your hair look nice and shiny, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re into.</li>
            <li>This stuff gives my hair a healthy shine, keeps it in control and looking good.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair - I have to use volumizing shampoos.  </li>
            <li>Prevents frizz, creates lovely texture.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot Amazon!!!!</li>
            <li>But I used mine today to give it a second try with my own touch and it was great.</li>
            <li>Glad to find it available through Amazon.</li>
            <li>This stuff does the job if you have fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Worked great for my fine, short hair in the rainy weather.  </li>
            <li>Not associated with Bumble and Bumble at all - just a huge huge fan of this product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t advertise itself as fragrance free, and it is not.</li>
            <li>this has been a fantastic product which I will use from now on.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this would be as good as the old John Friedman gold styling wax they discontinued</li>
            <li>Great product for use after using flat iron to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>It really works great with my short, fine hair.</li>
            <li>this one is softer, but it is not a bad product.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy using the styling wax, as it&#x27;s good for adding texture to layered hairstyles, without feeling greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li>I was hopeful this product would be good, as there are so few perfume free products like this out there.</li>

            <li>Although I&#x27;ve rarely been satisfied with the look, I&#x27;ve been trying it off and on for quite some time, and I think I have a little better luck in the winter.</li>
            <li>Great for creating flexible hold and texture for my layered, thick, frizz prone wavy hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the only bumble and bumble product I&#x27;ve ever tried, but I&#x27;ve tried many gels/waxes etc.  </li>
            <li>hair putty for $10 is actually a bit better to me.  </li>
            <li>We tend to have hot summers &gt;98.6° (&gt;37°C) here in Dallas.</li>
            <li>If it came in a larger size, it would be a much better value.</li>
            <li>I am certain I will be buying this product for the next 10 years or more.  </li>
            <li>What a lucky find!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m a regular customer ad write lots of reviews.  </li>
            <li>Not fragrance free, just as stated on the actual label.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have an issue with this product and…it holds my stick straight hair in place.</li>
            <li>I still use it now and then but American Crew Fiber or Davines Pliable Stucco are MUCH better for short men&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;oreal</li>
            <li>although twice as high does not compare...</li>
            <li>and then just a little tiny bit of this was before drying with a diffuser and am very pleased with how it came out.</li>
            <li>Its not stiff or sticky - looks pretty natural.</li>
            <li>I only ordered it in the first place because Amazon was running an instant rebate if you spent a certain amount on hair products, so I needed to find something to bring me over the top.  </li>
            <li>Very soft hold.</li>
            <li>I have a scalp that is very sensitive to products that have alcohol in them.</li>
            <li>special concern for people with hair like mine is that anything can weigh it down or make it appear greasy.  </li>
            <li>It is clearly scented, even list fragrance on the case.  </li>

            <li> it is pretty expensive and is very small (small amount).  </li>
            <li> The wax hold hair in place without that stiff cardboard feeling.</li>
            <li> But it is not a strong perfume</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy with hair 1.5\\&quot; (3.5cm) and usually shorter, and I was looking for something to add a little shine and take away some frizz.</li>
            <li> This product has very little scent, which is my intention in purchasing it.  </li>
            <li> Aside from casual daily use I can get douchy with it &amp; the wax will help my hair strike a pose.</li>
            <li> I have been experimenting for at least 10 years, and have tried every kerastase and bedhead product.</li>
            <li> My stylist thought I was crazy for thinking this product would work and tried it out with me last time I was there</li>
            <li> - stinks to high heaven with fake fragrance.</li>
            <li> It left my hair oily and bendy, very weird.</li>
            <li> I hate having to mess with my hair and am prone to bushy/frizzy hair if it gets even slightly long.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s AWFUL</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Discovered this product while visiting a friend in England.  Worked great for my fine, short hair in the rainy weather.  Doesn&#x27;t do as well for longer hair.  Glad to find it available through Amazon.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my salon and it works great for shaping your hair.  I do spikes.  Its not stiff or sticky - looks pretty natural.</li>
            <li> Great for creating flexible hold and texture for my layered, thick, frizz prone wavy hair. A little bit of this stuff works wonders. I put this in my damp hair before I diffuse to create soft bouncy waves. It also has a very subtle clean smell.</li>
            <li> This product has very little scent, which is my intention in purchasing it.  It&#x27;s a bit clayey and needs to be blended with an alcohol based hairspray rubbed in the palm in order to work best.</li>
            <li> It was advertised as unscented, but when I got it and read the ingredients it listed FRAGRANCE. Anyone who is sensitive or allergic to fragrance do not buy this. I contacted the seller about this and requested that they fragrance to their list of ingredients on the product page. I had to return it for this reason, but I&#x27;m sure it is a good product otherwise.</li>
            <li> Not fragrance free, just as stated on the actual label.  So don&#x27;t believe the reviews that say that it is.  It doesn&#x27;t advertise itself as fragrance free, and it is not.</li>
            <li> Styling wax arrived quickly, perfect condition. Great product for use after using flat iron to straighten my hair. If use in small amounts, hair still feels soft.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an unscented styling product, especially for summertime to keep mosquitoes and bees away. this has been a fantastic product which I will use from now on.</li>
            <li> Best wax on the market. Very soft hold. Prevents frizz, creates lovely texture. Wish I&#x27;d discovered it sooner.</li>
            <li> The item arrived in time and in good condition. I was hopeful this product would be good, as there are so few perfume free products like this out there. Bumble and Bumble Styling wax will make your hair look nice and shiny, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re into. Unfortunately it has almost zero hold, making me think the &#x27;styling wax&#x27; label is pretty misleading. It&#x27;s not cheap at all, so there is no way I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I blow dry my hair, use a curling iron, and then put some wax on my fingertips and place my hair where I want it. The wax hold hair in place without that stiff cardboard feeling. Great product!!</li>
            <li> I hate having to mess with my hair and am prone to bushy/frizzy hair if it gets even slightly long.

Aside from casual daily use I can get douchy with it &amp; the wax will help my hair strike a pose.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair - I have to use volumizing shampoos.  When I was little my mom couldn&#x27;t keep barrettes in my hair, they&#x27;d just slide out .... you know the type?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The special concern for people with hair like mine is that anything can weigh it down or make it appear greasy.  You try to style your hair with product, and suddenly you look like you&#x27;ve got morning after greasy hair.  But not with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only bumble and bumble product I&#x27;ve ever tried, but I&#x27;ve tried many gels/waxes etc.  I have been experimenting for at least 10 years, and have tried every kerastase and bedhead product. Without a doubt, this wax is the best I&#x27;ve tried - it gives me smooth shiny not-greasy strands of hair that frame my face well.  Looks like I&#x27;m not wearing any product at all.  I am certain I will be buying this product for the next 10 years or more.  If you have fine or oil-prone or weighted-down prone hair, this is just the greatest product invented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy.  I only ordered it in the first place because Amazon was running an instant rebate if you spent a certain amount on hair products, so I needed to find something to bring me over the top.  This is the impulsive product I added to my cart.  What a lucky find!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m a regular customer ad write lots of reviews.  Not associated with Bumble and Bumble at all - just a huge huge fan of this product.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair, middle of my back and naturally frizzy. I bought this product after reading some other reviews from people who reported similar hair types. My stylist thought I was crazy for thinking this product would work and tried it out with me last time I was there (after I&#x27;d already ordered the product) and it was gross. It left my hair oily and bendy, very weird. But I used mine today to give it a second try with my own touch and it was great. I used some leave in conditioner and then just a little tiny bit of this was before drying with a diffuser and am very pleased with how it came out. I haven&#x27;t tried it with blowing my hair out or heat styling it, but it works for what I bought it for and that is to hold the wave and reduce frizz. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Arrived as a liquid. Returned it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking it was unscented.  It is clearly scented, even list fragrance on the case.  But it is not a strong perfume so I chose to keep and use it but I was disappointed and will be more careful next time.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using the styling wax, as it&#x27;s good for adding texture to layered hairstyles, without feeling greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to say that it&#x27;s \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; but it stays \\&quot;liquid\\&quot; at body temperature.  I still use it now and then but American Crew Fiber or Davines Pliable Stucco are MUCH better for short men&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;oreal hair putty for $10 is actually a bit better to me.  I don&#x27;t like that I could still ALWAYS feel the tackiness of Bumble and Bumble after an hour or two.</li>
            <li> I have a scalp that is very sensitive to products that have alcohol in them. I don&#x27;t have an issue with this product and…it holds my stick straight hair in place.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time.  It really works great with my short, fine hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy with hair 1.5\\&quot; (3.5cm) and usually shorter, and I was looking for something to add a little shine and take away some frizz. Given that this product melts at body temperature, if it is applied to hair close to the scalp it tends to stay molten and waxy. Although I&#x27;ve rarely been satisfied with the look, I&#x27;ve been trying it off and on for quite some time, and I think I have a little better luck in the winter. We tend to have hot summers &gt;98.6° (&gt;37°C) here in Dallas.</li>
            <li> It is def not like the hair wax i was looking to replace it with.  this one is softer, but it is not a bad product.  lots of people like it, but i was looking for something different i guess.  i will use it, but i wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  It works great, looks great, smells great.  It does not leave any flaky residue.  The downside is...it is pretty expensive and is very small (small amount).  If it came in a larger size, it would be a much better value.</li>
            <li> $89.00 for 1.5 ounces of styling wax !!!!  My favorite product discontinued but I can&#x27;t pay that ridiculous amount.  Thanks a lot Amazon!!!!</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be as good as the old John Friedman gold styling wax they discontinued although twice as high does not compare...</li>
            <li> This stuff does the job if you have fine hair.  It is kind of expensive for what it is, though, and other alternatives exist.</li>
            <li> Does anyone know of a comparable replacement for this discontinued product? I just tried the B&amp;B Sumotech and it&#x27;s AWFUL - stinks to high heaven with fake fragrance. This styling wax has been perfect - perfect hold, perfect scent (virtually NONE), and washes out easy.</li>
            <li> This is the nicest hair wax ivevevervused.  It&#x27;s light, gives great texture, has a faint apple fragrance, washes out easily with water.  Can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough.</li>
