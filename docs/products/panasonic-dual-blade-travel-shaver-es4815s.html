            <li>Shaves just great.    </li>
            <li>Works just great in the shower.  </li>
            <li>my whiskers are SO happy.</li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>I love that I can use rechargable AA batteries and that it will hold a charge for WEEKS!!      </li>
            <li>very handy.  </li>
            <li>This is the best battery operated razor that I have ever purchased...bought two more as gifts</li>
            <li>Given the price, it is a good value in that you are getting a wet/dry, reliable shaver.</li>
            <li>He tried it and said its not that good.</li>
            <li>Good value though.</li>
            <li>good anywhere.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>I was so impressed with the Panasonic ES4815S travel shaver(runs on two AA batteries) that I had to write my first ever review.</li>
            <li>and I love shaving in the shower now!    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this product!  </li>
            <li>Worked even better!  </li>
            <li>Kind of made my face feel oily.     </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what else is nice about this shaver.</li>
            <li>Once I purchased one in the $70 range and liked it</li>
            <li>And it fits my hand so nicely.  </li>
            <li>I liked it.</li>
            <li>It gives very nice and smooth shave.</li>
            <li>This is the best by far to date.</li>
            <li>When on a cruise, for example, when you want to look clean shaven before going to the dining room, then I would use it most days with good effect.</li>
            <li>Although I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, I assume you will get more shaves with 2400 mAh Ni-Mh rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li>It feels weighty in the hand but that gives me a bit more assurance in a way.</li>
            <li>I find it giving a better shave in the shower with the water or gel on.</li>
            <li>I love the size and the shape.  </li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the unit overall as it provides a comfortabe shave, the batterlies have good longevity and the unit is compact, ergonomic, attractive.  </li>
            <li>I gifted this piece to my husband for his Bday.</li>
            <li>As others have suggested, a pop up trimmer (available on rechargable versions) would be a nice addition.</li>
            <li>But does an OK job for traveling.</li>
            <li>key is to use them with shaving gel/foam for best results.</li>
            <li>more could you ask for in a shaver?</li>
            <li>A pleasure to be able to shave on the go and on your way to work.  </li>
            <li>I think this a fair statement, as I slowly began to learn how to best use the shaver over time and my skin also gradually adapted to the machine.  </li>
            <li>Since then I have graduated to using the more advanced Panasonic models over the years.</li>
            <li>It has worked great so far.</li>
            <li>B00007M9SU Braun PocketGo P-70 Men&#x27;s Shaver]] is a good single head travel shaver, but not as good.</li>
            <li>Cleaning it is quite easy.</li>
            <li>I also was looking for a dry/wet shaver and finding one around 30 bucks that I had in mind wasn&#x27;t going to be easy.</li>
            <li>so this electric razor suits me fine.  </li>
            <li>but it is more then adequate for the money you spend.</li>
            <li>free of razorburn.</li>
            <li>Get this discontinued model ES4815s while it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>You can easily wash the razor under tap water which makes it easier to clean.</li>
            <li>I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have left my rechargable panasonic in the hotel, it worked great..</li>
            <li>Cuts close and free of tugging.</li>
            <li>My husband loves the convenience and gets a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>So far giving good battery life too.</li>
            <li>This one pulls my neck hair and isn&#x27;t really all that effective at a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>I was originally looking for an $80-90 wet/shave rechargeable shaver.</li>
            <li>i got very good shaves, tho not as fast as my regular panasonic.  </li>
            <li>and it looks clean.</li>
            <li>tried it in shower, not quite a clean shave, and you still need to look in the mirror to not miss any thing.</li>
            <li>Need to clean after every shave.  </li>
            <li>use it every day or for travel, wet or dry, a great value and a great shave.</li>
            <li>It shaves well, is powerful and actually so easy to clean with liquid hand soap under running water that it&#x27;s fun.  </li>
            <li>I have used it in the shower with lather but doesn&#x27;t really seem to do much better.</li>
            <li>Uses AA batteries, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about replacing the whole shaver like most electrics that start losing their charging ability.</li>
            <li>It has good power and will last for 20+ shaves on just 2 AA alkaline batteries.</li>
            <li>but it is full.</li>
            <li>It not only has surprising power for a batter operated razor, but it&#x27;s versatility as a dry/wet shaver</li>
            <li>It works good as a shaver and the batteries seem to last forever</li>
            <li>The  back-and-forth motion of the dual-head system seems fairly time-consuming, especially on my head.  </li>
            <li>not bad.  </li>
            <li>By me slowing down it gives me a great smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my first set of AA batteries and it&#x27;s still running strong.  </li>
            <li>The shave is satisfactory, the battery life is adequate, and it&#x27;s lighter than the full size Panasonic I had been carrying.</li>
            <li>Gives a good dry shave and wet shave is great too.</li>
            <li>That sold me and I have been a loyal Panasonic user ever since.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had an older model Panasonic wet-dry shaver that I just love.  </li>
            <li>A solid well built , stylish , cute but</li>
            <li>Now that is a nice shaver (when the blades are sharp) but it needs better batteries.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite as powerful as the full size shavers, but it does give a good wet shave.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little razor.</li>
            <li>but now it gives me very close smooth shave )</li>
            <li>The blue touch is nice.</li>
            <li>It is ergonomically better than the older ES805S, although the ES805S is still very ergonomic.</li>
            <li>I bought the right product.    </li>
            <li>It shaves clean, fast, but all rechargeables have built in obsolescence as the battery dies.  </li>
            <li>This leads me to the main reason that I am a true and loyal fan of the Panasonic Wet/Dry shavers.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Pricewise, for $25, there is no other competitor that provides as many features/benefits as the Panasonic ES4815S Pro Curve.</li>
            <li>In all seriousness, this little shaver does a better job than my Braun 9595 costing much more.  </li>
            <li>I bought some NiMH rechargeables and they are working fine so far.    </li>
            <li>But,for my husband,whenevere he use this ,he has to use the normal razor again to have a clean shave.</li>
            <li>They seems to be hard to find, but if you do find one, it makes a great travel shaver.  </li>
            <li>Needless to say, it works great!</li>
            <li>&quot; means exactly that.</li>
            <li>I can only expect even better results when I use it with foam shaving cream or shower gel.</li>
            <li>I, however, found this razor fitting all my criteria above.    </li>
            <li>You will end up using the battery a bit more as you will keep it running under water while cleaning, but that shouldn&#x27;t be a big deal if you have rechargeable AA batteries or the set of 20 from IKEA for 2 bucks!    </li>
            <li>This is the first electric razor I have owned.</li>
            <li>So theoretically I should get more use out of this shaver.</li>
            <li>this shaver couldn&#x27;t cut a baby, it really doesn&#x27;t get the job done even if u give your face the time to adjust, I can&#x27;t say its worth the money</li>
            <li>This is my first wet/dry shaver</li>
            <li>but it was not enough better so returned to the $25-$30 range.</li>
            <li>It has run on the first set of batteries for over a month and is still going.</li>
            <li>I have a top of line Brum shaver, getting this one just for back up and the travel shaver.  </li>
            <li>This is very good wet and dry</li>
            <li>I did get some slight skin burn, but other then that it did excellent work!</li>
            <li>As far as the quality of the shave, it is being okay so far.</li>
            <li>only good things are you can wash it in water, and takes regular batteries.</li>
            <li>My experience with Panasonic ES4815S Pro Curve was a positive one, although every now</li>
            <li>You are strongly urged (as in the manual) to use it for 30 days before arriving at a final opinion and that seems to make sense.</li>
            <li>The instructions said to allow up to 3 weeks for the skin to get used to the new shave, but with only mild discomfort on my face and the back of my neck the first shave, afterwards has been very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>&quot; Why else buy a shaver that is \\&quot;wet\\&quot; capable?</li>
            <li>I get very smooth/close shaves with shower gel.</li>
            <li>This two head shaver gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li>With modern, no memory, NIMH batteries and charger</li>
            <li>I do not have a very dense beard</li>
            <li>and I had to replace the whole shaver.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this shaver.  </li>
            <li>It is not the cleanest shave but its very close.</li>
            <li>and it performs better than expected.  </li>
            <li>The replacement batteries cost as much as the battery powered shaver.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic ES48155 Pro Curve Compact Shaver has really delivered.  </li>
            <li>It cuts well, doesn&#x27;t pull, and is really waterproof.  </li>
            <li>I bought this shaver for the road trip did not expecting much.</li>
            <li>but here I get a really non-figuritivly close shave.  </li>
            <li>I use it in the shower with just shampoo on my head as a lubricant (I use regular shaving cream on my face) and I am amazed at just how smooth a shave I get.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li>After using this about 10 times I&#x27;m ready to throw it away.</li>
            <li>far the ES4815 has been like every Panasonic wet/dry shaver I&#x27;ve owned; economical, reliable, and durable.   </li>
            <li>Most of you are probably too young to remember, but Panasonic introduced the first wet/dry shaver as a single foil shaver named \\&quot;Mr.</li>
            <li>You can ONLY \\&quot;rinse\\&quot; the shaver clean under water.</li>
            <li>Cutters run a lot faster than my last two Panasonics and that helps to minimize any tugging and helps with a clean shave.</li>
            <li>Maybe,its good for daily use or less hair.</li>
            <li>Overall I can say,its OK only.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;curve\\&quot; makes it a little more maneuverable.</li>
            <li>, this little inexpensive non-rechargable works vastly better.  </li>
            <li>The ES4815s does not have the power or size of the normally used electric but works almost well.       </li>
            <li>I find the shave adapting to my face better after a few days.     </li>
            <li>/&gt;It pick a few hairs here and there but leaves most of them on your face</li>
            <li>I have used Panasonic wet and dry shavers since probably the first one marketed maybe 30 or more years ago.</li>
            <li>In short, it does exactly what you would expect it to do for a decent price.</li>
            <li>It uses the exact same blades and foil as my older ES805S. Amazon.com had the ES4815S on sale for $24.99.</li>
            <li>purchased this shaver and braun for use on a vacation in New Zealand.  </li>
            <li>B000XSBVMU Duracell Value Charger With 4AA Pre Charged Rechargeable Nimh Batteries, CEF14DX4N]], it&#x27;s as practical as any rechargeable shaver, and there isn&#x27;t the problem of buying a new shaver if the batteries stop recharging.</li>
            <li>Plus, it can be used wet or dry and can be cleaned under running water very easily.  </li>
            <li>My skin was very sensitive, so I always suffered from razor burn when using twin-blade razors (ie, Gillette).</li>
            <li>I should have noticed that because it is clearly stated in the amazon page, but I have never heard of a battery powered NON-rechargeable razor before!  </li>
            <li>I bought this exact same one in Hong Kong while on my trip.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver in more than 20 years and my past experience had been one of discomfort and razor burn.  </li>
            <li>Shaves close; holds a charge; can use it wet or dry; and it is very comfortable in your hand.</li>
            <li>Only complaint is the pouch that comes with it, it stuff sticks to it real easily.</li>
            <li>Nothing shaves like a straight razor in the hands of a professional, safety blades are next in effectiveness and then electric shavers.</li>
            <li>I use it two or three times a week and so far have not had to change the batteries.</li>
            <li>But the problem is it frequently cuts me.  </li>
            <li>It is a waste of money no matter how cheap it is.</li>
            <li>In some areas, like round the lips, it actually shaves better than my safety razor.</li>
            <li>I used it dry for the first time on a two day growth and the shave was close to my Gillette Mach III shaves without the irritation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While this Panasonic has a shave head sized 20% smaller than my old rechargeable, the speed and accuracy of this small shaver is more like its big brother and unlike most small battery powered shavers.  </li>
            <li>I currently use a triple-head shaver, model# ES8152 as my main shaver.</li>
            <li>I actually paid $50.00 for this model at Brookstone a few years ago, and it has not disappointed me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a good electric razor that doesn&#x27;t cost a small fortune....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Oh - and for less $$$ I also bought a set of new blades for my old shaver which made it like new</li>
            <li>I use NiMH batteries that last over 2 weeks, are far faster to charge and easier replace.  </li>
            <li>so if you got an old solid shaver just replace the blades .</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s more me missing the hair than the razor missing.</li>
            <li>Although it is small and cuts one day growth OK (I do not have a heavy beard), if you miss a hair or two (and who doesn&#x27;t) and it grows to 1/8\\&quot; or longer, you may as well forget it.</li>
            <li>Buying just the replacement blades and foil cost at least that much, so I bought the new shaver for \\&quot;spare parts.\\&quot;     </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love the size and the shape.  </li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the unit overall as it provides a comfortabe shave, the batterlies have good longevity and the unit is compact, ergonomic, attractive.  </li>
            <li> I gifted this piece to my husband for his Bday.</li>
            <li> As others have suggested, a pop up trimmer (available on rechargable versions) would be a nice addition.</li>
            <li> But does an OK job for traveling.</li>
            <li> key is to use them with shaving gel/foam for best results.</li>
            <li> more could you ask for in a shaver?</li>
            <li> A pleasure to be able to shave on the go and on your way to work.  </li>
            <li> I think this a fair statement, as I slowly began to learn how to best use the shaver over time and my skin also gradually adapted to the machine.  </li>
            <li> Since then I have graduated to using the more advanced Panasonic models over the years.</li>
            <li> It has worked great so far.</li>
            <li> B00007M9SU Braun PocketGo P-70 Men&#x27;s Shaver]] is a good single head travel shaver, but not as good.</li>
            <li> Cleaning it is quite easy.</li>
            <li> I also was looking for a dry/wet shaver and finding one around 30 bucks that I had in mind wasn&#x27;t going to be easy.</li>
            <li> so this electric razor suits me fine.  </li>
            <li> but it is more then adequate for the money you spend.</li>
            <li> free of razorburn.</li>
            <li> Get this discontinued model ES4815s while it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> You can easily wash the razor under tap water which makes it easier to clean.</li>
            <li> I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have left my rechargable panasonic in the hotel, it worked great..</li>
            <li> Cuts close and free of tugging.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the convenience and gets a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> So far giving good battery life too.</li>
            <li> This one pulls my neck hair and isn&#x27;t really all that effective at a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> I was originally looking for an $80-90 wet/shave rechargeable shaver.</li>
            <li> i got very good shaves, tho not as fast as my regular panasonic.  </li>
            <li> and it looks clean.</li>
            <li> tried it in shower, not quite a clean shave, and you still need to look in the mirror to not miss any thing.</li>
            <li> Need to clean after every shave.  </li>
            <li> use it every day or for travel, wet or dry, a great value and a great shave.</li>
            <li> It shaves well, is powerful and actually so easy to clean with liquid hand soap under running water that it&#x27;s fun.  </li>
            <li> I have used it in the shower with lather but doesn&#x27;t really seem to do much better.</li>
            <li> Uses AA batteries, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about replacing the whole shaver like most electrics that start losing their charging ability.</li>
            <li> It has good power and will last for 20+ shaves on just 2 AA alkaline batteries.</li>
            <li> but it is full.</li>
            <li> It not only has surprising power for a batter operated razor, but it&#x27;s versatility as a dry/wet shaver</li>
            <li> It works good as a shaver and the batteries seem to last forever</li>
            <li> The  back-and-forth motion of the dual-head system seems fairly time-consuming, especially on my head.  </li>
            <li> not bad.  </li>
            <li> By me slowing down it gives me a great smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my first set of AA batteries and it&#x27;s still running strong.  </li>
            <li> The shave is satisfactory, the battery life is adequate, and it&#x27;s lighter than the full size Panasonic I had been carrying.</li>
            <li> Gives a good dry shave and wet shave is great too.</li>
            <li> That sold me and I have been a loyal Panasonic user ever since.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had an older model Panasonic wet-dry shaver that I just love.  </li>
            <li> A solid well built , stylish , cute but</li>
            <li> Now that is a nice shaver (when the blades are sharp) but it needs better batteries.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite as powerful as the full size shavers, but it does give a good wet shave.  </li>
            <li> This is a great little razor.</li>
            <li> but now it gives me very close smooth shave )</li>
            <li> The blue touch is nice.</li>
            <li> It is ergonomically better than the older ES805S, although the ES805S is still very ergonomic.</li>
            <li> I bought the right product.    </li>
            <li> It shaves clean, fast, but all rechargeables have built in obsolescence as the battery dies.  </li>
            <li> This leads me to the main reason that I am a true and loyal fan of the Panasonic Wet/Dry shavers.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Pricewise, for $25, there is no other competitor that provides as many features/benefits as the Panasonic ES4815S Pro Curve.</li>
            <li> In all seriousness, this little shaver does a better job than my Braun 9595 costing much more.  </li>
            <li> I bought some NiMH rechargeables and they are working fine so far.    </li>
            <li> But,for my husband,whenevere he use this ,he has to use the normal razor again to have a clean shave.</li>
            <li> They seems to be hard to find, but if you do find one, it makes a great travel shaver.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, it works great!</li>
            <li> &quot; means exactly that.</li>
            <li> I can only expect even better results when I use it with foam shaving cream or shower gel.</li>
            <li> I, however, found this razor fitting all my criteria above.    </li>
            <li> You will end up using the battery a bit more as you will keep it running under water while cleaning, but that shouldn&#x27;t be a big deal if you have rechargeable AA batteries or the set of 20 from IKEA for 2 bucks!    </li>
            <li> This is the first electric razor I have owned.</li>
            <li> So theoretically I should get more use out of this shaver.</li>
            <li> this shaver couldn&#x27;t cut a baby, it really doesn&#x27;t get the job done even if u give your face the time to adjust, I can&#x27;t say its worth the money</li>
            <li> This is my first wet/dry shaver</li>
            <li> but it was not enough better so returned to the $25-$30 range.</li>
            <li> It has run on the first set of batteries for over a month and is still going.</li>
            <li> I have a top of line Brum shaver, getting this one just for back up and the travel shaver.  </li>
            <li> This is very good wet and dry</li>
            <li> I did get some slight skin burn, but other then that it did excellent work!</li>
            <li> As far as the quality of the shave, it is being okay so far.</li>
            <li> only good things are you can wash it in water, and takes regular batteries.</li>
            <li> My experience with Panasonic ES4815S Pro Curve was a positive one, although every now</li>
            <li> You are strongly urged (as in the manual) to use it for 30 days before arriving at a final opinion and that seems to make sense.</li>
            <li> The instructions said to allow up to 3 weeks for the skin to get used to the new shave, but with only mild discomfort on my face and the back of my neck the first shave, afterwards has been very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> &quot; Why else buy a shaver that is \\&quot;wet\\&quot; capable?</li>
            <li> I get very smooth/close shaves with shower gel.</li>
            <li> This two head shaver gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li> With modern, no memory, NIMH batteries and charger</li>
            <li> I do not have a very dense beard</li>
            <li> and I had to replace the whole shaver.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this shaver.  </li>
            <li> It is not the cleanest shave but its very close.</li>
            <li> and it performs better than expected.  </li>
            <li> The replacement batteries cost as much as the battery powered shaver.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES48155 Pro Curve Compact Shaver has really delivered.  </li>
            <li> It cuts well, doesn&#x27;t pull, and is really waterproof.  </li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for the road trip did not expecting much.</li>
            <li> but here I get a really non-figuritivly close shave.  </li>
            <li> I use it in the shower with just shampoo on my head as a lubricant (I use regular shaving cream on my face) and I am amazed at just how smooth a shave I get.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li> After using this about 10 times I&#x27;m ready to throw it away.</li>
            <li> far the ES4815 has been like every Panasonic wet/dry shaver I&#x27;ve owned; economical, reliable, and durable.   </li>
            <li> Most of you are probably too young to remember, but Panasonic introduced the first wet/dry shaver as a single foil shaver named \\&quot;Mr.</li>
            <li> You can ONLY \\&quot;rinse\\&quot; the shaver clean under water.</li>
            <li> Cutters run a lot faster than my last two Panasonics and that helps to minimize any tugging and helps with a clean shave.</li>
            <li> Maybe,its good for daily use or less hair.</li>
            <li> Overall I can say,its OK only.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;curve\\&quot; makes it a little more maneuverable.</li>
            <li> , this little inexpensive non-rechargable works vastly better.  </li>
            <li> The ES4815s does not have the power or size of the normally used electric but works almost well.       </li>
            <li> I find the shave adapting to my face better after a few days.     </li>
            <li> /&gt;It pick a few hairs here and there but leaves most of them on your face</li>
            <li> I have used Panasonic wet and dry shavers since probably the first one marketed maybe 30 or more years ago.</li>
            <li> In short, it does exactly what you would expect it to do for a decent price.</li>
            <li> It uses the exact same blades and foil as my older ES805S. Amazon.com had the ES4815S on sale for $24.99.</li>
            <li> purchased this shaver and braun for use on a vacation in New Zealand.  </li>
            <li> B000XSBVMU Duracell Value Charger With 4AA Pre Charged Rechargeable Nimh Batteries, CEF14DX4N]], it&#x27;s as practical as any rechargeable shaver, and there isn&#x27;t the problem of buying a new shaver if the batteries stop recharging.</li>
            <li> Plus, it can be used wet or dry and can be cleaned under running water very easily.  </li>
            <li> My skin was very sensitive, so I always suffered from razor burn when using twin-blade razors (ie, Gillette).</li>
            <li> I should have noticed that because it is clearly stated in the amazon page, but I have never heard of a battery powered NON-rechargeable razor before!  </li>
            <li> I bought this exact same one in Hong Kong while on my trip.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver in more than 20 years and my past experience had been one of discomfort and razor burn.  </li>
            <li> Shaves close; holds a charge; can use it wet or dry; and it is very comfortable in your hand.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is the pouch that comes with it, it stuff sticks to it real easily.</li>
            <li> Nothing shaves like a straight razor in the hands of a professional, safety blades are next in effectiveness and then electric shavers.</li>
            <li> I use it two or three times a week and so far have not had to change the batteries.</li>
            <li> But the problem is it frequently cuts me.  </li>
            <li> It is a waste of money no matter how cheap it is.</li>
            <li> In some areas, like round the lips, it actually shaves better than my safety razor.</li>
            <li> I used it dry for the first time on a two day growth and the shave was close to my Gillette Mach III shaves without the irritation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While this Panasonic has a shave head sized 20% smaller than my old rechargeable, the speed and accuracy of this small shaver is more like its big brother and unlike most small battery powered shavers.  </li>
            <li> I currently use a triple-head shaver, model# ES8152 as my main shaver.</li>
            <li> I actually paid $50.00 for this model at Brookstone a few years ago, and it has not disappointed me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a good electric razor that doesn&#x27;t cost a small fortune....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Oh - and for less $$$ I also bought a set of new blades for my old shaver which made it like new</li>
            <li> I use NiMH batteries that last over 2 weeks, are far faster to charge and easier replace.  </li>
            <li> so if you got an old solid shaver just replace the blades .</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s more me missing the hair than the razor missing.</li>
            <li> Although it is small and cuts one day growth OK (I do not have a heavy beard), if you miss a hair or two (and who doesn&#x27;t) and it grows to 1/8\\&quot; or longer, you may as well forget it.</li>
            <li> Buying just the replacement blades and foil cost at least that much, so I bought the new shaver for \\&quot;spare parts.\\&quot;     </li>
            <li> the price, it&#x27;s really a long lasting disposable shaver.</li>
            <li> I am assuming that these people use these shavers as a \\&quot;dry\\&quot; shaver, and in my opinion, regardless of which brand electric shaver you use, you will generally never get as close a shave as with a blade.</li>
            <li> None, other than it does not have a pop-up trimmer, but I assume that is possibly due to the high drain power on batteries.       </li>
            <li> I was going to take it to Mt. Everst just for the weight (not ideal, but lighter than my full size one), but I left it at home by mistake anyway.</li>
            <li> I also tried various other electric shavers, including Remington &amp; Norelco, but I just never felt I got a close enough shave, not to mention,</li>
            <li> This little shaver cuts through the tough stuff with easy.  </li>
            <li> Now I wonder why I waited so long.</li>
            <li> There are a couple of minor drawbacks for me:  </li>
            <li> but a shaver should handle 3mm long hairs .</li>
            <li> You will notice that Panasonic shavers that are \\&quot;rinseable\\&quot; will generally cost less than shavers that are classified</li>
            <li> It is much quieter and has less vibration than the small, single head shavers.</li>
            <li> The actual shaving head is about 1/2 to 2/3rds as long as a typical shaver.  </li>
            <li> Can use wet or dry.</li>
            <li> It does not work at all, whichever way you use it: wet or dry.</li>
            <li> This model cost less than the replacement head and screen for my present shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Braun users for years, but after using this little travel model, I might switch to Panasonic for my home shaver next time around.  </li>
            <li> I actually bought this little gem of an electric shaver to keep my head shaved - I still use a blade razor on my face.  </li>
            <li> However, it has a solid, expensive feel and shaves very well.</li>
            <li> I have a short beard round the jawline and on my chin.</li>
            <li> But it shaves close enough so you can use it everyday.</li>
            <li> For longer facial hair or thicker beards, I&#x27;m not confident this product would work that well.  </li>
            <li> I use it every other day and then use my manual razor on the off days.  </li>
            <li> I picked one up for my one-bag travel efforts because it&#x27;s small, lightweight, wet/dry and runs on standard AA batteries.</li>
            <li> It is a total waste of money!</li>
            <li> Usually the low end models.</li>
            <li> This shaver is small enough</li>
            <li> It does take a slightly longer time to shave, but not much so.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked to see that this little shaver shaves better than the other one!</li>
            <li> Even in the shower it is very difficult to get a clean shave for my medium beard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth using.      </li>
            <li> Only concern is that the snap on plastic blade cover may not stay in place in my shaving kit when I travel, leaving the delicate foil screen unprotected.</li>
            <li> I use my beard trimmer to shape and trim my beard and then to mow down the hair I want to shave with the Pro-Curve.</li>
            <li> So, if you are proactive and order them ahead of time, you never will have any down time with this nifty shaver.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it quicker than a blade, just less of a hassle.</li>
            <li> Worked out well for travel as it takes up less space</li>
            <li> Slight after shave burns.</li>
            <li> It is about the half of the weight, so</li>
            <li> a dry shaver it is not nearly as good as my other ones.</li>
            <li> I was presentable, but I could feel a little stubble.</li>
            <li> If you skip a day or 2 of shaving, it takes a little longer to shave.</li>
            <li> And then I discovered this little gem.</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t get over the spunk this little guys has.  </li>
            <li> Little noisy and does NOT come with cleaning brush.  </li>
            <li> dont know why , but the foil holes look too small compared with other shavers , It also irritates and causes cuts .</li>
            <li> The newer ES3833s, slightly cheaper, single head Panasonic [[ASIN:B001CS2JEO Panasonic ES3833S Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Travel Shaver with Case, Silver]] is not nearly as good as either.</li>
            <li> It shocked and disppointed me that it made much bigger noise than the one of 10 years old.</li>
            <li> If it misses a few of those longer hairs just grab a disposable razor and knock them off.</li>
            <li> One thing missing is the hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> I needed a compact battery operated electric shaver for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I do not have a heavy beard</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard, needing to shave again in the evening if I want to look well groomed.  </li>
            <li> Bought this a few weeks ago, and these are my impressions:    </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s missing a trimmer</li>
            <li> - I guess their is a reason why it is heavy discounted .</li>
            <li> it is small and can use rechargeable AA batteries.  </li>
            <li> It gives an unbelievably close shave.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by its small size.</li>
            <li> Instead of upgrading the batteries, I tried this small portable Panasonic instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my last panasonic razor was an expensive rechargable model and i would give it a 1 star</li>
            <li> Not that small either.</li>
            <li> I usually shave every day, but skipping a couple of days will kill the shaver&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Something is wrong with this model and I wish I hadnt bought it and have it shipped to me outside the US</li>
            <li> But the secret to using the ES4815S, or any other Panasonic Wet/Dry shaver is to shave</li>
            <li> It allows people like you and me to order spare parts in advance before the unit breaks down, or even worse, the replacement parts are discontinued.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Eventually, after a couple of years, the seals and o-rings go bad, and it&#x27;s time to get a new shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not pushing hard</li>
            <li> b/c I don&#x27;t grow facial hair like crazy...</li>
            <li> I have read a lot of reviews about Panasonic wet/dry shavers and I am literally astonished whenever I read a negative review.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I found the reviews of electric wet/dry shavers somewhat confusing because the responses varied so widely.  </li>
            <li> It is very small and runs on batteries.</li>
            <li> It is very small.  </li>
            <li> Like all screen based electric shavers it is not great at picking up and cutting long whiskers.</li>
            <li> Spare parts are rather expensive.</li>
            <li> It was a close shade once before when I purchased the wrong product.</li>
            <li> But I hate using a blade razor where I can&#x27;t see, so I thought electric was the way to go.  </li>
            <li> I get a horrible rash as well as cuts.  </li>

            <li> Nothing shaves like a straight razor in the hands of a professional, safety blades are next in effectiveness and then electric shavers. The ES4815s does not have the power or size of the normally used electric but works almost well.       I bought mine January 4th 2009 (seven months ago). I use it two or three times a week and so far have not had to change the batteries. It will not cut hair longer than stubble. I have a short beard round the jawline and on my chin. I use my beard trimmer to shape and trim my beard and then to mow down the hair I want to shave with the Pro-Curve. This it does and it looks clean. I can still feel the further shortened stubble though.       I don&#x27;t find it quicker than a blade, just less of a hassle.I have used it in the shower with lather but doesn&#x27;t really seem to do much better. In some areas, like round the lips, it actually shaves better than my safety razor. It is very good if you just want to improve the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow before going out to dinner. When on a cruise, for example, when you want to look clean shaven before going to the dining room, then I would use it most days with good effect. In short, it does exactly what you would expect it to do for a decent price.</li>
            <li> I actually like this razor quite a bit b/c it is small and can use rechargeable AA batteries.  Plus, it can be used wet or dry and can be cleaned under running water very easily.  This razor also works for me b/c I don&#x27;t grow facial hair like crazy... only short stubbles.  For longer facial hair or thicker beards, I&#x27;m not confident this product would work that well.  For the latter reason,  I only give 3 stars.</li>
            <li> purchased this shaver and braun for use on a vacation in New Zealand.  the braun arrived the day i was leaving so it wasn&#x27;t used.  i got very good shaves, tho not as fast as my regular panasonic.  I used it daily for 21 days, about 5 minutes per shave.  The speed finally was noticeably slower a day after i returned home.  i didn&#x27;t miss the trimmer.  Worked out well for travel as it takes up less space and you don&#x27;t have to worry about different voltages and adaptor plugs.</li>
            <li> Strengths: Close shave. Can use wet or dry. Uses AA batteries, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about replacing the whole shaver like most electrics that start losing their charging ability. Remarkably low price!       Weaknesses: None, other than it does not have a pop-up trimmer, but I assume that is possibly due to the high drain power on batteries.       Summary: I have been a faithful Panasonic electric \\&quot;wet/dry\\&quot; shaver user for over 25 years. I started using their shavers when I was a teenager. My skin was very sensitive, so I always suffered from razor burn when using twin-blade razors (ie, Gillette). I also tried various other electric shavers, including Remington &amp; Norelco, but I just never felt I got a close enough shave, not to mention, I did not like splashing those pre-shave lotions on my face. Kind of made my face feel oily.     Most of you are probably too young to remember, but Panasonic introduced the first wet/dry shaver as a single foil shaver named \\&quot;Mr. Whisk.\\&quot; They showed a picture of the shaver running under water and another with a guy using shaving cream while shaving with Mr. Whisk. That sold me and I have been a loyal Panasonic user ever since. The ability to use shaving cream combined with an electric shaver literally saved my face.     Since then I have graduated to using the more advanced Panasonic models over the years. I currently use a triple-head shaver, model# ES8152 as my main shaver. Needless to say, it works great! It gives an unbelievably close shave. However, for traveling, I prefer NOT to lug around a charger. Thus, this is why I bought the ES4815S. Since it uses AA batteries, I never have to worry about charging. I just keep an extra pair of batteries in my travel bag and I&#x27;m set.     I should mention that I am an owner of another Panasonic wet/dry travel shaver, model# ES805S. I actually paid $50.00 for this model at Brookstone a few years ago, and it has not disappointed me. I was actually looking to buy an extra set of blades and foil for my ES805S, when I came across the ES4815S. It uses the exact same blades and foil as my older ES805S. Amazon.com had the ES4815S on sale for $24.99. Buying just the replacement blades and foil cost at least that much, so I bought the new shaver for \\&quot;spare parts.\\&quot;     However, after the ES4815S arrived, I decided to try it out. It is ergonomically better than the older ES805S, although the ES805S is still very ergonomic. The \\&quot;curve\\&quot; makes it a little more maneuverable. The shave is excellent. Don&#x27;t be fooled by its small size. It has good power and will last for 20+ shaves on just 2 AA alkaline batteries. Although I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, I assume you will get more shaves with 2400 mAh Ni-Mh rechargeable batteries. That&#x27;s what else is nice about this shaver. You never have to worry about a power source. You can opt to use rechargeables or alkalines. You won&#x27;t have to throw away the shaver when the built-in batteries lose their charging ability, as we all know will eventually happen with any rechargeable product. I wish Panasonic would make ALL of their shavers operate with REPLACEABLE batteries as with the ES4815S.     I have read a lot of reviews about Panasonic wet/dry shavers and I am literally astonished whenever I read a negative review. I am assuming that these people use these shavers as a \\&quot;dry\\&quot; shaver, and in my opinion, regardless of which brand electric shaver you use, you will generally never get as close a shave as with a blade. Something that people do not think about is when you shave with a blade, you are shaving \\&quot;wet\\&quot; (i.e., with shaving cream or gel). Why? Because it reduces friction against your skin. If you did not shave \\&quot;wet\\&quot;, you would cut up your skin. The principle is no different with an electric shaver. You want to reduce the friction against your face to get a smoother, closer shave. I have shaved \\&quot;dry\\&quot; with the ES4815S when I was in a hurry. I was presentable, but I could feel a little stubble. If I had used a pre-shave lotion, myshave would have been closer. But the secret to using the ES4815S, or any other Panasonic Wet/Dry shaver is to shave \\&quot;wet.\\&quot; Why else buy a shaver that is \\&quot;wet\\&quot; capable? It does not make any sense to me. Save yourself some money and buy a \\&quot;dry\\&quot; or \\&quot;rinseable\\&quot; shaver. If you buy a shaver designated \\&quot;wet/dry\\&quot;, you are paying extra for that ability. Look this fact up on PriceGrabber.com or Amazon.com. You will notice that Panasonic shavers that are \\&quot;rinseable\\&quot; will generally cost less than shavers that are classified \\&quot;wet/dry\\&quot;. \\&quot;Rinseable\\&quot; means exactly that. You can ONLY \\&quot;rinse\\&quot; the shaver clean under water. You CANNOT shave in the shower as with a \\&quot;wet/dry\\&quot; shaver.     This leads me to the main reason that I am a true and loyal fan of the Panasonic Wet/Dry shavers. I prefer to shave in the shower. The best friction reducer you can use while shaving \\&quot;wet\\&quot; is shower/bath gel (NOT shaving cream/gel). I get very smooth/close shaves with shower gel. Also, since I use shower gel, the shaver is being cleaned as I shave!     The only warning that I will give when using the ES4815S is to shave daily with it. If you skip a day or 2 of shaving, it takes a little longer to shave. I would recommend a Panasonic triple-head shaver if you skip days of shaving.     The only feature I wish Panasonic would add to this shaver is a pop-up trimmer.</li>
            <li> I was originally looking for an $80-90 wet/shave rechargeable shaver. And then I discovered this little gem. This two head shaver gives a very close shave. free of razorburn. It is much quieter and has less vibration than the small, single head shavers. With modern, no memory, NIMH batteries and charger [[ASIN:B000XSBVMU Duracell Value Charger With 4AA Pre Charged Rechargeable Nimh Batteries, CEF14DX4N]], it&#x27;s as practical as any rechargeable shaver, and there isn&#x27;t the problem of buying a new shaver if the batteries stop recharging. The Braun P70 [[ASIN:B00007M9SU Braun PocketGo P-70 Men&#x27;s Shaver]] is a good single head travel shaver, but not as good. The newer ES3833s, slightly cheaper, single head Panasonic [[ASIN:B001CS2JEO Panasonic ES3833S Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Travel Shaver with Case, Silver]] is not nearly as good as either. Get this discontinued model ES4815s while it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> I was so impressed with the Panasonic ES4815S travel shaver(runs on two AA batteries) that I had to write my first ever review.I do not have a very dense beard but it is full. I used it dry for the first time on a two day growth and the shave was close to my Gillette Mach III shaves without the irritation. I can only expect even better results when I use it with foam shaving cream or shower gel. It will not shave longer hairs of three or four days growth. IT DOES NOT HAVE A POP UP TRIMMER so grab a pair of scissors for the sideburns. If it misses a few of those longer hairs just grab a disposable razor and knock them off. Cleaning it is quite easy. Spare parts are rather expensive. Same situation as buying ink cartridges for a printer. Someone said this model was discontinued but I would not hesitate to buy the replacement model which probably has a trimmer. I tried a Wahl travel trimmer product for shaving but it did not work at all for that purpose even though the company assured me that it would.  MIKE</li>
            <li> I was using the Braun 370 and 375 for over 3 years and they were starting to tell their age in terms of the quality of shave. I wanted a replacement budget travel shaver. I didn&#x27;t want a rechargeable one as I thought their batteries could die and I had to replace the whole shaver. I also was looking for a dry/wet shaver and finding one around 30 bucks that I had in mind wasn&#x27;t going to be easy. I, however, found this razor fitting all my criteria above.    I find this shaver to be a bit bulkier for a travel shaver. It feels weighty in the hand but that gives me a bit more assurance in a way. The blue touch is nice. You can easily wash the razor under tap water which makes it easier to clean. As far as the quality of the shave, it is being okay so far. Yes, don&#x27;t expect to get a close shave in one pass as the advertisements depict - that will never happen with an elective razor. I find it giving a better shave in the shower with the water or gel on. You will end up using the battery a bit more as you will keep it running under water while cleaning, but that shouldn&#x27;t be a big deal if you have rechargeable AA batteries or the set of 20 from IKEA for 2 bucks!    You are strongly urged (as in the manual) to use it for 30 days before arriving at a final opinion and that seems to make sense. I find the shave adapting to my face better after a few days.     One thing missing is the hair trimmer. Given the price, it is a good value in that you are getting a wet/dry, reliable shaver. It leaves a bit when it comes to the quality of shave after using it for a month. I can&#x27;t change the ratings, but if I could, I would revise it to 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this shaver.  I travel 2-3 nights per week on business and left my larger Panasonic shaver in a hotel so when I replaced it, I bought one of these too.      I love the size and the shape.  I love that I can use rechargable AA batteries and that it will hold a charge for WEEKS!!      But the problem is it frequently cuts me.  I&#x27;m not pushing hard but it just seems to suck up skin under my chin or along the bottom of my neck.  I get a horrible rash as well as cuts.  It&#x27;s not worth using.      I have stopped taking it with me and gone back to brining my full-sized Panasonic ES8152 with me.  Now that is a nice shaver (when the blades are sharp) but it needs better batteries.</li>
            <li> I needed a compact battery operated electric shaver for everyday use. This one work perfectly.    It is not the cleanest shave but its very close. For the price and usefulness, difficult to get better than this.</li>
            <li> This is a great little razor. I have used it for a month now and I&#x27;m very pleased. This is the first electric razor I have owned. I&#x27;m 57 and decided to give electric razors a try. Now I wonder why I waited so long. This razor does miss hair but I think it&#x27;s more me missing the hair than the razor missing. By me slowing down it gives me a great smooth shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a good electric razor that doesn&#x27;t cost a small fortune....this one is great!  Got it two weeks ago and it performs better than expected.  Shaves close; holds a charge; can use it wet or dry; and it is very comfortable in your hand.</li>
            <li> This razor is working great. It is very small and runs on batteries. I have used it daily for about a month and not had to change the batteries yet</li>
            <li> Been using this electric razor for close to a year and it still works great.  I do not have a heavy beard so this electric razor suits me fine.  I use it every other day and then use my manual razor on the off days.  Not going to give you the best shave but it is more then adequate for the money you spend.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I found the reviews of electric wet/dry shavers somewhat confusing because the responses varied so widely.  The manual on the Panasonic ES4815S Pro Curve says that you need to try shaving with it for one month to get accustomed to the shaving system.  I think this a fair statement, as I slowly began to learn how to best use the shaver over time and my skin also gradually adapted to the machine.  I think many people expect the same close shave that their razor provides from a wet/dry electric shaver, which is unfair.  My experience with Panasonic ES4815S Pro Curve was a positive one, although every now and then I need to touch up areas of my face with my Gilette Sensor Excel.  I am satisfied with the unit overall as it provides a comfortabe shave, the batterlies have good longevity and the unit is compact, ergonomic, attractive.  Panasonic deserves an extra pat on the back for the order sheet included in the box that lists parts on the shaver that need replacing after one or two years of use.  It allows people like you and me to order spare parts in advance before the unit breaks down, or even worse, the replacement parts are discontinued.  So, if you are proactive and order them ahead of time, you never will have any down time with this nifty shaver. &lt;br /&gt;Pricewise, for $25, there is no other competitor that provides as many features/benefits as the Panasonic ES4815S Pro Curve.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite as powerful as the full size shavers, but it does give a good wet shave.  The one advantage I see it having over rechargeables is that you don&#x27;t have to worry about the nicad battery losing its ability to hold a charge because it runs on 2 AA batteries.  It&#x27;s been my experience that the battery will give out before the actual mechanics of the shaver.  So theoretically I should get more use out of this shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had an older model Panasonic wet-dry shaver that I just love.  It shaves clean, fast, but all rechargeables have built in obsolescence as the battery dies.  The replacement batteries cost as much as the battery powered shaver.  Instead of upgrading the batteries, I tried this small portable Panasonic instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this Panasonic has a shave head sized 20% smaller than my old rechargeable, the speed and accuracy of this small shaver is more like its big brother and unlike most small battery powered shavers.  It does take a slightly longer time to shave, but not much so.  Its smaller, so one has to hold it differently.  However, it has a solid, expensive feel and shaves very well. I use NiMH batteries that last over 2 weeks, are far faster to charge and easier replace.  Now, the only reason for this shaver to die is if motor dies, something I haven&#x27;t had to experience in 30+ years of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if the blade were as big as rechargeable shavers and came with a trimmer.</li>
            <li> They seems to be hard to find, but if you do find one, it makes a great travel shaver.  I picked one up for my one-bag travel efforts because it&#x27;s small, lightweight, wet/dry and runs on standard AA batteries. No chargers to forget, wash and go.  I&#x27;ve been a Braun users for years, but after using this little travel model, I might switch to Panasonic for my home shaver next time around.  In all seriousness, this little shaver does a better job than my Braun 9595 costing much more.  I&#x27;m very impressed.    I have a heavy beard, needing to shave again in the evening if I want to look well groomed.  This little shaver cuts through the tough stuff with easy.  I just couldn&#x27;t get over the spunk this little guys has.  As I said, great for carry-on travel.</li>
            <li> this shaver couldn&#x27;t cut a baby, it really doesn&#x27;t get the job done even if u give your face the time to adjust, I can&#x27;t say its worth the money</li>
            <li> Bought this a few weeks ago, and these are my impressions:    1. It is very small.  The actual shaving head is about 1/2 to 2/3rds as long as a typical shaver.  This means it takes longer to shave.    2. Shaves just great.    3. Works just great in the shower.  This is my first wet/dry shaver and I love shaving in the shower now!    4. It is NOT rechargeable.  I should have noticed that because it is clearly stated in the amazon page, but I have never heard of a battery powered NON-rechargeable razor before!  Surprise!    5. It burned through a set of two AA batteries in about a week or 10 days for me.  I bought some NiMH rechargeables and they are working fine so far.    Hope this helps!    (...)</li>
            <li> I gifted this piece to my husband for his Bday. He tried it and said its not that good. Since he use to shave for every 2 days,this one is not that effecient for 2 days hair. Maybe,its good for daily use or less hair. But,for my husband,whenevere he use this ,he has to use the normal razor again to have a clean shave. And its not working for his chin part and neck part.Overall I can say,its OK only.Not upto my expectation.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES48155 Pro Curve Compact Shaver has really delivered.  It not only has surprising power for a batter operated razor, but it&#x27;s versatility as a dry/wet shaver is very good.  It cuts well, doesn&#x27;t pull, and is really waterproof.  It travels well, and I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ve had a closer shave from a battery operated razor before.</li>
            <li> The shaver is anything but a shaver. There is no way panasonic would manufacture and market such a product. It does not work at all, whichever way you use it: wet or dry. It is a total waste of money!</li>
            <li> This one pulls my neck hair and isn&#x27;t really all that effective at a clean shave.  Even in the shower it is very difficult to get a clean shave for my medium beard. I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have left my rechargable panasonic in the hotel, it worked great..</li>
            <li> My husband had a shaver which he used for 10 years. It was very quiet until recently. I purchase this one as a replacement. It shocked and disppointed me that it made much bigger noise than the one of 10 years old. It is a waste of money no matter how cheap it is.</li>
            <li> This is the best battery operated razor that I have ever purchased...bought two more as gifts</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for the road trip did not expecting much. My regular shaver is Panasonic Nano shaver that costs well above hundred dollars. I was shocked to see that this little shaver shaves better than the other one! I did get some slight skin burn, but other then that it did excellent work!</li>
            <li> my last panasonic razor was an expensive rechargable model and i would give it a 1 star, this little inexpensive non-rechargable works vastly better.  use it every day or for travel, wet or dry, a great value and a great shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this exact same one in Hong Kong while on my trip. It has worked great so far. Gives a good dry shave and wet shave is great too. Only complaint is the pouch that comes with it, it stuff sticks to it real easily.</li>
            <li> I have used Panasonic wet and dry shavers since probably the first one marketed maybe 30 or more years ago. I probably have had 6 or seven in that time. Usually the low end models. Once I purchased one in the $70 range and liked it but it was not enough better so returned to the $25-$30 range. This model cost less than the replacement head and screen for my present shaver. It has run on the first set of batteries for over a month and is still going. Am thinking of buying another one just in case the model is discontinued. Since it uses AA batteries I do not have worry about rechargables going South.</li>
            <li> I bought the right product.    It was a close shade once before when I purchased the wrong product. Managed to return same to the store.    ...but here I get a really non-figuritivly close shave.  my whiskers are SO happy.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this little gem of an electric shaver to keep my head shaved - I still use a blade razor on my face.  But I hate using a blade razor where I can&#x27;t see, so I thought electric was the way to go.  For the price, I didn&#x27;t think I could lose.  Well, I won.  I&#x27;m in love with this product!  I&#x27;m on my first set of AA batteries and it&#x27;s still running strong.  It shaves well, is powerful and actually so easy to clean with liquid hand soap under running water that it&#x27;s fun.  I even tried using it with shave cream on my head.  Worked even better!  And it fits my hand so nicely.  I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> Bought years ago and it still works.It works good as a shaver and the batteries seem to last forever but it&#x27;s missing a trimmer and I feel all elect.shavers should have one.</li>
            <li> The shaver turned out to be a very good buy. Battery life and power are excellent. As others have suggested, a pop up trimmer (available on rechargable versions) would be a nice addition.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot and I needed a lightweight, portable,wet/dry electric shaver. This Panasonic model has proven to be just what I needed. The shave is satisfactory, the battery life is adequate, and it&#x27;s lighter than the full size Panasonic I had been carrying. I did invest in a rechargeable battery system.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver in more than 20 years and my past experience had been one of discomfort and razor burn.  I shave both my face and head now and was looking for a wet/dry shaver to use in the shower to save time.  The instructions said to allow up to 3 weeks for the skin to get used to the new shave, but with only mild discomfort on my face and the back of my neck the first shave, afterwards has been very comfortable.  I use it in the shower with just shampoo on my head as a lubricant (I use regular shaving cream on my face) and I am amazed at just how smooth a shave I get.  There are a couple of minor drawbacks for me:  I did not know the product required batteries (I had assumed it was rechargeable).  The  back-and-forth motion of the dual-head system seems fairly time-consuming, especially on my head.  I&#x27;m thinking of going with a triple-head rotary model, like Norelco, just to speed things up.</li>
            <li> This is very good wet and dry shaver(battery operated one) I have come across. I liked it. It gives very nice and smooth shave. So far giving good battery life too.</li>
            <li> I have a top of line Brum shaver, getting this one just for back up and the travel shaver.  &lt;br /&gt;I tried it in shower, not quite a clean shave, and you still need to look in the mirror to not miss any thing. Slight after shave burns. &lt;br /&gt;As a dry shaver it is not nearly as good as my other ones. But does an OK job for traveling. Not that small either. It is about the half of the weight, so I was going to take it to Mt. Everst just for the weight (not ideal, but lighter than my full size one), but I left it at home by mistake anyway. &lt;br /&gt;The only good things are you can wash it in water, and takes regular batteries.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco, Remington, Braun and in recent years Panasonic shavers for 40+ years. This is the best by far to date. Cuts close and free of tugging. I usually shave every day, but skipping a couple of days will kill the shaver&#x27;s performance. Like all screen based electric shavers it is not great at picking up and cutting long whiskers. I run it on a couple of Sanyo Enerloop rechargable batteries. Cutters run a lot faster than my last two Panasonics and that helps to minimize any tugging and helps with a clean shave. Only concern is that the snap on plastic blade cover may not stay in place in my shaving kit when I travel, leaving the delicate foil screen unprotected. I may throw a rubber band around the cover for insurance. Note that this shaver lacks a trimmer for sideburns, mustache or beard.</li>
            <li> It requires two AA batteries, and it produces lots heat when using it.  Don&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li> After using this about 10 times I&#x27;m ready to throw it away. Although it is small and cuts one day growth OK (I do not have a heavy beard), if you miss a hair or two (and who doesn&#x27;t) and it grows to 1/8\\&quot; or longer, you may as well forget it. This razor WILL NOT cut it.     If there was an extendable trimmer on the razor, I would have rated it a 4!</li>
            <li> Works great.  Little noisy and does NOT come with cleaning brush.  Need to clean after every shave.  Good value though.</li>
            <li> This shaver is small enough so it&#x27;s perfect for the road.  But it shaves close enough so you can use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Panasonic Wet/Dry shavers for years, and they&#x27;re great! &lt;br /&gt;The key is to use them with shaving gel/foam for best results. &lt;br /&gt;So far the ES4815 has been like every Panasonic wet/dry shaver I&#x27;ve owned; economical, reliable, and durable.   &lt;br /&gt;Eventually, after a couple of years, the seals and o-rings go bad, and it&#x27;s time to get a new shaver. &lt;br /&gt;For the price, it&#x27;s really a long lasting disposable shaver. &lt;br /&gt;What more could you ask for in a shaver?</li>
            <li> A solid well built , stylish , cute but it DOES NOT do its job . &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It pick a few hairs here and there but leaves most of them on your face , I admit I do not shave daily but a shaver should handle 3mm long hairs . &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I dont know why , but the foil holes look too small compared with other shavers , It also irritates and causes cuts . and I shave under water with Gel . &lt;br /&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;Something is wrong with this model and I wish I hadnt bought it and have it shipped to me outside the US - I guess their is a reason why it is heavy discounted . &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Oh - and for less $$$ I also bought a set of new blades for my old shaver which made it like new ( I wont say the brand but now it gives me very close smooth shave ) so if you got an old solid shaver just replace the blades .</li>
