            <li>i was so happy i put it in after shampooing my hair and covered with a plastic cap no heat for 45mins</li>
            <li>This stuff is great.  </li>
            <li>but it is great</li>
            <li>Great smell.  </li>
            <li>I read all the great reviews on the aussie 3 minute miracle</li>
            <li>but for my daughter&#x27;s frizzy, curly hair it works GREAT.</li>
            <li>This is a great product to use weekly.</li>
            <li>I love this product!!</li>
            <li>This stuff is AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>Amazon Amazing!</li>
            <li>In the morning when washing out, my hair felt strong and silky- impressive.  </li>
            <li>I decided to get this conditioner based off all of the good reviews.</li>
            <li>but I remember I loved both the orange scent and the moisture I felt before and after washing the product out.  </li>
            <li>I use the olive oil relaxer and always loved the replenishing pack it came with.</li>
            <li>A good conditioner and will recommend.</li>
            <li>I continued to use it and loved the way it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li>but i did know that it smelt really good.</li>
            <li>THIS CONDITIONER IS SO GOOD ...</li>
            <li>IT SMELLS SO GOOD</li>
            <li>I use this when I am feeling fairly balanced, or leaning on the low-moisture side.</li>
            <li>This is a perfectly good conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for the full sized bottle!!!</li>
            <li>It truely restores moisture to your hair and especially good if u have damaged hair.</li>
            <li>not bad but not the best</li>
            <li>Oh this conditioner is the best ever, it leaves my hair very soft, and smells beautiful.</li>
            <li>I remember that great smell, and when I rinsed it out after leaving it in for more than an hour my locs felt plush, something I haven&#x27;t experience...</li>
            <li>provides great slip but make sure you rinse all of it out or it will leave ur hair sticky after drying</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner!</li>
            <li>even more so when I perm/relax my hair!</li>
            <li>while it probably helped reduce damage, I did not see the results that I am seeing now as I continue on my healing, healthy hair journey (that is a mouthful!).  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>and oh my god it is amazing.</li>
            <li>This is also a great light protein conditioner.</li>
            <li>It kind of smells citrusy.</li>
            <li>I was able to actually do a good job on my roller wrap because my hair wasn&#x27;t drying out before I could even section it off before beginning.  </li>
            <li>This was a good product that worked well on my 3c/4a hair, but I cannot use this product more than once a month.</li>
            <li>Because I liked [[ASIN:B003YELGF2</li>
            <li>my hair felt stripped liked I shampooed it again.</li>
            <li>I really liked the smell</li>
            <li>I kind of like it but its definatley not all that desirable to me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s magical, but it&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li>I used this conditioner for the first time, and I can honestly say it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>but when I came across this olive oil replenishing paks I fell in love with this stuff and it became a staple for me very good conditioner and does the hair very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;(perm box pretty lol).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad this is now sold in a full size bottle!!  </li>
            <li>My hair feels amazing AND it detangle so easily.    </li>
            <li>Probably one of the many products my girlfriend was trying out when she was studying to be a cosmotologist.  </li>
            <li>I luv, love it.</li>
            <li>I used the best conditioners, like Matrix Biolage conditioning balm and even resorted to homemade treatments like avocado and banana preshampoo masks, but nothing moisturized enough.  </li>
            <li>I love using this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love it and so does my hair :)</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I would use the Organic Root Hair Lotion for more manageability.</li>
            <li>FANTASTIC SLIP!..</li>
            <li>and I love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can only say that this product is excellent.</li>
            <li>I just love the way it makes my hair feel.  </li>
            <li>Now that I am paying more attention to my hair</li>
            <li>This conditioner works okay and smells like tangerines.</li>
            <li>I used to just buy the olive oil packs for hair, but I figured that-- as much as I love the product--</li>
            <li>but these products were doing their jobs but not making the hair healthier or more manageable.</li>
            <li>she wakes up with more curls than frizz.</li>
            <li>I love what it does to my hair.</li>
            <li>When using this product make sure you wash it all out because it will leave a residue on your hair.</li>
            <li>But overall great product!</li>
            <li>and I wont buy this line any more.</li>
            <li>I then apply some more, and then leave it in while I soak; I then rinse again and style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>OK  </li>
            <li>I do love the Olive Oil shampoo tho.</li>
            <li>DEF TOP NOTCH COMPAIRED TO ANY SALON BRANDS</li>
            <li>, my hair has a lot of body and looks healthy</li>
            <li>Love love love this product.</li>
            <li>This product is my favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li>this will be my staple. :)</li>
            <li>Love the smell</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner</li>
            <li>Lovely smell of citrus and cleanliness that lingers well after the shower.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>That way I hold the conditioner on my hair enough time to get the best results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(Many hair/skin products are still using them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I LOVE this condiioner.</li>
            <li>I simply love it.</li>
            <li>I was having more hair loss before using this product.</li>
            <li>ok.&#x27; PASS.</li>
            <li>Most of the time I co-wash, but when I do need to shampoo my hair (mostly for toning)</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful, brings my curls back to life, and makes my hair feel so strong and manageable.</li>
            <li>and I love this on my relaxed fine hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Dr. Miracles and gentle treatment with no problem, but I&#x27;ve always loved olive oil.</li>
            <li>and this is the best conditioner I have ever tried in a very loooong time made both textures of my hair very soft and manageable</li>
            <li>conditioner is NOT a MOISTURE deep conditioner but a LIGHT PROTEIN conditioner with very good moisturizing ingredients.</li>
            <li>Easy to handle and no stickiness.</li>
            <li>When I removed the cap, my hair was so soft and smelled great - like a light orange sorbet.</li>
            <li>i have fine, wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I had fine, brittle, damaged hair.</li>
            <li>Not too strong not to light.  </li>
            <li>I gave it four stars because I didn&#x27;t notice a HUGE difference in my hair</li>
            <li>This makes your hair feel so silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>Me being cheap, I decided to give another perm a try.</li>
            <li>ps its light protein too</li>
            <li>but i don&#x27;t use this conditioner every time i wash my hair because it is a light protein conditioner.</li>
            <li>But after I combined this product with Extra virgin Olive oil, my hair loss reduced greatly.</li>
            <li>but it did leave it soft and smelling good.</li>
            <li>It smells really good (almost like oranges) and it makes my curly hair manageable and soft.  </li>
            <li>At any rate, do not use this to balance out moisture when you have entirely too much protein.&lt;br /&gt;Alone, though, this product is the best conditioner I have ever used, *</li>
            <li>Its not bad at all, its just a strong orange scent..</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>This is the first review that I have ever written on Amazon and it is fitting that it should go to this product.</li>
            <li>This conditioner works great and puts a really good slip into hair so that it&#x27;s easier to comb out tangles and it leaves some oil behind after rinsing so it feels smooth and conditioned.</li>
            <li>I also love the scent; it smells exactly like orange zest.</li>
            <li>I was extremely happy how this made my hair feel, it was soft and made my hair very manageable.  </li>
            <li>and it seems the more i use it, the better her hair is in general.</li>
            <li>AND IT MAKES MY HAIR SO SOFT AND BEAUTIFUL EVEN IN ITS NATURAL STATE...</li>
            <li>I have been wishing for it to come in a full sized bottle forever</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li>I have never used a product that has had such good results with my hair.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my hair feel and it gives so much slip.</li>
            <li>A hairdresser told me to use a full line of products to achieve maximum benefits of the product line.</li>
            <li>If you have fine, oily, or mix textured hair (as in you are biracial), you may want to try the pack first.  </li>
            <li>Also the state my chemically treated hair has improved tremendously.</li>
            <li>That with one a day vitamins has helped my hair tremendously.  </li>
            <li>The whole olive organic olive oil line is great but especially the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say after using this product for the last three months I have noticed a huge difference..</li>
            <li>I highly reccommend this product :)</li>
            <li>a VERY vibrant orange scent- strong, but it is a scent that agrees with my nose</li>
            <li>Wow works really well makes my hair so soft, and smell so good, like citrus!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for good conditioners for my dry hair.</li>
            <li>For some reason, it&#x27;s not as easy for me to comb this conditioner through as it was when the ends were still straight.</li>
            <li>but in a healthy way and this conditioner leaves my hair moisturized and soft!</li>
            <li>It has a great balance of protein and moisture that does not turn my hair into a brittle or gummy mess.</li>
            <li>I mix it with Pantene smooth and straight, sit under the hair dryer for 1/2 hour and then finish up with olive oil (just a dime size) glosser.  </li>
            <li>My hair was soft, smooth, and even SHINY!  </li>
            <li>After conditioning, your hair looks and feels like you&#x27;ve sprayed it with a light sheen because it&#x27;s so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I sat under the dryer for 30 minutes and like magic it made it soft.</li>
            <li>i think the finished result is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I washed my hair and conditioned it with my own stuff, added deep conditioners and everything.</li>
            <li>It did leave my hair soft and moisturized, on top of that</li>
            <li>It&#x27;d probably be too greasy if you have thin or not-dry hair, but for me it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>IT SMELLS LIKE FRESH ORANGES...</li>
            <li>and I think it did a good job of conditioning my hair after the rough treatment</li>
            <li>The price is right and the results are amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unless I find a better deep conditioner, (which I doubt, since it&#x27;s been good to my relaxed, loose and loc&#x27;d hair)</li>
            <li>Cheap and high priced.</li>
            <li>(I probably thought that because my hair is fine, and with locs I think I have a better sense of a product&#x27;s real consistency.)I&#x27;ve been deep conditioning with it since.</li>
            <li>My mother has very coarse hair and uses it, my grandmother and aunt have very fine hair, and they like it as well.</li>
            <li>Then again this is first conditioner I have really tried leaving in so no idea if this one is special or not.</li>
            <li>This is a great moisturizer for African American hair.</li>
            <li>After I use it, I deep condition with a moisturizer (I use Eden Bodyworks deep conditioner) and these two combined work great on wash days.</li>
            <li>help keep my hair soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>I still highly recommend it for transitioners but as for all natural girls and guys, there are better products out there for us.</li>
            <li>The smell is more like a pledge smell instead of being naturally fragranced which could be improved with natural ingredients;);) Would purchase again if this change is made!</li>
            <li>I have lots of natural hair (huge afro)</li>
            <li>I absolutely loveeee this!  </li>
            <li>It was smooth, silky, and soft.</li>
            <li>I was scared that my hair would never gain back its integrity, but I&#x27;m SOOOO glad that they made a bottle version of this stuff.</li>
            <li>so I first purchased the paks to use.</li>
            <li>But I will keep it in mind for future use because it&#x27;s pretty inexpensive and can be found most</li>
            <li>It never fails me, but I now have a problem, I bleached my hair and the first day I bleached it</li>
            <li>After reading all these wonderful reviews, I started wondering was it only for African American hair?</li>
            <li>This really did the trick, even after just one use!</li>
            <li>I am hooked and I will be very upset if my hair stops responding well to this, or they (gasp!) discontinue it.  </li>
            <li>all i have in terms of this conditioner is it really works on my hair type!</li>
            <li>my hair with this, meaning the moisture levels are much higher.</li>
            <li>I first used this conditioner when I switched to the ORS brand of relaxers.</li>
            <li>It tangles easily and gets weighed down easily with richer oils.  </li>
            <li>IT DOES NOT WEIGH MY HAIR DOWN AND MAKES IT MORE MANAGEABLE!</li>
            <li>i love it, my hair stays soooo soft after each use, less frizz, more body</li>
            <li>the orange-y smell from the orange oil is a bit much (smells like orange Ozium air freshener), but somewhat refreshing at the same time, if that makes any sense at all</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so smooth and silky especially with the right shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine (though I have a mountain of it), curly, dry and very porous.  </li>
            <li>I typically alternate my protein and moisture deep conditioning treatments each week, which works exceptionally well for my hair.</li>
            <li>it leaves my hair feeling super soft, shiny, and just  so moisturized.</li>
            <li>What I like the most is after I wash it out and blow dry</li>
            <li>my pleasant surprise, it&#x27;s not as thick as I thought it was</li>
            <li>I haved used this product for three years now and have thought about just ordering a large tub of this because it&#x27;s a part of my hair routine.</li>
            <li>Very highly recommended</li>
            <li>I recommend this to people who are really protein sensitive because it gives a little protein with a good amount of moisture</li>
            <li>Smells like lemon and also makes your hair very soft!!</li>
            <li>so I have just about tried everything in the book,and very choosy what I like and don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helped with tangles in weave and in my real hair, and I&#x27;ve used it to soften up my hair while removing braids.</li>
            <li>These products compliment and work together really well.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get that slip I was hoping for and is was like I put a shampoo on really.</li>
            <li>I never write reviews however I tried this product today, it really works.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know, maybe my hair doesn&#x27;t like much protein.    </li>
            <li>and I go through this really fast.</li>
            <li>is tht much easier.</li>
            <li>Thanks  a million.</li>
            <li>I may as well just buy a whole container to save money.  </li>
            <li>but I do not care so much for the product itself.  </li>
            <li>and it gave me so much moisture and slip</li>
            <li>and so much shine</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t really know what it did for my hair</li>
            <li>this is just too weighty for my hair, doesn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li>It only took a handful to coat my hair (I am used to using 1/4 or 1/2 a bottle sometimes to get through all of my hair) and left it on freshly washed hair overnight (plastic wrap and a fashionable twistie turban :)  </li>
            <li>They are reasonable priced on line.</li>
            <li>and I keep it on for an hour to really let it sink in if you haven&#x27;t tried you</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using it, my bleached TWA has shown so much improvement.</li>
            <li>No matter how much I saturated my hair with the conditioner it would just not allowed my comb through.</li>
            <li>its worth the extra 2 dollars..and this product is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I was seriously considering spending $40 on Alter Ego (which IS very good - shea and coconut worked wonders for me at my local salon),</li>
            <li>It does way more than any other shampoo or conditioner has ever done for my hair.</li>
            <li>Citrus oil, limonene, and linalool are all ingredients towards the top of the list, and I believe the citrus oil and its derivatives are responsible for soothing down the cuticle of the hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought it a few times, and liked it, but I didn&#x27;t keep up with using it as I always wanted to try new products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been natural for almost 4 years now, and as much as I&#x27;ve wanted to stray away from all chemicals, this treatment is like a drug to me!  </li>
            <li>I shampooed my hair normally, put the whole Root Stimulator pack on my hair, covered with a plastic cap and towel and went about my business for an hour.</li>
            <li>Many things would make my hair soft for a day or two, but it was still bone dry!      </li>
            <li>this is why we need products made for us and by us because many people try and just don&#x27;t understand black hair needs.  </li>
            <li>I used this product when I was relaxed mainly because it came in the Olive Oil relaxer kit and didn&#x27;t think twice about it.</li>
            <li>I do mix with an additional oil just for the sake of it, but overall I do love the results of this product and definitely a must have in my regime!</li>
            <li>I particularly like the smell.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this conditioner and fully intend to stock up on it.</li>
            <li>bottle is very compact that you can carry it anywhere or fit it between other shower products without fear that this bottle may fall in your bath tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Organic is not just a label they can use so freely because many people take it very seriously.</li>
            <li>This products natural ingredient are very concentrated that you can feel the smoothness they create when you cover you hair with it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t sit under a dryer, I just use it like a normal conditioner.</li>
            <li>like I normally do.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft enough to feel good, but not so limp that I can&#x27;t do anything with it.</li>
            <li>So, I go and pick up the new motions shine relaxer and give it a try.</li>
            <li>(if you have the new designed bottle seen here, it&#x27;s probably the new formula.)  </li>
            <li>my new growth)..</li>
            <li>I use the Moisture Rentention Raw Shea butter shampoo with this conditioner and BAM my hair feels and looks sooo healthy.</li>
            <li>I currently use a FABULOUS protein deep conditioner</li>
            <li>so I want my moisture deep conditioner to give me the same FABULOUS results.  </li>
            <li>I had been using another fabulous conditioner (Pantene Fortifying Fortifier) but it is getting more difficult to find.</li>
            <li>I apply this conditioner and instead or removing it instantly, I start to apply Old Spice Fresh Collection body wash.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be surprised if the ingredients change again since this brand use not so high quality of ingredients (sulfates, petrolatum, etc.).</li>
            <li>My hair always feels very soft after I use this, and I don&#x27;t have to blow-dry it to keep it from looking frizzy</li>
            <li>Be aware that they rejiggered some of the ingredients recently</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, silky and hydrated!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other deep conditioners and this one is still my favorite.</li>
            <li>Now on the other hand, my best friend used this product and says it left her hair feeling very thick and coated.  </li>
            <li>Only really works for me if I leave it for in a bit, but then does and my hair is super dry.</li>
            <li>hair is not dry, grows fast</li>
            <li>I have tried this conditioner for the first time today and OMG HEAVEN I am currently 9 weeks post transitioning to natural</li>
            <li>Supposedly, you have to keep it on for half an hour or more, it&#x27;s an entire production...  </li>
            <li>Would certainly buy this again when the current one runs out.</li>
            <li>I have 3c natural hair.</li>
            <li>This conditioner leaves my hair soft but it also makes it look oily and feeling coated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been bouncing between relaxers, weaves, short straight cuts, and everything in between.</li>
            <li>and my hair has grown considerably.  </li>
            <li>no amount of oil (natural or store purchased)or moisturizing sheen seemed to help.  </li>
            <li>Check the ingredients, it&#x27;s all about the natural oils.  </li>
            <li>keeps my hair completely moisturized.</li>
            <li>Before I went natural I was using this conditioner</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tried yet since going natural, hmmmm maybe I will.</li>
            <li>After blowdrying and flatironing my hair feels so soft.</li>
            <li>so people are surprised I use this stuff</li>
            <li>My hair is natural and gray.</li>
            <li>I used this product and my hair is actually soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>BTW, I still alternate between moisture and protein dc&#x27;s week to week and have recently found a FABULOUS moisture deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>I thought that I would try this products because of the transitioning process that I am experiencing while going natural</li>
            <li>before i went natural, i use to perm my hair with the ORS perm and it had a pack of this conditioner in it.</li>
            <li>and did i mention soft?</li>
            <li>WOW -</li>
            <li>I am transitioning from relaxed to natural (curly) hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m awaiting the shampoo to complete the treatment.</li>
            <li>Soft and manageble.</li>
            <li>My hair always comes silky and uber soft.</li>
            <li>extremely soft n manageable.great scent</li>
            <li>My hair had no tangles to rat out, and my curls were so soft and well-defined.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that i have relaxed a month ago</li>
            <li>IT LEAVES MY HAIR SO SOFT ...</li>
            <li>MY HAIR IS NATURAL</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>So I used a shampoo which completely stripped my hair.</li>
            <li>Completely.. this conditioner is my mother&#x27;s, and she&#x27;s loves it.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s relaxed and I&#x27;m natural.</li>
            <li>I like to rock a mini afro, and this conditioner makes my hair really soft.</li>
            <li>Organic is only in the name,  which is very misleading.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t like to be forced to write so many words.</li>
            <li>It works just as much now as it did a few years ago when I first started using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have 4a-c, very coily, thin, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>but unfortunately  I have not used it since and even though I get so many compliments on the color, I have so much dryness.</li>
            <li>My hair was very dry from color and perm and this product worked better than any I had tried in the past.</li>
            <li>Ogx (blue bottle) cannot be messed with as far as retaining moisture</li>
            <li>I have used this product directly after a relaxer and it has left my hair feeling strengthened after all that processing.</li>
            <li>what I am left with is soft, shiney, moisturized hair.  </li>
            <li>now that i&#x27;m natural, i can actually feel the difference in my hair of before using this and after.</li>
            <li>I started using this product and it left my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I will be giving her the bottles and switching back to my old shampoo</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it to those with dry brittle hair.</li>
            <li>First off it comes in a decently sized bottle and you only need a little bit to achieve maximum results!</li>
            <li>For hair that is damaged, dry, and out of control this product really brings it back to life.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair so much more softer than any other conditioner I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>It is heavy and very moisturizing, enough so that if I use it with a sulfate-free shampoo I can actually get away without using any product when I get out of the shower (that would have been absolutely UNHEARD OF before trying this).</li>
            <li>Major red flag!)</li>
            <li>Since I am trying to grow my hair longer, at least five inches more as noted in my other reviews, I am taking Biotin which I upgraded to 5000mcg a day.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner is heavily based from natural oils that will likely be too much for oilier hair types.      </li>
            <li>I have been relaxed for a long time now and have decided to transition to be natural.</li>
            <li>after the first use, it was the missing ingredient that we needed in order to get my hair looking like I had just stepped out of the salon.  </li>
            <li>But maybe I was using it wrong due to others having good comments.</li>
            <li>That new conditioner made my hair so dry and tangled that when I finally finished untangling I had about 2 fist fulls of hair on the floor.</li>
            <li>It did nothing for this 4a color treated, natural, dry hair.</li>

            <li> but it is great</li>
            <li> Great smell.  </li>
            <li> I read all the great reviews on the aussie 3 minute miracle</li>

            <li> I love this product!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!  </li>
            <li> Amazon Amazing!</li>
            <li> In the morning when washing out, my hair felt strong and silky- impressive.  </li>
            <li> I decided to get this conditioner based off all of the good reviews.</li>
            <li> but I remember I loved both the orange scent and the moisture I felt before and after washing the product out.  </li>
            <li> I use the olive oil relaxer and always loved the replenishing pack it came with.</li>
            <li> A good conditioner and will recommend.</li>
            <li> I continued to use it and loved the way it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li> but i did know that it smelt really good.</li>
            <li> THIS CONDITIONER IS SO GOOD ...</li>
            <li> IT SMELLS SO GOOD</li>
            <li> I use this when I am feeling fairly balanced, or leaning on the low-moisture side.</li>
            <li> This is a perfectly good conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for the full sized bottle!!!</li>
            <li> It truely restores moisture to your hair and especially good if u have damaged hair.</li>
            <li> not bad but not the best</li>
            <li> Oh this conditioner is the best ever, it leaves my hair very soft, and smells beautiful.</li>
            <li> I remember that great smell, and when I rinsed it out after leaving it in for more than an hour my locs felt plush, something I haven&#x27;t experience...</li>
            <li> provides great slip but make sure you rinse all of it out or it will leave ur hair sticky after drying</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner!</li>
            <li> even more so when I perm/relax my hair!</li>
            <li> while it probably helped reduce damage, I did not see the results that I am seeing now as I continue on my healing, healthy hair journey (that is a mouthful!).  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> and oh my god it is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is also a great light protein conditioner.</li>
            <li> It kind of smells citrusy.</li>
            <li> I was able to actually do a good job on my roller wrap because my hair wasn&#x27;t drying out before I could even section it off before beginning.  </li>
            <li> This was a good product that worked well on my 3c/4a hair, but I cannot use this product more than once a month.</li>
            <li> Because I liked [[ASIN:B003YELGF2</li>
            <li> my hair felt stripped liked I shampooed it again.</li>
            <li> I really liked the smell</li>
            <li> I kind of like it but its definatley not all that desirable to me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s magical, but it&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li> I used this conditioner for the first time, and I can honestly say it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> but when I came across this olive oil replenishing paks I fell in love with this stuff and it became a staple for me very good conditioner and does the hair very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(perm box pretty lol).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad this is now sold in a full size bottle!!  </li>
            <li> My hair feels amazing AND it detangle so easily.    </li>
            <li> Probably one of the many products my girlfriend was trying out when she was studying to be a cosmotologist.  </li>
            <li> I luv, love it.</li>
            <li> I used the best conditioners, like Matrix Biolage conditioning balm and even resorted to homemade treatments like avocado and banana preshampoo masks, but nothing moisturized enough.  </li>
            <li> I love using this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love it and so does my hair :)</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I would use the Organic Root Hair Lotion for more manageability.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC SLIP!..</li>
            <li> and I love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can only say that this product is excellent.</li>
            <li> I just love the way it makes my hair feel.  </li>
            <li> Now that I am paying more attention to my hair</li>
            <li> This conditioner works okay and smells like tangerines.</li>
            <li> I used to just buy the olive oil packs for hair, but I figured that-- as much as I love the product--</li>
            <li> but these products were doing their jobs but not making the hair healthier or more manageable.</li>
            <li> she wakes up with more curls than frizz.</li>
            <li> I love what it does to my hair.</li>
            <li> When using this product make sure you wash it all out because it will leave a residue on your hair.</li>
            <li> But overall great product!</li>
            <li> and I wont buy this line any more.</li>
            <li> I then apply some more, and then leave it in while I soak; I then rinse again and style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> OK  </li>
            <li> I do love the Olive Oil shampoo tho.</li>
            <li> DEF TOP NOTCH COMPAIRED TO ANY SALON BRANDS</li>
            <li> , my hair has a lot of body and looks healthy</li>
            <li> Love love love this product.</li>
            <li> This product is my favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li> this will be my staple. :)</li>
            <li> Love the smell</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner</li>
            <li> Lovely smell of citrus and cleanliness that lingers well after the shower.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> That way I hold the conditioner on my hair enough time to get the best results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Many hair/skin products are still using them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I LOVE this condiioner.</li>
            <li> I simply love it.</li>
            <li> I was having more hair loss before using this product.</li>
            <li> ok.&#x27; PASS.</li>
            <li> Most of the time I co-wash, but when I do need to shampoo my hair (mostly for toning)</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful, brings my curls back to life, and makes my hair feel so strong and manageable.</li>
            <li> and I love this on my relaxed fine hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Dr. Miracles and gentle treatment with no problem, but I&#x27;ve always loved olive oil.</li>
            <li> and this is the best conditioner I have ever tried in a very loooong time made both textures of my hair very soft and manageable</li>
            <li> conditioner is NOT a MOISTURE deep conditioner but a LIGHT PROTEIN conditioner with very good moisturizing ingredients.</li>
            <li> Easy to handle and no stickiness.</li>
            <li> When I removed the cap, my hair was so soft and smelled great - like a light orange sorbet.</li>
            <li> i have fine, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I had fine, brittle, damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Not too strong not to light.  </li>
            <li> I gave it four stars because I didn&#x27;t notice a HUGE difference in my hair</li>
            <li> This makes your hair feel so silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> Me being cheap, I decided to give another perm a try.</li>
            <li> ps its light protein too</li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t use this conditioner every time i wash my hair because it is a light protein conditioner.</li>
            <li> But after I combined this product with Extra virgin Olive oil, my hair loss reduced greatly.</li>
            <li> but it did leave it soft and smelling good.</li>
            <li> It smells really good (almost like oranges) and it makes my curly hair manageable and soft.  </li>
            <li> At any rate, do not use this to balance out moisture when you have entirely too much protein.&lt;br /&gt;Alone, though, this product is the best conditioner I have ever used, *</li>
            <li> Its not bad at all, its just a strong orange scent..</li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> This is the first review that I have ever written on Amazon and it is fitting that it should go to this product.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works great and puts a really good slip into hair so that it&#x27;s easier to comb out tangles and it leaves some oil behind after rinsing so it feels smooth and conditioned.</li>
            <li> I also love the scent; it smells exactly like orange zest.</li>
            <li> I was extremely happy how this made my hair feel, it was soft and made my hair very manageable.  </li>
            <li> and it seems the more i use it, the better her hair is in general.</li>
            <li> AND IT MAKES MY HAIR SO SOFT AND BEAUTIFUL EVEN IN ITS NATURAL STATE...</li>
            <li> I have been wishing for it to come in a full sized bottle forever</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li> I have never used a product that has had such good results with my hair.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my hair feel and it gives so much slip.</li>
            <li> A hairdresser told me to use a full line of products to achieve maximum benefits of the product line.</li>
            <li> If you have fine, oily, or mix textured hair (as in you are biracial), you may want to try the pack first.  </li>
            <li> Also the state my chemically treated hair has improved tremendously.</li>
            <li> That with one a day vitamins has helped my hair tremendously.  </li>
            <li> The whole olive organic olive oil line is great but especially the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say after using this product for the last three months I have noticed a huge difference..</li>
            <li> I highly reccommend this product :)</li>
            <li> a VERY vibrant orange scent- strong, but it is a scent that agrees with my nose</li>
            <li> Wow works really well makes my hair so soft, and smell so good, like citrus!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for good conditioners for my dry hair.</li>
            <li> For some reason, it&#x27;s not as easy for me to comb this conditioner through as it was when the ends were still straight.</li>
            <li> but in a healthy way and this conditioner leaves my hair moisturized and soft!</li>
            <li> It has a great balance of protein and moisture that does not turn my hair into a brittle or gummy mess.</li>
            <li> I mix it with Pantene smooth and straight, sit under the hair dryer for 1/2 hour and then finish up with olive oil (just a dime size) glosser.  </li>
            <li> My hair was soft, smooth, and even SHINY!  </li>
            <li> After conditioning, your hair looks and feels like you&#x27;ve sprayed it with a light sheen because it&#x27;s so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I sat under the dryer for 30 minutes and like magic it made it soft.</li>
            <li> i think the finished result is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair and conditioned it with my own stuff, added deep conditioners and everything.</li>
            <li> It did leave my hair soft and moisturized, on top of that</li>
            <li> It&#x27;d probably be too greasy if you have thin or not-dry hair, but for me it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> IT SMELLS LIKE FRESH ORANGES...</li>
            <li> and I think it did a good job of conditioning my hair after the rough treatment</li>
            <li> The price is right and the results are amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unless I find a better deep conditioner, (which I doubt, since it&#x27;s been good to my relaxed, loose and loc&#x27;d hair)</li>
            <li> Cheap and high priced.</li>
            <li> (I probably thought that because my hair is fine, and with locs I think I have a better sense of a product&#x27;s real consistency.)I&#x27;ve been deep conditioning with it since.</li>
            <li> My mother has very coarse hair and uses it, my grandmother and aunt have very fine hair, and they like it as well.</li>
            <li> Then again this is first conditioner I have really tried leaving in so no idea if this one is special or not.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer for African American hair.</li>
            <li> After I use it, I deep condition with a moisturizer (I use Eden Bodyworks deep conditioner) and these two combined work great on wash days.</li>
            <li> help keep my hair soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> I still highly recommend it for transitioners but as for all natural girls and guys, there are better products out there for us.</li>
            <li> The smell is more like a pledge smell instead of being naturally fragranced which could be improved with natural ingredients;);) Would purchase again if this change is made!</li>
            <li> I have lots of natural hair (huge afro)</li>
            <li> I absolutely loveeee this!  </li>
            <li> It was smooth, silky, and soft.</li>
            <li> I was scared that my hair would never gain back its integrity, but I&#x27;m SOOOO glad that they made a bottle version of this stuff.</li>
            <li> so I first purchased the paks to use.</li>
            <li> But I will keep it in mind for future use because it&#x27;s pretty inexpensive and can be found most</li>
            <li> It never fails me, but I now have a problem, I bleached my hair and the first day I bleached it</li>
            <li> After reading all these wonderful reviews, I started wondering was it only for African American hair?</li>
            <li> This really did the trick, even after just one use!</li>
            <li> I am hooked and I will be very upset if my hair stops responding well to this, or they (gasp!) discontinue it.  </li>
            <li> all i have in terms of this conditioner is it really works on my hair type!</li>
            <li> my hair with this, meaning the moisture levels are much higher.</li>
            <li> I first used this conditioner when I switched to the ORS brand of relaxers.</li>
            <li> It tangles easily and gets weighed down easily with richer oils.  </li>
            <li> IT DOES NOT WEIGH MY HAIR DOWN AND MAKES IT MORE MANAGEABLE!</li>
            <li> i love it, my hair stays soooo soft after each use, less frizz, more body</li>
            <li> the orange-y smell from the orange oil is a bit much (smells like orange Ozium air freshener), but somewhat refreshing at the same time, if that makes any sense at all</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so smooth and silky especially with the right shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine (though I have a mountain of it), curly, dry and very porous.  </li>
            <li> I typically alternate my protein and moisture deep conditioning treatments each week, which works exceptionally well for my hair.</li>
            <li> it leaves my hair feeling super soft, shiny, and just  so moisturized.</li>
            <li> What I like the most is after I wash it out and blow dry</li>
            <li> my pleasant surprise, it&#x27;s not as thick as I thought it was</li>
            <li> I haved used this product for three years now and have thought about just ordering a large tub of this because it&#x27;s a part of my hair routine.</li>
            <li> Very highly recommended</li>
            <li> I recommend this to people who are really protein sensitive because it gives a little protein with a good amount of moisture</li>
            <li> Smells like lemon and also makes your hair very soft!!</li>
            <li> so I have just about tried everything in the book,and very choosy what I like and don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped with tangles in weave and in my real hair, and I&#x27;ve used it to soften up my hair while removing braids.</li>
            <li> These products compliment and work together really well.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get that slip I was hoping for and is was like I put a shampoo on really.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews however I tried this product today, it really works.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, maybe my hair doesn&#x27;t like much protein.    </li>
            <li> and I go through this really fast.</li>
            <li> is tht much easier.</li>
            <li> Thanks  a million.</li>
            <li> I may as well just buy a whole container to save money.  </li>
            <li> but I do not care so much for the product itself.  </li>
            <li> and it gave me so much moisture and slip</li>
            <li> and so much shine</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t really know what it did for my hair</li>
            <li> this is just too weighty for my hair, doesn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li> It only took a handful to coat my hair (I am used to using 1/4 or 1/2 a bottle sometimes to get through all of my hair) and left it on freshly washed hair overnight (plastic wrap and a fashionable twistie turban :)  </li>
            <li> They are reasonable priced on line.</li>
            <li> and I keep it on for an hour to really let it sink in if you haven&#x27;t tried you</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using it, my bleached TWA has shown so much improvement.</li>
            <li> No matter how much I saturated my hair with the conditioner it would just not allowed my comb through.</li>
            <li> its worth the extra 2 dollars..and this product is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I was seriously considering spending $40 on Alter Ego (which IS very good - shea and coconut worked wonders for me at my local salon),</li>
            <li> It does way more than any other shampoo or conditioner has ever done for my hair.</li>
            <li> Citrus oil, limonene, and linalool are all ingredients towards the top of the list, and I believe the citrus oil and its derivatives are responsible for soothing down the cuticle of the hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought it a few times, and liked it, but I didn&#x27;t keep up with using it as I always wanted to try new products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been natural for almost 4 years now, and as much as I&#x27;ve wanted to stray away from all chemicals, this treatment is like a drug to me!  </li>
            <li> I shampooed my hair normally, put the whole Root Stimulator pack on my hair, covered with a plastic cap and towel and went about my business for an hour.</li>
            <li> Many things would make my hair soft for a day or two, but it was still bone dry!      </li>
            <li> this is why we need products made for us and by us because many people try and just don&#x27;t understand black hair needs.  </li>
            <li> I used this product when I was relaxed mainly because it came in the Olive Oil relaxer kit and didn&#x27;t think twice about it.</li>
            <li> I do mix with an additional oil just for the sake of it, but overall I do love the results of this product and definitely a must have in my regime!</li>
            <li> I particularly like the smell.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this conditioner and fully intend to stock up on it.</li>
            <li> bottle is very compact that you can carry it anywhere or fit it between other shower products without fear that this bottle may fall in your bath tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Organic is not just a label they can use so freely because many people take it very seriously.</li>
            <li> This products natural ingredient are very concentrated that you can feel the smoothness they create when you cover you hair with it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t sit under a dryer, I just use it like a normal conditioner.</li>
            <li> like I normally do.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft enough to feel good, but not so limp that I can&#x27;t do anything with it.</li>
            <li> So, I go and pick up the new motions shine relaxer and give it a try.</li>
            <li> (if you have the new designed bottle seen here, it&#x27;s probably the new formula.)  </li>
            <li> my new growth)..</li>
            <li> I use the Moisture Rentention Raw Shea butter shampoo with this conditioner and BAM my hair feels and looks sooo healthy.</li>
            <li> I currently use a FABULOUS protein deep conditioner</li>
            <li> so I want my moisture deep conditioner to give me the same FABULOUS results.  </li>
            <li> I had been using another fabulous conditioner (Pantene Fortifying Fortifier) but it is getting more difficult to find.</li>
            <li> I apply this conditioner and instead or removing it instantly, I start to apply Old Spice Fresh Collection body wash.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be surprised if the ingredients change again since this brand use not so high quality of ingredients (sulfates, petrolatum, etc.).</li>
            <li> My hair always feels very soft after I use this, and I don&#x27;t have to blow-dry it to keep it from looking frizzy</li>
            <li> Be aware that they rejiggered some of the ingredients recently</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, silky and hydrated!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other deep conditioners and this one is still my favorite.</li>
            <li> Now on the other hand, my best friend used this product and says it left her hair feeling very thick and coated.  </li>
            <li> Only really works for me if I leave it for in a bit, but then does and my hair is super dry.</li>
            <li> hair is not dry, grows fast</li>
            <li> I have tried this conditioner for the first time today and OMG HEAVEN I am currently 9 weeks post transitioning to natural</li>
            <li> Supposedly, you have to keep it on for half an hour or more, it&#x27;s an entire production...  </li>
            <li> Would certainly buy this again when the current one runs out.</li>
            <li> I have 3c natural hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves my hair soft but it also makes it look oily and feeling coated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been bouncing between relaxers, weaves, short straight cuts, and everything in between.</li>
            <li> and my hair has grown considerably.  </li>
            <li> no amount of oil (natural or store purchased)or moisturizing sheen seemed to help.  </li>
            <li> Check the ingredients, it&#x27;s all about the natural oils.  </li>
            <li> keeps my hair completely moisturized.</li>
            <li> Before I went natural I was using this conditioner</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried yet since going natural, hmmmm maybe I will.</li>
            <li> After blowdrying and flatironing my hair feels so soft.</li>
            <li> so people are surprised I use this stuff</li>
            <li> My hair is natural and gray.</li>
            <li> I used this product and my hair is actually soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> BTW, I still alternate between moisture and protein dc&#x27;s week to week and have recently found a FABULOUS moisture deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> I thought that I would try this products because of the transitioning process that I am experiencing while going natural</li>
            <li> before i went natural, i use to perm my hair with the ORS perm and it had a pack of this conditioner in it.</li>
            <li> and did i mention soft?</li>
            <li> WOW -</li>
            <li> I am transitioning from relaxed to natural (curly) hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m awaiting the shampoo to complete the treatment.</li>
            <li> Soft and manageble.</li>
            <li> My hair always comes silky and uber soft.</li>
            <li> extremely soft n manageable.great scent</li>
            <li> My hair had no tangles to rat out, and my curls were so soft and well-defined.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that i have relaxed a month ago</li>
            <li> IT LEAVES MY HAIR SO SOFT ...</li>
            <li> MY HAIR IS NATURAL</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> So I used a shampoo which completely stripped my hair.</li>
            <li> Completely.. this conditioner is my mother&#x27;s, and she&#x27;s loves it.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s relaxed and I&#x27;m natural.</li>
            <li> I like to rock a mini afro, and this conditioner makes my hair really soft.</li>
            <li> Organic is only in the name,  which is very misleading.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like to be forced to write so many words.</li>
            <li> It works just as much now as it did a few years ago when I first started using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have 4a-c, very coily, thin, fine hair.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately  I have not used it since and even though I get so many compliments on the color, I have so much dryness.</li>
            <li> My hair was very dry from color and perm and this product worked better than any I had tried in the past.</li>
            <li> Ogx (blue bottle) cannot be messed with as far as retaining moisture</li>
            <li> I have used this product directly after a relaxer and it has left my hair feeling strengthened after all that processing.</li>
            <li> what I am left with is soft, shiney, moisturized hair.  </li>
            <li> now that i&#x27;m natural, i can actually feel the difference in my hair of before using this and after.</li>
            <li> I started using this product and it left my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I will be giving her the bottles and switching back to my old shampoo</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it to those with dry brittle hair.</li>
            <li> First off it comes in a decently sized bottle and you only need a little bit to achieve maximum results!</li>
            <li> For hair that is damaged, dry, and out of control this product really brings it back to life.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair so much more softer than any other conditioner I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> It is heavy and very moisturizing, enough so that if I use it with a sulfate-free shampoo I can actually get away without using any product when I get out of the shower (that would have been absolutely UNHEARD OF before trying this).</li>
            <li> Major red flag!)</li>
            <li> Since I am trying to grow my hair longer, at least five inches more as noted in my other reviews, I am taking Biotin which I upgraded to 5000mcg a day.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner is heavily based from natural oils that will likely be too much for oilier hair types.      </li>
            <li> I have been relaxed for a long time now and have decided to transition to be natural.</li>
            <li> after the first use, it was the missing ingredient that we needed in order to get my hair looking like I had just stepped out of the salon.  </li>
            <li> But maybe I was using it wrong due to others having good comments.</li>
            <li> That new conditioner made my hair so dry and tangled that when I finally finished untangling I had about 2 fist fulls of hair on the floor.</li>
            <li> It did nothing for this 4a color treated, natural, dry hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: Now that I&#x27;m 100% natural, it doesn&#x27;t work as well as some other conditioners to clump my curls.</li>
            <li> So in need of a desperate repair, I turned back to my tried and true ORS Replenishing Conditioner and it restored my hair back to it&#x27;s natural softness, bounciness, and moisture.</li>
            <li> I use this about 2-3 times a month because I alternate with other deep conditioners but this happens to be one of my favorites along with the ORS Nourishing Conditioner (I use this one as an instant conditioner; leave in for 3-5 minutes)</li>
            <li> Having super porous hair, it usually dries in a flash, but after this, it took ages to dry- which shows me that the protein really did its just in filling in the weak parts of the strands.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from dry hair and it restores moisturize into my hair instantly.  </li>
            <li> As I am a hair-journeying near product-junky sort of gal, I did use the products as directed, and they did not balance each other out in the way I would expect products from the same line to balance each other out.</li>
            <li> I tried so hard not to purchase this conditioner in a large size bottle</li>
            <li> I got a shower filter in hopes that that would help, but it was only a minimal difference.  </li>
            <li> But as long as they make it I&#x27;m going to continue to use it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sometimes I will put this on my hair and rub it into my roots and sleep with it on all night long.  </li>
            <li> in the bath not as long as recommended.</li>
            <li> My hair has been so dry due to chemicals, and age (lots of grey mixed in which is wirey).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend leaving this conidtioner, or any conditioner, in your hair for a very long time because it will dry your hair out.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> My hair was dry and felt like chalky straw.</li>
            <li> Nothing got rid of that chalky, dry feeling.</li>
            <li> , my hair felt dry.</li>
            <li> Also it prevents my hair from going dry.</li>
            <li> I shampoo infrequently because my hair is so dry.</li>
            <li> This does have protein in it, but when I was starting my hair journey a few years back, I managed to over-condition</li>
            <li> This is for everyone with dry hair, no matter race!</li>
            <li> before i apply the deep conditioner, my hair feels a little dry because i shampoo it.</li>
            <li> I have unruly, very dry hair.</li>
            <li> The only bad experience I&#x27;ve ever had with another brand was with dark and lovely [gave me straw hair].</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a white girl with thick, coarse, dry, wavy/curly blond hair.</li>
            <li> and so I have two completely different textures that are very fragile and hard to manage.</li>
            <li> Beware, this is not your standard conditioner that you put on your hair while washing it and then rinse after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I now use it as an ingredient for a diy conditioner mix I apply daily to my hair for the Green House Effect Method.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To use this product, I wet my hair, and then apply it; I leave it in overnight, and then rinse it you.</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s the citron that makes my hair rough</li>
            <li> However, there is absolutely no conditioning offered.</li>
            <li> Her hair when wet is down to her waist, when dry it is shoulder length.</li>
            <li> I was sooo frustrated that I was even considering chopping it off and going natural or something, and I&#x27;ve got pretty long hair [a little longer than bra stap length].</li>
            <li> The other brand left my hair dry and hard to manage.</li>
            <li> ,add very little styling prod(SM  souffle mixed with smoothie/</li>
            <li> I use this ever 3 weeks, or every other week when needed.  </li>
            <li> For the longest time, I was buying the small replenishing packs and using it every time I washed my hair, but I finally realized that I needed to buy a bottle!</li>
            <li> A pity!</li>
            <li> Rinse it out EXTREMELY well.&lt;br /&gt;Just &#x27;</li>
            <li> It contains parabens and silicones, along other chemical ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have 4c relaxed hair, relaxed means broken bonds, and I&#x27;m African American, so I need tons of moisture.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s such a rarity for my dull hair color and the dryness did not help at all.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick dry frizzy but fragile hair and this conditioner has made all the difference.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair moisturized WITHOUT weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Hands down</li>
            <li> hands down*, as of the time of this writing.</li>
            <li> In addition my hair feels oily and weighed down after use no matter</li>
            <li> She is mixed with black and white and has medium to thin hair with tight small curls.</li>
            <li> Black women, this is the difference...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black woman with thick,coarse hair.</li>
            <li> In my previous review I had used the conditioner as is for a couple of months.</li>
            <li> I order by half dozen and cheaper on line than in stores.</li>
            <li> I have been battling dry hair off and on for a while now due to going to school in areas with very hard water, but when I moved to go to an out-of-state school (harder water, still, in Miami), my hair seemed irreparable.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t not able to run my wide tooth comb through my hair with the product in.</li>
            <li> But I bought it in a little pack for less than $2, so I figure what</li>
            <li> and it comes with this conditioner in a little &amp;#34;pak&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I TAKE A LITTLE AND PUT IN MY HAIR</li>
            <li> It was so dry that I had to completely give up blow drying, my hair was falling like crazy when I combed it because it was so brittle and</li>
            <li> I like a lot) and the Replenishing Conditioner also comes in a PROFESSIONAL FORMULA but may be a little difficult to find(can find on Amazon) and cost around $15 for 32ozs.</li>
            <li> Now it just seems to make my hair dull and not very moisturized.</li>
            <li> This conditioner seems to stop working after a few uses.</li>
            <li> It conditions and moisturizes your hair without being too harsh.</li>
            <li> So tired of trying prods and driving back to return em&#x27;...</li>
            <li> i also think it caused a few pimples on my scalp.</li>
            <li> It will feel heavy and oily.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replenish my lackluster hair and it leaves my hair filmy and heavy.</li>
            <li> her hair usually looks like a frizzy mess after sleeping on it, but when i use this (i don&#x27;t use shampoo on her</li>
            <li> Strengthened, moisturized and tame-</li>
            <li> After I rinsed and blow dried, the difference was unbelievable.</li>
            <li> It is watery and not very effective.</li>
            <li> Plus my little curls were so well defined!</li>
            <li> I am not sure how I came upon this product.  </li>
            <li> My hair is past my bra clip.</li>
            <li> I usually get it around home in the ethnic hair sections of stores.</li>
            <li> so I bought a small foil pack from my beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> I usually need to add moisture after adding protein, but I found this provided a balance of both.  </li>
            <li> I usually put it in and rinse it out after 5 minutes followed by a hair mask like matrix or Alter ego coconut and Shea mask.</li>
            <li> I am probably the very very few that this product didn&#x27;t work for.</li>
            <li> Me on the other hand, I have thin hair, and strive for thickness.</li>
            <li> I usually go to the salon, but times are hard and  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to rinse out</li>
            <li> Too bad you can&#x27;t get these results with an all natural product.  </li>
            <li> Be careful, because as silly as it sounds you can over moisturize.  </li>
            <li> I must use this at least once a month to prevent dryness.</li>
            <li> I use the Replenishing Conditioner for at least 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> Her hair is already thick</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and she has course curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have locs, and I was hesitant to try (what I remembered to be) a thick conditioner.</li>
            <li> Oh well - small sacrifice!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing the GHE method for the past couple of months and now my hair is FIERCE!.</li>
            <li> I realize that organic is just the name and it means nothing to them, but it does mean something to me.</li>
            <li> I suffer from Atopic Dermatitis and sometimes my scalp can get so dry that my hair suffers the consequences.  </li>
            <li> My scalp was flaking like crazy due to all of the dryness</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewer that it stinks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a citric scent, and there is research behind aromas that prove that citric smells improve concentration; so you might want to apply it in the mornings before heading to work or on weekend evenings before going out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Disappointed, because I expected an organic product.</li>
            <li> I was considering investing in  expensive flatirons</li>
            <li> Possibly the worst \\&quot;conditioner\\&quot; ever.</li>
            <li> But my hair feels weird</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a weird substance</li>
            <li> If you have dry hair, give this a try, you wont be disappointed!!!!</li>
            <li> I have seen a dramatic improvement in my hair and so has everyone else!</li>
            <li> I was so unhappy with my hair</li>
            <li> Very scary and misleading</li>
            <li> all the rave about this shampoo I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> (so if you hate oranges, you might want to stay away.  </li>
            <li> and I hate using shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Terrible smell and bad feel on hair after rinse.</li>
            <li> I hated this conditioner, never again.</li>
            <li> Dreadful nasty stuff.</li>
            <li> It was absolutely horrible.</li>

            <li> Pair it with the serum and it works wonders!</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel too greasy</li>
            <li> Oh this conditioner is the best ever, it leaves my hair very soft, and smells beautiful. I just want to keep using it</li>
            <li> For hair that is damaged, dry, and out of control this product really brings it back to life. Worth the money!</li>
            <li> I have not used it yet for the same reason I did not used the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like to be forced to write so many words. I already don&#x27;t like to spend my time giving reviews for YOUR benefit.</li>
            <li> This is a great conditioner. It kind of smells citrusy. I only used it on my ends and i was satisfeid. This will be one of my staple products.</li>
            <li> I am a pj which is a product junkie so I have just about tried everything in the book,and very choosy what I like and don&#x27;t like but when I came across this olive oil replenishing paks I fell in love with this stuff and it became a staple for me very good conditioner and does the hair very well.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! I have been wishing for it to come in a full sized bottle forever and now finally it does! I have lots of natural hair (huge afro) and I had to use atleast 2 sometime 3 replenishing pacs at a time. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you for the full sized bottle!!!</li>
            <li> I have 3c natural hair. I sit under a dryer for 30 mins and rinse.This conditioner leaves my hair soft but it also makes it look oily and feeling coated. I reccomend Ogx argan oil deep conditioner . ive tried all kinds of deep conditioners. Cheap and high priced. Ogx (blue bottle) cannot be messed with as far as retaining moisture</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of years. I&#x27;ve been bouncing between relaxers, weaves, short straight cuts, and everything in between. This has become my go to conditioner. It leaves my hair soft enough to feel good, but not so limp that I can&#x27;t do anything with it. It works on all textures in my family. My mother has very coarse hair and uses it, my grandmother and aunt have very fine hair, and they like it as well. I don&#x27;t recommend leaving this conidtioner, or any conditioner, in your hair for a very long time because it will dry your hair out. I like to sit under the dryer with a shower cap for about 15-30 minutes, and rinse. It&#x27;s helped with tangles in weave and in my real hair, and I&#x27;ve used it to soften up my hair while removing braids. Definitely a 5-star product.</li>
            <li> Made my hair stiff,sorry but not for me</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair so much more softer than any other conditioner I have used in the past. Also the state my chemically treated hair has improved tremendously.</li>
            <li> My hair was very dry from color and perm and this product worked better than any I had tried in the past.</li>
            <li> Occasionally, I would apply coconut oil to moisturize my brittle hair but someone once told me to incorporate olive oil treatments to my hair regimen and my hair will improve.  I suffer from Atopic Dermatitis and sometimes my scalp can get so dry that my hair suffers the consequences.  I decided to give this product a try along with the Mane N Tail Shampoo/Conditioner/Detangler (for my method see my review on those products) which I purchased the same day.  These products compliment and work together really well.  My hair is now softer, EVEN shinier like when I was a kid - before I started messing with hair products.  Since I am trying to grow my hair longer, at least five inches more as noted in my other reviews, I am taking Biotin which I upgraded to 5000mcg a day.  Started Biotin this spring 2010,RD and my hair has grown considerably.  Cheers.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how I came upon this product.  Probably one of the many products my girlfriend was trying out when she was studying to be a cosmotologist.  I have to say, after the first use, it was the missing ingredient that we needed in order to get my hair looking like I had just stepped out of the salon.  Now it is a staple in my hair regime.  I mix it with Pantene smooth and straight, sit under the hair dryer for 1/2 hour and then finish up with olive oil (just a dime size) glosser.  That with one a day vitamins has helped my hair tremendously.  I recently tried the relaxer and it did not disappoint.  Not too strong not to light.  I luv, love it.</li>
            <li> This conditioner seems to stop working after a few uses. Now it just seems to make my hair dull and not very moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have been battling dry hair off and on for a while now due to going to school in areas with very hard water, but when I moved to go to an out-of-state school (harder water, still, in Miami), my hair seemed irreparable.  It was so dry that I had to completely give up blow drying, my hair was falling like crazy when I combed it because it was so brittle and no amount of oil (natural or store purchased)or moisturizing sheen seemed to help.  My scalp was flaking like crazy due to all of the dryness and I couldn&#x27;t find relief.  I had done everything I could.  I got a shower filter in hopes that that would help, but it was only a minimal difference.  I used the best conditioners, like Matrix Biolage conditioning balm and even resorted to homemade treatments like avocado and banana preshampoo masks, but nothing moisturized enough.  Many things would make my hair soft for a day or two, but it was still bone dry!      This is the ONLY product that actually gave me my hair back!! I can see a difference after one use and I have slip again!  I combed my hair out with no tangles for once!  I was able to actually do a good job on my roller wrap because my hair wasn&#x27;t drying out before I could even section it off before beginning.  This stuff is AMAZING!  My hair was soft, smooth, and even SHINY!  That&#x27;s such a rarity for my dull hair color and the dryness did not help at all.  Check the ingredients, it&#x27;s all about the natural oils.  After conditioning, your hair looks and feels like you&#x27;ve sprayed it with a light sheen because it&#x27;s so soft and smooth.  Black women, this is the difference...this is why we need products made for us and by us because many people try and just don&#x27;t understand black hair needs.  I&#x27;m so glad this is now sold in a full size bottle!!  I was seriously considering spending $40 on Alter Ego (which IS very good - shea and coconut worked wonders for me at my local salon), but now I don&#x27;t need to!!    If you have fine, oily, or mix textured hair (as in you are biracial), you may want to try the pack first.  This conditioner is heavily based from natural oils that will likely be too much for oilier hair types.      Con: the orange-y smell from the orange oil is a bit much (smells like orange Ozium air freshener), but somewhat refreshing at the same time, if that makes any sense at all</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product. I am probably the very very few that this product didn&#x27;t work for. I decided to get this conditioner based off all of the good reviews. Once I shampooed I used the conditioner soon as I put it in my hair I didn&#x27;t get that slip I was hoping for and is was like I put a shampoo on really. I decided to continue to use it but I was still getting the same results. So I will not be using this conditioner anymore.</li>
            <li> If there is one conditioner you need to use for relaxed hair, this is definitely it. I have used this product directly after a relaxer and it has left my hair feeling strengthened after all that processing. I also use ORS Replenishing conditioner as just before I wash my hair (mixing it with EVOO) to help reduce breakage when shampooing. I can find it at my local BSS on sale for $5, but even at $8 its a steal!</li>
            <li> I used after bleach my hair is very good</li>
            <li> I never write reviews however I tried this product today, it really works.I usually go to the salon, but times are hard and  sometimes I have to do it myself.I&#x27;m a black woman with thick,coarse hair.I sat under the dryer for 30 minutes and like magic it made it soft.</li>
            <li> This was a good product that worked well on my 3c/4a hair, but I cannot use this product more than once a month. It leaves my hair dry and brittle. I don&#x27;t know, maybe my hair doesn&#x27;t like much protein.    I&#x27;d recommend that you use it once every 2 or 3 months.    Overall rating: 3.0</li>
            <li> Wow works really well makes my hair so soft, and smell so good, like citrus! I heated my turby in microwave for 30 seconds put that on until it cooled! Amazing!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner for 6 months now. I have to say it is the best conditioner I have ever used. It leaves my hair moisturized WITHOUT weighing it down. This is a great moisturizer for African American hair. Also I am not going to tell everyone to buy this product because your hair may be a different type/texture then mine and please do not tell people not to buy a product because it did not work for YOUR hair.</li>
            <li> I love using this conditioner. It smells like lemons or oranges and i feel it working everytime i use it. After shampooing with the creamy aloe shampoo i condition for fifteen minutes under the dryer like it says to do. i rinse and then i use the glosser and/or wrap lotion that ORS sells. i think the finished result is well worth the price. I use almost all of ORS hair products and i havent been to the hair salon in six months. My hair looks great and im always getting compliments. I love it and so does my hair :)</li>
            <li> keeps my hair completely moisturized. there&#x27;s just one thing... I NEED A BIGGER BOTTLE! I have a lot of hair and I go through this really fast. I have to buy this product like two or three bottles at a time.</li>
            <li> Save your money. Dreadful nasty stuff. I used once and threw the remainder in the trash. Terrible smell and bad feel on hair after rinse.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is AWESOME. First off it comes in a decently sized bottle and you only need a little bit to achieve maximum results! This makes your hair feel so silky and smooth. It conditions and moisturizes your hair without being too harsh. ORS has hit it out of the park on this one! Best conditioner ever!</li>
            <li> I was buying this product before the ingredients changed, so I can tell the difference. It still works okay but I remember I loved both the orange scent and the moisture I felt before and after washing the product out.  I won&#x27;t be surprised if the ingredients change again since this brand use not so high quality of ingredients (sulfates, petrolatum, etc.). So, I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been natural for almost 4 years now, and as much as I&#x27;ve wanted to stray away from all chemicals, this treatment is like a drug to me!  I absolutely loveeee this!  I usually apply and go under a hot cap for about 15 minutes, what I am left with is soft, shiney, moisturized hair.  Be careful, because as silly as it sounds you can over moisturize.  I use this ever 3 weeks, or every other week when needed.  It works just as much now as it did a few years ago when I first started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the amount of chemical additives.  Too bad you can&#x27;t get these results with an all natural product.  Oh well - small sacrifice!</li>
            <li> I use the olive oil relaxer and always loved the replenishing pack it came with. My local target recently increased the price of the perm. Me being cheap, I decided to give another perm a try. I&#x27;ve used Dr. Miracles and gentle treatment with no problem, but I&#x27;ve always loved olive oil. The only bad experience I&#x27;ve ever had with another brand was with dark and lovely [gave me straw hair]. So, I go and pick up the new motions shine relaxer and give it a try. BIGGEST mistake of my life. DONT EVER USE THAT PERM!!!...My hair was dry and felt like chalky straw. I&#x27;ve NEVER had my hair feel like that before. I washed my hair and conditioned it with my own stuff, added deep conditioners and everything. Nothing got rid of that chalky, dry feeling. I was sooo frustrated that I was even considering chopping it off and going natural or something, and I&#x27;ve got pretty long hair [a little longer than bra stap length]. I decided to wait a day and buy the bottle version of the replenishing pack that was part of the olive oil relaxer. It saved the day!!!...i put it in, put a shower cap on for an hour, and it gave me my hair back. It was smooth, silky, and soft. I was scared that my hair would never gain back its integrity, but I&#x27;m SOOOO glad that they made a bottle version of this stuff. I will NEVER cheat on my olive oil perm again...its worth the extra 2 dollars..and this product is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Only really works for me if I leave it for in a bit, but then does and my hair is super dry. Then again this is first conditioner I have really tried leaving in so no idea if this one is special or not.</li>
            <li> The whole olive organic olive oil line is great but especially the conditioner. I have very thick dry frizzy but fragile hair and this conditioner has made all the difference. It truely restores moisture to your hair and especially good if u have damaged hair. I now can straighen my hair and it looks wonderful. I was considering investing in  expensive flatirons and i do not have to becasue the process of straightening my hair is tht much easier. I have never used a product that has had such good results with my hair. I have seen a dramatic improvement in my hair and so has everyone else!</li>
            <li> This product has definitely been a God-send for my relaxed hair.  It&#x27;s a protein/moisturizing mix that smells like oranges (so if you hate oranges, you might want to stay away.  I will say the smell doesn&#x27;t linger though.)  I put some on, deep condition with a shower cap under my bonnet dryer for 15 minutes and rinse out.  My hair feels amazing AND it detangle so easily.    Be aware that they rejiggered some of the ingredients recently (if you have the new designed bottle seen here, it&#x27;s probably the new formula.)  So you might want to purchase one of the packs before you decide to buy a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> Before I went natural I was using this conditioner and it&#x27;s okay. It did leave my hair soft and moisturized, on top of that I would use the Organic Root Hair Lotion for more manageability. Haven&#x27;t tried yet since going natural, hmmmm maybe I will. A good conditioner and will recommend.</li>
            <li> Im post relaxer(12 weeks)...Natural with permanent hair color..its been a trial trying product after product that could detangle and moisturize this hair after rinsing(esp my new growth)..This stuffs heaven sent!!..FANTASTIC SLIP!..I will be simply deep cond/co washing with this product ONLY..I finally finger/comb thru my hair.,add very little styling prod(SM  souffle mixed with smoothie/the coconut oil in it softens wonderfully) rod my hair(light handed with Denman).,next morning my hair never felt so conditioned!!!!...So tired of trying prods and driving back to return em&#x27;...I got this at Sallys for $7...No need for me to become a prod junkie since ive finally discovered something that conditions thoroughly and tames those puffy roots!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for good conditioners for my dry hair. I used this conditioner for the first time, and I can honestly say it&#x27;s great.  I washed my hair and applied this product and sat under my hooded dryer for 30 minutes.  When I rinsed it out of my hair, my hair felt like silk.  After blowdrying and flatironing my hair feels so soft. So this will now be one of my staple products.  Now on the other hand, my best friend used this product and says it left her hair feeling very thick and coated.  Her hair is already thick so that&#x27;s the last thing she needs. Me on the other hand, I have thin hair, and strive for thickness. So obviously it works for some and not for others.  But as long as they make it I&#x27;m going to continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this same conditioner for years with no complaints. It is the only conditioner I use. Very highly recommended</li>
            <li> Beware, this is not your standard conditioner that you put on your hair while washing it and then rinse after a few minutes. Supposedly, you have to keep it on for half an hour or more, it&#x27;s an entire production...  So I would not recommend it, unless you actually want to spend 30-45 minutes with it in your hair, then wash it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at my local beauty store after having shedding uncontrollably i was so happy i put it in after shampooing my hair and covered with a plastic cap no heat for 45mins and my hair has stop shedding i have using it for 3weeks now this 1 is a keeper. ps its light protein too</li>
            <li> I do not shampoo my hair unless I do a cayenne pepper olive oil treatment and then I have to but with this stuff I will get up, rub it into my hair.  My hair is past my bra clip. Leave it on for 15 minutes or all night sometimes and then take a shower and use nexis conditioner and I have the healthiest hair ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is not dry, grows fast and I hate using shampoo.  This stuff is great.  I usually get it around home in the ethnic hair sections of stores. I have Caucasian hair so people are surprised I use this stuff but it is great and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I will put this on my hair and rub it into my roots and sleep with it on all night long.  Then I just rinse it out and condition it.  It does way more than any other shampoo or conditioner has ever done for my hair.</li>
            <li> Even as a blonde woman with curly hair I find this product to work like a dream!</li>
            <li> I can only say that this product is excellent. This is the first review that I have ever written on Amazon and it is fitting that it should go to this product. My hair is natural and gray. It was shedding everywhere. I used this product and my hair is actually soft and manageable. Let me tell you I have unruly, very dry hair. This conditioner allows me to pull a comb through my hair.   Thanks  a million.</li>
            <li> I haved used this product for three years now and have thought about just ordering a large tub of this because it&#x27;s a part of my hair routine. After I use it, I deep condition with a moisturizer (I use Eden Bodyworks deep conditioner) and these two combined work great on wash days.</li>
            <li> I just love the way it makes my hair feel.  I use it every day along with the shampoo. a</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a white girl with thick, coarse, dry, wavy/curly blond hair. This is, without a doubt, the best conditioner I have ever used for my hair. It is heavy and very moisturizing, enough so that if I use it with a sulfate-free shampoo I can actually get away without using any product when I get out of the shower (that would have been absolutely UNHEARD OF before trying this). It&#x27;d probably be too greasy if you have thin or not-dry hair, but for me it&#x27;s perfect. Highly recommended. Smells citrusy.</li>
            <li> I have been relaxed for a long time now and have decided to transition to be natural. I used this product when I was relaxed mainly because it came in the Olive Oil relaxer kit and didn&#x27;t think twice about it. Now that I am paying more attention to my hair I continued to use it and loved the way it made my hair feel. I recently ran out of the product and decided to try out another product (if you must know it was the Shea Moisture Deep Conditioning Masque.) That new conditioner made my hair so dry and tangled that when I finally finished untangling I had about 2 fist fulls of hair on the floor. The dryness that that product caused lasted all week. It was absolutely horrible. So in need of a desperate repair, I turned back to my tried and true ORS Replenishing Conditioner and it restored my hair back to it&#x27;s natural softness, bounciness, and moisture. I will never deviate from it again! Ever! ORS for LIFE!</li>
            <li> I tried so hard not to purchase this conditioner in a large size bottle so I first purchased the paks to use. This conditioner works okay and smells like tangerines. I gave it four stars because I didn&#x27;t notice a HUGE difference in my hair but it did leave it soft and smelling good. I have 4a-c, very coily, thin, fine hair.  I typically alternate my protein and moisture deep conditioning treatments each week, which works exceptionally well for my hair. I currently use a FABULOUS protein deep conditioner so I want my moisture deep conditioner to give me the same FABULOUS results.  But I will keep it in mind for future use because it&#x27;s pretty inexpensive and can be found most anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/26/13 UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner is NOT a MOISTURE deep conditioner but a LIGHT PROTEIN conditioner with very good moisturizing ingredients. So it&#x27;s possible to leave on your hair a bit longer than prescribed on the bottle or even over night. In my previous review I had used the conditioner as is for a couple of months. I now use it as an ingredient for a diy conditioner mix I apply daily to my hair for the Green House Effect Method. I&#x27;ve been doing the GHE method for the past couple of months and now my hair is FIERCE!. Another point I would like to make is the Hair Mayonnaise is a MEDIUM PROTEIN deep conditioner(which I like a lot) and the Replenishing Conditioner also comes in a PROFESSIONAL FORMULA but may be a little difficult to find(can find on Amazon) and cost around $15 for 32ozs. BTW, I still alternate between moisture and protein dc&#x27;s week to week and have recently found a FABULOUS moisture deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner I have ever used.  Great smell.  Softens hair and makes it easier to comb.  Easy to handle and no stickiness.</li>
            <li> I used to just buy the olive oil packs for hair, but I figured that-- as much as I love the product-- I may as well just buy a whole container to save money.  It smells really good (almost like oranges) and it makes my curly hair manageable and soft.  I would totally recommend this as a deep conditioner-- I distribute the product throughout all of my hair and put on a shower cap for about an hour to let it soak in.</li>
            <li> This review is for the PRODUCT, not the shipper.  I had no problems with the shipper but I do not care so much for the product itself.  I thought that I would try this products because of the transitioning process that I am experiencing while going natural and I do not believe that I will be purchasing this product again.  Trial and error I suppose.  After using it, my hair does not feel as if is any different then when I started the washing process.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my toddlers curly hair because it said &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;. After using it on her she broke out into hives so I decided to research it on the SkinDeep database (that researches and reviews all skin care products and rates their danger levels and this had a 10 out of 10. Major red flag!). I will be returning it for a refund. Very scary and misleading and I will be seeing how I can raise awareness about this. Organic is not just a label they can use so freely because many people take it very seriously.</li>
            <li> 5 Stars for a great product! Amazon Amazing! I loved it! Great Product that met my needs and a great ordering experience!</li>
            <li> This conditioner works great and puts a really good slip into hair so that it&#x27;s easier to comb out tangles and it leaves some oil behind after rinsing so it feels smooth and conditioned. I must use this at least once a month to prevent dryness.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner! It never fails me, but I now have a problem, I bleached my hair and the first day I bleached it I was so unhappy with my hair and I used this conditioner and it gave me so much moisture and slip and so much shine but unfortunately  I have not used it since and even though I get so many compliments on the color, I have so much dryness. I read all the great reviews on the aussie 3 minute miracle and I so wanted to try it- total bummer! It did nothing for this 4a color treated, natural, dry hair. I am going back to this conditioner and I will tell you all what I think when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> before i went natural, i use to perm my hair with the ORS perm and it had a pack of this conditioner in it. i didn&#x27;t really know what it did for my hair but i did know that it smelt really good. it smell like citrus fruits. now that i&#x27;m natural, i can actually feel the difference in my hair of before using this and after. before i apply the deep conditioner, my hair feels a little dry because i shampoo it. but once i apply the conditioner and let it sit for 45 minutes, then wash it out. my hair feels so moisturized. it leaves my hair feeling super soft, shiny, and just  so moisturized. but i don&#x27;t use this conditioner every time i wash my hair because it is a light protein conditioner.</li>
            <li> i love it, my hair stays soooo soft after each use, less frizz, more body and did i mention soft? not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend told me about this conditioner so I bought a small foil pack from my beauty supply store. WOW - what a great product! I had been using another fabulous conditioner (Pantene Fortifying Fortifier) but it is getting more difficult to find. I am transitioning from relaxed to natural (curly) hair and so I have two completely different textures that are very fragile and hard to manage. I shampooed my hair normally, put the whole Root Stimulator pack on my hair, covered with a plastic cap and towel and went about my business for an hour. No heat was necessary. When I removed the cap, my hair was so soft and smelled great - like a light orange sorbet. Plus my little curls were so well defined! After I rinsed and blow dried, the difference was unbelievable. I highly recommend this conditioner and fully intend to stock up on it. The price is right and the results are amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Now that I&#x27;m 100% natural, it doesn&#x27;t work as well as some other conditioners to clump my curls. For some reason, it&#x27;s not as easy for me to comb this conditioner through as it was when the ends were still straight. I still highly recommend it for transitioners but as for all natural girls and guys, there are better products out there for us.</li>
            <li> I have found my staple deep conditioner!  I was extremely happy how this made my hair feel, it was soft and made my hair very manageable.  I suffer from dry hair and it restores moisturize into my hair instantly.  I do mix with an additional oil just for the sake of it, but overall I do love the results of this product and definitely a must have in my regime!</li>
            <li> I have a mixed child, age 4, female. She is mixed with black and white and has medium to thin hair with tight small curls. Her hair when wet is down to her waist, when dry it is shoulder length. I had been using childrens products (shampoo, leave in conditioner, detangler, etc) but these products were doing their jobs but not making the hair healthier or more manageable. I bought this product as a sample to try and oh my god it is amazing. Her hair soaked it up. After leaving it on her hair for awhile and then rinsing it out, it seemed as if there was nothing left on the hair to rinse out. It made her hair softer, easier to comb and shinier. Lovin it. I&#x27;m awaiting the shampoo to complete the treatment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for awhile, because I use the Olive Oil relaxed kit and it comes with this conditioner in a little &amp;#34;pak&amp;#34;. I never knew it came in a bottle until I went to Wal-Mart one day and seen it; I immediately grabbed it! I love the way it makes my hair feel and it gives so much slip. I use this about 2-3 times a month because I alternate with other deep conditioners but this happens to be one of my favorites along with the ORS Nourishing Conditioner (I use this one as an instant conditioner; leave in for 3-5 minutes) I use the Replenishing Conditioner for at least 45 minutes. This is also a great light protein conditioner. It gives both protein and moisture to your hair. I recommend this to people who are really protein sensitive because it gives a little protein with a good amount of moisture</li>
            <li> i have fine, wavy hair. this is just too weighty for my hair, doesn&#x27;t really work for me. i also think it caused a few pimples on my scalp. but for my daughter&#x27;s frizzy, curly hair it works GREAT. her hair usually looks like a frizzy mess after sleeping on it, but when i use this (i don&#x27;t use shampoo on her, i just wash her hair with this conditioner) she wakes up with more curls than frizz. and it seems the more i use it, the better her hair is in general.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. I love what it does to my hair. Soft and manageble. Will buy this again.</li>
            <li> After reading all these wonderful reviews, I started wondering was it only for African American hair? I just saw it in the store and bought it, used it today and LOVED IT!  My hair is soft, silky and hydrated!  My hair has been so dry due to chemicals, and age (lots of grey mixed in which is wirey). This really did the trick, even after just one use! I left it on for 45 minutes with a towel wrapped around my hair. I could tell when rinsing it out that it was different. This is for everyone with dry hair, no matter race! If you have dry hair, give this a try, you wont be disappointed!!!!</li>
            <li> Organic Root Stimulator KUDOS! This is a moisture/protein balanced deep conditioner and I love this on my relaxed fine hair. My hair always comes silky and uber soft. This is a great product to use weekly.</li>
            <li> I settled for Aussie moist sweep condish for months until I found this in my moms closet. Very moisturizing. But next week I&#x27;ll try kinky curly leave in and compare the two.</li>
            <li> Wow.made my hair extremely soft n manageable.great scent also.gave my hair that immediate shine.</li>
            <li> I had fine, brittle, damaged hair. I started using this product and it left my hair soft and manageable. When using this product make sure you wash it all out because it will leave a residue on your hair. It will feel heavy and oily. But overall great product!</li>
            <li> A hairdresser told me to use a full line of products to achieve maximum benefits of the product line. Because I liked [[ASIN:B003YELGF2 Organic Root Stimulator Hair Mayonnaise Treatment, 16 Ounce]] I bought[[ASIN:B000EGIFBQ Organic Olive Oil Creamy Aloe Shampoo, 12.5 Ounce]] and this product. After shampooing my hair still had moisture. After applying this product... my hair felt stripped liked I shampooed it again. I agree with the other reviewer that it stinks. It also is not organic. I realize that organic is just the name and it means nothing to them, but it does mean something to me. So I will not buy this anymore and I wont buy this line any more.</li>
            <li> I accidentally used this conditioner after getting a perm by the same brand. It worked so well, I had to get some more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use this product, I wet my hair, and then apply it; I leave it in overnight, and then rinse it you. I then apply some more, and then leave it in while I soak; I then rinse again and style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I deep condition every weekend and even more so when I perm/relax my hair!</li>
            <li> OK  but not what I need for my hair.....I do love the Olive Oil shampoo tho.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like it. But maybe I was using it wrong due to others having good comments.</li>
            <li> THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST CONDITIONER! DEF TOP NOTCH COMPAIRED TO ANY SALON BRANDS THAT I HAVE USED. I SOMETIMES USE THIS AS A DEEP CONDITIONER! IT DOES NOT WEIGH MY HAIR DOWN AND MAKES IT MORE MANAGEABLE!</li>
            <li> I use this on a weekly basis to deep condition my hair. I can honestly say after using this product for the last three months I have noticed a huge difference..People  think I went to the hairdresser every time I use it.To do a comparison I tried another brand deep conditioner treatment and I did not get the same results. The other brand left my hair dry and hard to manage.What I like the most is after I wash it out and blow dry, my hair has a lot of body and looks healthy&lt;br /&gt;(perm box pretty lol). I would like to add that I have a relaxer and somehow this product has help me stretch out my retouch to about twelve weeks.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine (though I have a mountain of it), curly, dry and very porous.  It tangles easily and gets weighed down easily with richer oils.  I&#x27;ve used these paks for years while constantly dying my hair, so while it probably helped reduce damage, I did not see the results that I am seeing now as I continue on my healing, healthy hair journey (that is a mouthful!).  I am hooked and I will be very upset if my hair stops responding well to this, or they (gasp!) discontinue it.  It only took a handful to coat my hair (I am used to using 1/4 or 1/2 a bottle sometimes to get through all of my hair) and left it on freshly washed hair overnight (plastic wrap and a fashionable twistie turban :)  My hair just drank this up!  In the morning when washing out, my hair felt strong and silky- impressive.  I usually need to add moisture after adding protein, but I found this provided a balance of both.  Having super porous hair, it usually dries in a flash, but after this, it took ages to dry- which shows me that the protein really did its just in filling in the weak parts of the strands.  My hair had no tangles to rat out, and my curls were so soft and well-defined.  The ends of my hair felt and looked substantially stronger and thicker than before the treatment.  Oh, and I loooove the smell!  It is a VERY vibrant orange scent- strong, but it is a scent that agrees with my nose and I could not smell it when wrapped up, so it did not interfere with my beauty rest.  Citrus oil, limonene, and linalool are all ingredients towards the top of the list, and I believe the citrus oil and its derivatives are responsible for soothing down the cuticle of the hair.  Strengthened, moisturized and tame- If you have hair that sounds like mine- try it.</li>
            <li> all i have in terms of this conditioner is it really works on my hair type! I have naturally curly hair that i have relaxed a month ago and i&#x27;m currently trying to grow my hair but in a healthy way and this conditioner leaves my hair moisturized and soft! with a nice tangerine scent!! Its awesome! Hands down</li>
            <li> THIS CONDITIONER IS SO GOOD ...IT SMELLS LIKE FRESH ORANGES...IT LEAVES MY HAIR SO SOFT ...MY HAIR IS NATURAL AND IT MAKES MY HAIR SO SOFT AND BEAUTIFUL EVEN IN ITS NATURAL STATE...I TAKE A LITTLE AND PUT IN MY HAIR AS A LEAVE IN CONDITIONER..MY HAIR LOVES IT...IT SMELLS SO GOOD AND MY HAIR FEELS AMAZING!!!!</li>
            <li> This conditioner along with it&#x27;s shampoo are two items I use together.&lt;br /&gt;They help keep my hair soft and easy to manage. They are reasonable priced on line.</li>
            <li> I have tried this conditioner for the first time today and OMG HEAVEN I am currently 9 weeks post transitioning to natural and this is the best conditioner I have ever tried in a very loooong time made both textures of my hair very soft and manageable and I can comb my hair with no tangles I will definitely buy it again I will get the bigger bottle next time because I like to use a lot to coat my hair and I keep it on for an hour to really let it sink in if you haven&#x27;t tried you should you have nothing to lose!</li>
            <li> Love love love this product. Timely shipping. This product makes my hair so soft and manageable. Since I&#x27;ve been using it, my bleached TWA has shown so much improvement. I will continue to order this!!! Highly recommend it to those with dry brittle hair.</li>
            <li> Possibly the worst \\&quot;conditioner\\&quot; ever. So I used a shampoo which completely stripped my hair. Completely.. this conditioner is my mother&#x27;s, and she&#x27;s loves it. She&#x27;s relaxed and I&#x27;m natural. I gave it a try, hoping it would bring back moisture to my hair. Not at all. As a conditioner, I expect moisture and then ability to detangle. I wasn&#x27;t not able to run my wide tooth comb through my hair with the product in. No matter how much I saturated my hair with the conditioner it would just not allowed my comb through. Even after I used my Tresemme conditioner, which have me the slip and moisture I yearn, my hair felt dry. Only  reason why I have it 2 stars and not 1(since I can&#x27;t give no stars) is because of the awesome orangey smell and the consistency of the conditioner. But still not enough for three stars. I hated this conditioner, never again.</li>
            <li> This product is my favorite conditioner. I have 4c relaxed hair, relaxed means broken bonds, and I&#x27;m African American, so I need tons of moisture. This product does both of those in one bottle. I use this as a deep conditioner almost every wash day. It has a great balance of protein and moisture that does not turn my hair into a brittle or gummy mess. I use this when I am feeling fairly balanced, or leaning on the low-moisture side. This does have protein in it, but when I was starting my hair journey a few years back, I managed to over-condition my hair with this, meaning the moisture levels are much higher. Not to mention my low porosity hair, which needs a very specific level of protein to not feel brittle and dry.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I rated four is because recently I used this to DC after a deep protein treatment with ORS Mayo, and it did not help restore the moisture levels of my hair and balance the protein in the Mayo. The only reason I feel this is a problem is because they are from the same line and theoretically should work together. As I am a hair-journeying near product-junky sort of gal, I did use the products as directed, and they did not balance each other out in the way I would expect products from the same line to balance each other out. At any rate, do not use this to balance out moisture when you have entirely too much protein.&lt;br /&gt;Alone, though, this product is the best conditioner I have ever used, *hands down*, as of the time of this writing. If I could give it 4.6 or 4.9, I would.</li>
            <li> My sister uses this shampoo and conditioner and she loves it. I have thick curly hair and she has course curly hair. I have been using this for a month now and it has made me break out all along my hairline. In addition my hair feels oily and weighed down after use no matter how well I wash it out.after all the rave about this shampoo I am disappointed. I will be giving her the bottles and switching back to my old shampoo</li>
            <li> I like to rock a mini afro, and this conditioner makes my hair really soft. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I first used this conditioner when I switched to the ORS brand of relaxers. I really liked the smell and I think it did a good job of conditioning my hair after the rough treatment I put it through with relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;Then I transitioned to unrelaxed hair. I bought it a few times, and liked it, but I didn&#x27;t keep up with using it as I always wanted to try new products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have locs, and I was hesitant to try (what I remembered to be) a thick conditioner. But I bought it in a little pack for less than $2, so I figure what the heck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my pleasant surprise, it&#x27;s not as thick as I thought it was (I probably thought that because my hair is fine, and with locs I think I have a better sense of a product&#x27;s real consistency.)I&#x27;ve been deep conditioning with it since. I remember that great smell, and when I rinsed it out after leaving it in for more than an hour my locs felt plush, something I haven&#x27;t experience...since I&#x27;ve had them. Unless I find a better deep conditioner, (which I doubt, since it&#x27;s been good to my relaxed, loose and loc&#x27;d hair) this will be my staple. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this to replenish my lackluster hair and it leaves my hair filmy and heavy. Love the smell but thats about it. I won&#x27;t order again</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner it is part of my hair routine. It makes my hair so smooth and silky especially with the right shampoo. I usually put it in and rinse it out after 5 minutes followed by a hair mask like matrix or Alter ego coconut and Shea mask.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product once a week. It has softened my thinning,dry as well brittle hair. I leave it around 20 mins. in the bath not as long as recommended. It has helped to keep my hair detangled as well. It arrived promptly. The smell is more like a pledge smell instead of being naturally fragranced which could be improved with natural ingredients;);) Would purchase again if this change is made!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! For the longest time, I was buying the small replenishing packs and using it every time I washed my hair, but I finally realized that I needed to buy a bottle! I&#x27;ve tried other deep conditioners and this one is still my favorite. It smells wonderful, brings my curls back to life, and makes my hair feel so strong and manageable. I just can&#x27;t get enough of it!</li>
            <li> All the good reviews! But my hair feels weird, it&#x27;s a weird substance and I think it&#x27;s the citron that makes my hair rough and it actually falls out after using this stuff. Tried it twice and threw it away. A pity!</li>
            <li> Lovely smell of citrus and cleanliness that lingers well after the shower. However, there is absolutely no conditioning offered. It is watery and not very effective.</li>
            <li> combined with the shampoo this conditioner makes my hair feel as if it has never been eposed to color, spray or the&lt;br /&gt;elements. Love it</li>
            <li> This products natural ingredient are very concentrated that you can feel the smoothness they create when you cover you hair with it. I apply this conditioner and instead or removing it instantly, I start to apply Old Spice Fresh Collection body wash. That way I hold the conditioner on my hair enough time to get the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a citric scent, and there is research behind aromas that prove that citric smells improve concentration; so you might want to apply it in the mornings before heading to work or on weekend evenings before going out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is very compact that you can carry it anywhere or fit it between other shower products without fear that this bottle may fall in your bath tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does not contain parabens! Which is a substance that has been cataloged as a carcinogen. (Many hair/skin products are still using them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.D.This is a man reviewing this product</li>
            <li> I LOVE this condiioner. I have 3c curly hair that has been bleached 3 times.. I never used to take care of my hair and i&#x27;ve gone through countless products before encountering this jar of perfection. It softens and detangles my hair and gives it the moisture it needs. I use the Moisture Rentention Raw Shea butter shampoo with this conditioner and BAM my hair feels and looks sooo healthy. The only con is the scent.. Its not bad at all, its just a strong orange scent.. I kind of like it but its definatley not all that desirable to me. I highly reccommend this product :) THANK YOU ORS</li>
            <li> Cheaper than in store price. Works well and smells like it should. Great buy!</li>
            <li> not bad but not the best</li>
            <li> Best conditioner ever for chemically treated hair.  Absolutely amazing!!!  Been using it for years now!</li>
            <li> Smells, does nothing for my hair</li>
            <li> Organic is only in the name,  which is very misleading.  I should have also read the usage instructions which say it is a leave in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I tried using it as a regular conditioner and just wash it out in about 3 minutes in the shower and it burned my scalp.  I can only imagine what damage it would do if you left it in for the recomended 10, 15 or 45 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;My scalp felt like I rubbed it with a cleaning product or something similar,  I&#x27;ve never felt anything like that.  I will defenitely have to toss this one out.</li>
            <li> I simply love it. I was having more hair loss before using this product. But after I combined this product with Extra virgin Olive oil, my hair loss reduced greatly. Also it prevents my hair from going dry. Would certainly buy this again when the current one runs out.</li>
            <li> provides great slip but make sure you rinse all of it out or it will leave ur hair sticky after drying</li>
            <li> Okkkkk but nothing to write home about.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to rinse out and it&#x27;s a bit greasy and not all that conditioning.  Rinse it out EXTREMELY well.&lt;br /&gt;Just &#x27;ok.&#x27; PASS.</li>
            <li> This is a perfectly good conditioner.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s magical, but it&#x27;s good.  I particularly like the smell.</li>
            <li> Smells like lemon and also makes your hair very soft!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Caucasian with very coarse, bleached hair. I shampoo infrequently because my hair is so dry. Most of the time I co-wash, but when I do need to shampoo my hair (mostly for toning) I always use this after. I don&#x27;t sit under a dryer, I just use it like a normal conditioner. My hair always feels very soft after I use this, and I don&#x27;t have to blow-dry it to keep it from looking frizzy like I normally do. I also love the scent; it smells exactly like orange zest.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair easier to comb out after washing and especially after a perm.  I order by half dozen and cheaper on line than in stores. Although it may turn out to be the same price after s&amp;h.</li>
            <li> Disappointed, because I expected an organic product. The brand name is misleading, and product is overpriced. It contains parabens and silicones, along other chemical ingredients. Hoping the product works well on my hair for the price I paid. Do not buy if searching for an actual organic product!</li>
