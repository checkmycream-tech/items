    <ol>
            <li>This product works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s perfect for me.</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome!  </li>
            <li>The clumping was awesome!  </li>
            <li>the price is great.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and does a great job aside from the flaking; the flaking was the deal breaker for me.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t experienced that.</li>
            <li>It felt amazing going on and smells wonderful (some people think smell is overpowering).  </li>
            <li>It smells really nice too!</li>
            <li>But is good ingredients/natural.</li>
            <li>I have Scottish curly hair and have found this product superior to any gel or mousse I have used.</li>
            <li>I did a wash-n-go and this product did a good job.</li>
            <li>The definition was good</li>
            <li>product works fairly well along with liquid hair/body oil and polishing/shine serum.  </li>
            <li>It sure is good ingredients</li>
            <li>I now co-wash, oil my hair rinse in warm water co-</li>
            <li>Very easy to use as well.</li>
            <li>I am really happy with it &amp; for the price, it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>Its reasonable priced, it&#x27;s on the ground, it gave my hair a nice shine and great curl definition.  </li>
            <li>but I make sure it don&#x27;t have mineral oil or anything.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>But let you know I use water in spirtz most time, and drink a lot water.</li>
            <li>that way it is more like Jelly gel</li>
            <li>BIG JAR AND GREAT PRICE!</li>
            <li>This is more of a gel than a cream.</li>
            <li>I have tried a variety of gels for wash-n-go&#x27;s and this one is about to become my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>May work better on longer hair, but not 4a/b TWA.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s more of a gel verses a cream/creme and may be suited for softer, finer textured hair.</li>
            <li>and sometimes I use Eco styler gel and love the results.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve tried Kinky Curly Curling Custard, then this a comparable product at a way more affordable price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it works best for me as a final styler.</li>
            <li>When I used it alone I also found that the more I touched it</li>
            <li>the more flakes</li>
            <li>there were and touching</li>
            <li>but it give me some the best hair days I&#x27;ve had in a long time.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this product at the Whole Foods Market but was happy to be able to order it from Amazon while working in Aghanistan.  </li>
            <li>, I make sure I light</li>
            <li>For someone with all curls, even wild curly or wirey hair this is great.  </li>
            <li>It can leak easily.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;3c\\&quot; curls and prefer styling products that moisturize and define my curls and give a strong hold.</li>
            <li>pretty sure I used more than a dime size.</li>
            <li>I am glad I got it quickly because I need something cheap and creme-based</li>
            <li>Well the next day came and my hair looked great and the curls held.  </li>
            <li>I only experienced frizz on day 4</li>
            <li>When my hair dries it has a light crunch to it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it to have a defined curl!  </li>
            <li>Stay Clean Shampoo and Queen Helene Royal Curl Moisture Rich Conditioner as well.</li>
            <li>Whole Foods has testers and I was able to touch both products in the store.  </li>
            <li>It is close natural better than Giovanni products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is more moisture than Cantu Natural twisting gel .</li>
            <li>found out right away why a lot ppl get crunchy feeling hair from that.</li>
            <li>I rinse my hair daily with warm to hot water and reapply the creme every morning.  </li>
            <li>I just rub it all together in my hands and then rub it in my hair, trying to make sure I get it down to the roots and not just on top.  </li>
            <li>It actually made the silky fine hairs that frame my face kind of wild.  </li>
            <li>But if I use a cream styler &amp; water on 2nd or 3rd day hair, it refreshes this product &amp; looks great.</li>
            <li>I read Queen Helene ingredients again, it sounds like it has more moisture than regular gel.</li>
            <li>Most likely won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li>I did have flakes the first time I used it (alone)</li>
            <li>so sectioned first</li>
            <li>Based on what i read on the jar, I thought this would be a good everyday use product for my TWA.</li>
            <li>for $8, it is worth the try and it truly is my new HEAVEN in HAIR product.  </li>
            <li>but I was super busy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best applied on soaking wet hair in small sections at a time.</li>
            <li>I too compared it too the KC Curling Custard in consistency and for $7.99 opted to take it home instead of a $29.99 large jar of KCCC.  </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, at night I pineapple my hair (loosely pull hair on top of the head,</li>
            <li>If you apply or hand-heavy too much.</li>
            <li>Both in mixture it is like intense</li>
            <li>So I was browsing in Whole Foods ($7.99), saw this and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>This product really works.  </li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>and I really wanted it to work.</li>
            <li>I was in Whole Foods looking to buy/try the Kinky Curly Curling Custard</li>
            <li>but that doesn&#x27;t bother me and my very TWA of 4 b/c hair.  </li>
            <li>I made sure to apply to my hair while it was still wet.  </li>
            <li>If I couldn&#x27;t find anything good I usually go Shea moisture line because it is the only cheap natural cream based that</li>
            <li>Like many who have previously commented, I too found this while shopping in Whole Foods.  </li>
            <li>When it comes to fine curly, dry hair; Queen Helene does the job.</li>
            <li>It gives my hair a full, moist and actually nourishes the health of my hair in the sense that</li>
            <li>I live in an extremely humid, rainy climate &amp; this held up better than Kinky Curly Custard.</li>
            <li>It helps retain moisture along with them because it is high in glyernic and agrave.</li>
            <li>hand it while using my old Shea Moisture line on other hand, for more moisture.</li>
            <li>While the product does a great job in defining and holding natural curls, it does not dry well (at least not for me) and leaves flake.  </li>
            <li>I thought maybe I used too much and tried two more times using very little and the results were the same...white flakes.  </li>
            <li>Then I apply this by scrunching a generous amount into my hair, about 2 Whoppers worth for each of 4 sections (front, sides, back).</li>
            <li>I think the key to combating that is making sure the hair remains wet while you apply it.</li>
            <li>This is a well formulated modern product that worked very well on my long, porous, 3b hair.</li>
            <li>so it was hard for me to determine what&#x27;s appropriate in terms of hair crunch.  </li>
            <li>Finally I started using either a pomade or light moisturizer after drying my hair and it helped somewhat but not a whole lot.</li>
            <li>it came, I was kinda disappionted that gel based because I already have Cantu natural that is gel.</li>
            <li>I used a modified curly girl method on my natural 4a/b hair.  </li>
            <li>The wash-n-go style lasted a total of 4 days (in very humid climate) before I had to touch my hair again.</li>
            <li>It adds shine to my hair and enhances my natural curl pattern.  </li>
            <li>A natural way to keep curls bouncy and not frizzy.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair and it kept my curls soft, shiny, and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I would recommend me this to anyone with curly hair and need a product that is all natural.</li>
            <li>I was spending nearly $30 per jar for Kinky Kurly jar</li>
            <li>I have been natural for over 2 years</li>
            <li>My hair does have a natural curl to it</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I used applied too much or the right amount of QH Royal Cream in my hair because when my hair dried it had a crunch</li>
            <li>Butlike with every other product you&#x27;ll have to figure out the right application amount.    </li>
            <li>That being said it was hard to get just the right amount and if there is high humdity</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it is not damaged but only glorified in the natural state that its in.</li>
            <li>I have been trying to find products that work for my African American natural hair for over a year.  </li>
            <li>This does not work as well as a cream-styler under gel for me, or on 2nd day hair, when it causes major crunch.</li>
            <li>Sadly, I have a multitude of textures on my head ranging from fine and straight in the front to curly Q and wirey kinks in the back.  </li>
            <li>After its totally dry, my curls are ver defined, soft &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li>I selected Desert Essence Coconut Conditioner as my leave-in and used a small amount of Qhemet Biologics Alma and Olive Heavy Cream on top of the leave-in.</li>

            <li> For a little extra body, I may blow dry or gently rub my hands in one direction over the length of the hair.</li>
            <li> In the past, whenever I use too much product my hair always dries with a white film.  </li>
            <li> It is super tacky and leaves behind white flakes.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure if I used too much</li>
            <li> I think this is why the name of the product is reflects royalty and glorifies the beauty of black hair in its natural essence.</li>
            <li> I tried different amounts on 2 other days and got the same results.</li>
            <li> This product did moisturize my hair and provide great hold at the same time, BUT the amount of white flakes produced was very annoying.</li>
            <li> I have long, frizz prone</li>
            <li> When I first tried the product, I sectioned my hair into very small partitions and applied it liberally to wet hair.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I used the wrong leave-in conditioner or applied too much product but the white residue was a major turn-off for me.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> I let my hair air dry.    </li>
            <li> It went on well, but by the end of the day, my hair was dry and had flakes.</li>
            <li> Then I let it air dry.  </li>

            <li> while in the shower i remove my scrunchy and the steam/mist from the shower causes my hair to fall back down to my shoulders.</li>

            <li> the Queen Helen&#x27;s Royal Curl Cream into soaking wet hair.  </li>
            <li> but surprisingly it dried without the white film.</li>
            <li> And lasts longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> I condition-wash, apply styling cream &amp; gel in wet hair, &amp; put it up in a towel for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> but I need someting to tame it and keep the frizz down daily.  </li>
            <li> It kept my frizzes down as well.</li>
            <li> Although does smoothe the hair down.  </li>
            <li> It did weigh my hair down so my curls to hang a bit longer with it on.  </li>
            <li> I had less frizz, &amp; no crunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I also saw this product for less than half the price of the KCCC.  </li>
            <li> I divide my soaking wet hair in four, apply product to small sections while smoothing down each curl.</li>
            <li> This worked extremely well to tame the wires and curls without leaving an oily or waxy residue</li>
            <li> It will define your curls but feel like a gooey mess on your head because of this I will never use again</li>
            <li> but it was a little crunchy.</li>
            <li> It is a little crunchy</li>
            <li> I let the curls dry in place (no touching!)</li>
            <li> that is heavy because I have a lot hair.</li>
            <li> So I always go with heavy creme</li>
            <li> The rim appears to have crusted dried up product around it, as if its been opened and used.  </li>
            <li> It is somewhat heavy, so i think curls in a 2-3a range might not benefit from this product.</li>
            <li> It also dried her hair out.</li>
            <li> I use a dime/nickel sized amount of the curl shaping cream with a few drops of oil and a few drops of serum.  </li>
            <li> Folks have complained about the product leaving flakes and to that I&#x27;d say...ensure you apply to WET hair...</li>
            <li> I co-washed and conditioned my hair as usual and then put in my go to Kinky Curly Knot</li>
            <li> However, after drying, the product caked/flaked up right at the base of my hair.  </li>
            <li> It will get really hard</li>
            <li> Aside from this product being much less expensive, it is also much less fragrant, which I prefer!  </li>
            <li> Some people have also complained of flakes</li>
            <li> This product may be too heavy for wavy or thin hair (like 2a, 2b, 3a) and too jelly like for some curl types (some 4a, 4b) that prefer creme stylers.</li>
            <li> Not happy about this.  </li>
            <li> Note: it does look quite disgusting, but that slimy, opaque texture makes it easier to work into the hair than a thick cream.</li>
            <li> Horrible.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> It was cheaper on Vicatost , it was on sale (I think) I am glad I got it quickly because I need something cheap and creme-based that is heavy because I have a lot hair. So I always go with heavy creme but I make sure it don&#x27;t have mineral oil or anything. But is good ingredients/natural. If I couldn&#x27;t find anything good I usually go Shea moisture line because it is the only cheap natural cream based that heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it came, I was kinda disappionted that gel based because I already have Cantu natural that is gel. I read Queen Helene ingredients again, it sounds like it has more moisture than regular gel. It sure is good ingredients but I wouldn&#x27;t say it is 100% natural/organic. It is close natural better than Giovanni products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found out right away why a lot ppl get crunchy feeling hair from that. If you apply or hand-heavy too much. It will get really hard , I make sure I light hand it while using my old Shea Moisture line on other hand, for more moisture. It goes really long , you only need a little. It lasts moisturized for two days then I re apply it! I will repurchase. I love it. But let you know I use water in spirtz most time, and drink a lot water. It helps retain moisture along with them because it is high in glyernic and agrave. Both in mixture it is like intense moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put that way it is more like Jelly gel creamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is more moisture than Cantu Natural twisting gel . BIG JAR AND GREAT PRICE! I dunno abt amazon shipping but I rather vicatost because it is carefully and will not let it leak. It can leak easily.</li>
            <li> This is more of a gel than a cream. That being said it was hard to get just the right amount and if there is high humdity this gel has a lot of glycerin in it so you get frizz. I&#x27;ve working out the kinks in using it but it give me some the best hair days I&#x27;ve had in a long time.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even used it because upon twisting off the cap, there&#x27;s no protective seal between the lid and the product.  The rim appears to have crusted dried up product around it, as if its been opened and used.  Not happy about this.  Going to return!</li>
            <li> Ok.  So I was browsing in Whole Foods ($7.99), saw this and decided to give it a try.  I used a modified curly girl method on my natural 4a/b hair.  I selected Desert Essence Coconut Conditioner as my leave-in and used a small amount of Qhemet Biologics Alma and Olive Heavy Cream on top of the leave-in. I styled my hair in a wash-n-go.  I sectioned my hair in about 6-8 sections and applied (sort of shingled) the Queen Helen&#x27;s Royal Curl Cream into soaking wet hair.  I let my hair air dry.    My hair dried in a reasonable amount of time.     I don&#x27;t know if I used applied too much or the right amount of QH Royal Cream in my hair because when my hair dried it had a crunch but surprisingly it dried without the white film. In the past, whenever I use too much product my hair always dries with a white film.  The back of the jar suggest using a dime size when applying to sections-I&#x27;m pretty sure I used more than a dime size. So I&#x27;m not sure if I used too much but I&#x27;ll continue to tweak application amount. I suggest for initial applications follow the instructions closely.      Initally i wanted to wash the QH out of my hair but I was super busy so I let the QH stay in my hair until I found time to redo.  Meanwhile, at night I pineapple my hair (loosely pull hair on top of the head, held together with a scrunchy).   Well the next day came and my hair looked great and the curls held.  The wash-n-go style lasted a total of 4 days (in very humid climate) before I had to touch my hair again. I didn&#x27;t even spritz my hair with water to reactivate the curls.  Typically my wash-n-goes do not last this long.     I have tried a variety of gels for wash-n-go&#x27;s and this one is about to become my favorite.  Its reasonable priced, it&#x27;s on the ground, it gave my hair a nice shine and great curl definition.  I only experienced frizz on day 4 and I rinsed out the following day. I got a lot of complements on my hair when using QH.         So would I recommend this to a curly girl? Yes! Butlike with every other product you&#x27;ll have to figure out the right application amount.    _____________________________  Update 7/14/11    I&#x27;ve used this product for over a month and still like it.  I&#x27;ve never been a gel person so it was hard for me to determine what&#x27;s appropriate in terms of hair crunch.  I&#x27;ve decrease the amount of QH i apply to my hair. When my hair dries it has a light crunch to it. My wash-n-goes still last for 4 days without spritzing.  while in the shower i remove my scrunchy and the steam/mist from the shower causes my hair to fall back down to my shoulders. After i get out of the shower, i shake my head side to side to help the remaining strands fall and i&#x27;m done styling.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find products that work for my African American natural hair for over a year.  This product really works.  It adds shine to my hair and enhances my natural curl pattern.  I originally purchased this product at the Whole Foods Market but was happy to be able to order it from Amazon while working in Aghanistan.  I recommend using the Queen Helene Royal Curl Stay Clean Shampoo and Queen Helene Royal Curl Moisture Rich Conditioner as well.</li>
            <li> When it comes to fine curly, dry hair; Queen Helene does the job. After washing it, I apply this product to my hair, it defines my curls and  quenches the dryness throughout my hair. It gives my hair a full, moist and actually nourishes the health of my hair in the sense that&lt;br /&gt;it is not damaged but only glorified in the natural state that its in. It does not damage your hair like perms or weaves can, it is simply an organic product that is made to enhance the state of black hair. I think this is why the name of the product is reflects royalty and glorifies the beauty of black hair in its natural essence.</li>
            <li> This product really works. And lasts longer than I expected. Very easy to use as well. Smells wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is a holding product for curly hair. It is somewhat heavy, so i think curls in a 2-3a range might not benefit from this product. I am African American with 3c-4a hair. This product did moisturize my hair and provide great hold at the same time, BUT the amount of white flakes produced was very annoying. As soon as I was done diffusing my hair, I would rub my hands through and it would just start snowing. White residue flakes were everywhere. I tried different leave-in conditioners with this product and always had the same result. Finally I started using either a pomade or light moisturizer after drying my hair and it helped somewhat but not a whole lot. I have used two of these containers and after the second jar, I called it quits. Maybe I used the wrong leave-in conditioner or applied too much product but the white residue was a major turn-off for me.</li>
            <li> A natural way to keep curls bouncy and not frizzy. I have Scottish curly hair and have found this product superior to any gel or mousse I have used.</li>
            <li> This product works wonderfully. I have curly hair and it kept my curls soft, shiny, and moisturized. It kept my frizzes down as well. I would recommend me this to anyone with curly hair and need a product that is all natural.</li>
            <li> I did a wash-n-go and this product did a good job. The definition was good but it was a little crunchy. I had to scrunch my hair to get rid of the crunch.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I was spending nearly $30 per jar for Kinky Kurly jar but this works just as well on my hair and the price is great.  I have been natural for over 2 years and I&#x27;ve used this product daily since January.  My hair does have a natural curl to it but I need someting to tame it and keep the frizz down daily.  I rinse my hair daily with warm to hot water and reapply the creme every morning.  I only use the shampoo and conditioner about every 7-10 days.</li>
            <li> When I first tried the product, I sectioned my hair into very small partitions and applied it liberally to wet hair.  After the product dried, my curls were nice and defined and there wasn&#x27;t any sticky residue left behind.  However, after drying, the product caked/flaked up right at the base of my hair.  Horrible.  I thought maybe I used too much and tried two more times using very little and the results were the same...white flakes.  While the product does a great job in defining and holding natural curls, it does not dry well (at least not for me) and leaves flake.  I&#x27;m going to use the rest as a conditioner that I&#x27;ll definitely rinse out and after that I will not purchase the product again.  It smells great and does a great job aside from the flaking; the flaking was the deal breaker for me.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I have a multitude of textures on my head ranging from fine and straight in the front to curly Q and wirey kinks in the back.  This worked extremely well to tame the wires and curls without leaving an oily or waxy residue but my problem was the front.  It actually made the silky fine hairs that frame my face kind of wild.  For someone with all curls, even wild curly or wirey hair this is great.  It smells really nice too!</li>
            <li> Based on what i read on the jar, I thought this would be a good everyday use product for my TWA. It went on well, but by the end of the day, my hair was dry and had flakes. I tried different amounts on 2 other days and got the same results. May work better on longer hair, but not 4a/b TWA.</li>
            <li> My daughter has 4a hair and I really wanted it to work. It is super tacky and leaves behind white flakes. It also dried her hair out. It does not compare to kinky curly in from my experience.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this curl creme would shape texture, by giving it a wetter and moisturizing looks, but instead it flaked.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s more of a gel verses a cream/creme and may be suited for softer, finer textured hair.</li>
            <li> It will define your curls but feel like a gooey mess on your head because of this I will never use again I now co-wash, oil my hair rinse in warm water co- wash again to take off excess oil apply a leave in conditioner and gel I like flax seed gel and sometimes I use Eco styler gel and love the results.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve tried Kinky Curly Curling Custard, then this a comparable product at a way more affordable price. I have long, frizz prone \\&quot;3c\\&quot; curls and prefer styling products that moisturize and define my curls and give a strong hold. This product does just that and helps me maintain my curls for 3-4 days with minimum re-styling. It&#x27;s best applied on soaking wet hair in small sections at a time. I divide my soaking wet hair in four, apply product to small sections while smoothing down each curl. I let the curls dry in place (no touching!) and voila. For a little extra body, I may blow dry or gently rub my hands in one direction over the length of the hair. This also removes some of the crunch that some complain about. Some people have also complained of flakes but I haven&#x27;t experienced that. I think the key to combating that is making sure the hair remains wet while you apply it. This product may be too heavy for wavy or thin hair (like 2a, 2b, 3a) and too jelly like for some curl types (some 4a, 4b) that prefer creme stylers. But it&#x27;s perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much because, well, if you remember that &#x27;80s staple QH Conditioning Cream (heavy on the mineral oil &amp; a scent I can only describe as like Band-Aids). But, surprise! This is a well formulated modern product that worked very well on my long, porous, 3b hair. I live in an extremely humid, rainy climate &amp; this held up better than Kinky Curly Custard. I had less frizz, &amp; no crunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a cream, but a pudding. Note: it does look quite disgusting, but that slimy, opaque texture makes it easier to work into the hair than a thick cream. I&#x27;ve found it works best for me as a final styler. I condition-wash, apply styling cream &amp; gel in wet hair, &amp; put it up in a towel for 10 minutes. Then I apply this by scrunching a generous amount into my hair, about 2 Whoppers worth for each of 4 sections (front, sides, back). After its totally dry, my curls are ver defined, soft &amp; shiny. This does not work as well as a cream-styler under gel for me, or on 2nd day hair, when it causes major crunch. It&#x27;s not a versatile product for me, hence the 4 stars. But if I use a cream styler &amp; water on 2nd or 3rd day hair, it refreshes this product &amp; looks great. I am really happy with it &amp; for the price, it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  Glue like flaking after a couple days.  Although does smoothe the hair down.  Most likely won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> I was in Whole Foods looking to buy/try the Kinky Curly Curling Custard and I also saw this product for less than half the price of the KCCC.  Whole Foods has testers and I was able to touch both products in the store.  It seems the two products have a very similar consistency.  Aside from this product being much less expensive, it is also much less fragrant, which I prefer!  I personally don&#x27;t like walking around having to smell fruity smells from my hair all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works fairly well along with liquid hair/body oil and polishing/shine serum.  That combats the dryness and dullness that I found when I used the Queen Helene Curl Shaping Creme alone.  It is a little crunchy but that doesn&#x27;t bother me and my very TWA of 4 b/c hair.  It&#x27;s worth it to have a defined curl!  I use a dime/nickel sized amount of the curl shaping cream with a few drops of oil and a few drops of serum.  I just rub it all together in my hands and then rub it in my hair, trying to make sure I get it down to the roots and not just on top.  Then I let it air dry.  I did have flakes the first time I used it (alone) but when I used it again with the oil and the serum I didn&#x27;t have the flakes.  When I used it alone I also found that the more I touched it the more flakes there were and touching it caused the curls to change to puff!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!  Like many who have previously commented, I too found this while shopping in Whole Foods.  I too compared it too the KC Curling Custard in consistency and for $7.99 opted to take it home instead of a $29.99 large jar of KCCC.  I co-washed and conditioned my hair as usual and then put in my go to Kinky Curly Knot Today and then I started to apply the Queen Helene.  I made sure to apply to my hair while it was still wet.  I have very long hair so sectioned first and then I apply generously and then used a Denman brush to ensure it was evenly applied.  It felt amazing going on and smells wonderful (some people think smell is overpowering).  The clumping was awesome!  It did weigh my hair down so my curls to hang a bit longer with it on.  Folks have complained about the product leaving flakes and to that I&#x27;d say...ensure you apply to WET hair...even so, this product will need to be washed out after 3 or 4 days.  Bottomline...for $8, it is worth the try and it truly is my new HEAVEN in HAIR product.  I have 3c hair that spirals at the ends...I have very limited to ZERO frizz after using it.  I think I will get around to trying the rest of the line!</li>
