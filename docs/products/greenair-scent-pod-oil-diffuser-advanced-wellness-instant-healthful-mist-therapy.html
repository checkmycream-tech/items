            <li>Great for work or on the go</li>

            <li>What a great product.  </li>
            <li>No water needed so great for car, office, travel.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t use an oil diffuser in my cubicle, so when I found this, I thought I would be a great alternative.  </li>
            <li>Lol.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li>Very effective.</li>
            <li>I used Bergamot oil (just 5 drops), and within minutes my living area smelled amazing!</li>
            <li>Have one in each of my kids room that I diffuse a good night oil in which helps them sleep great.</li>
            <li>I am very happy!  :))</li>
            <li>Okay, it would get 5 stars, but I just got this an hour ago, and although it&#x27;s working wonderfully</li>
            <li>But bright.</li>
            <li>I bought this to put in the bathroom and diffuse in the mornings for a good wake up...</li>
            <li>and it does a good job.</li>
            <li>THE DIFFUSER WAS PACKAGED WELL AND ARRIVED IN GOOD CONDITION,  </li>
            <li>Works good for now with batteries.</li>
            <li>the light is very bright on off button.</li>
            <li>They make wonderful gifts as well as so useful  around the house.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with my Greenair Scent Pod Oil Diffuser.  </li>
            <li>By far the best travel diffuser I have and great for the price.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love the portability factor!  </li>
            <li>love that!</li>
            <li>Love it and would suggest it to anyone!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Product works great and it got to me quickly!</li>
            <li>Our car smells amazing</li>
            <li>I diffused my peppermint oil, and my car smelled amazing.  </li>
            <li>The whole room smells wonderful now!&lt;br /&gt;Put</li>
            <li>Liked the scent pod, wish it were a mist humidifier with portability</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s my own fault for not reading the product description.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s working nicely.</li>
            <li>So handy.</li>
            <li>get one that diffuses with water, nice travel piece though.</li>
            <li>Nice compact unit.  </li>
            <li>It would make a nice gift for a colleague.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving this diffuser.  </li>
            <li>My room smell so good love</li>
            <li>It spreads the fragrance nicely.</li>
            <li>Very good buy, powers right by my laptop/computer.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very easy to use.</li>
            <li>everyone really liked them very cute and very user-friendly would be a great Christmas gift stocking stuffer</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to have one for my bathroom and for my own bedroom.</li>
            <li>But I wanted to use it at night while I sleep and the light is way to bright.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t have champagne expectations on a beer budget,  but for $11, I&#x27;m very happy so far.</li>
            <li>This company is by far 1 of the BEST I&#x27;ve ever ordered from.</li>
            <li>It would be great for a car, bathroom, nightstand right beside your bed, or on your end table like I&#x27;m doing.</li>
            <li>Easy!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a great whole room defuser!</li>
            <li>Very cheaply put together.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad this was my first purchase of a diffuser, it has been a great experience.</li>
            <li>And I love that you can either run it via usb cord (need adapter which is not included) or by batteries.</li>
            <li>I Love how portable this scent pod is.  </li>
            <li>also love that you have 2 options, a usb cord and batteries to use it.  </li>
            <li>Arrived on time, packaged well works &amp; looks as described, have purchased 2 more for additional gifts</li>
            <li>I purchased another brand and like it much better.</li>
            <li>This is the third one I have ordered, and they are great!  </li>
            <li>I use mine with batteries most of the time but can be plugged in when needed.  </li>
            <li>love the scent pod - but it says: can use with an ac adapter</li>
            <li>It definitely works great in his room!</li>
            <li>I plan to get more...</li>
            <li>I love the convenience of having the option to plug them in or use batteries.</li>
            <li>so well I can&#x27;t wait to purchase more.</li>
            <li>and I love that I can choose the oils I want to use.</li>
            <li>I have 2 planning on ordering much more for friends</li>
            <li>I love it, have it in my office at work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>This works ok.</li>
            <li>Love this pod.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>Love it, bought two one for my room one for my car...</li>
            <li>Will buy more for gifts..</li>
            <li>Love that it works off my pc because when I turn that off the fan goes off too.</li>
            <li>( I may have to buy a couple more)  </li>
            <li>just okay.</li>
            <li>For an inexpensive diffuser, this is okay</li>
            <li>I think the best use is sitting next to you on a desk.</li>
            <li>I love how you can plug it in with the USB cord or, use the battery.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this diffuser.</li>
            <li>I use it in my office and love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I gave this a try.</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>They are okay</li>
            <li>I like about this too, you can plug in any room at the most decrete place.</li>
            <li>Like most candle burning aromatherapy, you worry about refilling the water or replacing the tea candle before it dries out or burns out.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li>Also, if you need a stronger smell, put more drops of your EOs on the scent pad.</li>
            <li>However, for the price, I am pleased.</li>
            <li>I ordered a variety of oils to use in it, and have been pleased with them all.  </li>
            <li>love turning it on at my desk while working...</li>
            <li>I love that you can use batteries if you want to move it around or take it in your car even.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend the InstaNatural Cool Mist Diffuser, I own it</li>
            <li>Since so many of these are $30, $40 and so much more, I didn&#x27;t hold out much hope for a good quality product.</li>
            <li>It is pretty bright at night, use it as a night light in my kids rooms but I don&#x27;t like it in my room as any kind of light bothers me when I am trying to sleep.</li>
            <li>So it is a very clean and easy diffuser to use.</li>
            <li>Very cool item,  </li>
            <li>My kids love it because it&#x27;s like a night light, but I prefer darkness when I sleep.  </li>
            <li>Everyone who comes into the office thinks it smells fantastic :)  </li>
            <li>They replaced the part and is working fantastic, I really Love this device.</li>
            <li>Great product arrived a day early</li>
            <li>I just plug it into my computer and have a beautiful essential oil scent to enjoy!  </li>
            <li>Cute but cheap.  </li>
            <li>SO FAR IT HAS WORKED GREAT</li>
            <li>I wish it had some kind of heating element, instead of just a fan to blow the fragrance around, but at this price point, I feel it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>I ordered these thinking they would be a good addition to the scentbug that I already had as they run on usb power, but they really dont seem to have the power that the scentbug has.</li>
            <li>I used one of the original pads to draw an outline and cut out for more pads from a sheet of felt I purchased at a craft store.  </li>
            <li>This feature makes them easily portable.</li>
            <li>this gadget easy to use cheap to opperate</li>
            <li>It is a perfect little addition to my offices.</li>
            <li>This little pod works great!</li>
            <li>Great little product to keep a room smelling good and fresh.  </li>
            <li>These are loud (the fan) and the light is way too bright for night time.</li>
            <li>A GREAT alternative way to enjoy my essential oils.</li>
            <li>but if keep next to your bed at night, it works great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks now and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>The Aromafier refill pads fit this</li>
            <li>It runs very quite and diffuses the oil nicely.</li>
            <li>a fart is more powerful than this s</li>
            <li>Very happy with my Green Air Scent POD oil diffuser</li>
            <li>and I liked it so much I bought three for gifts and</li>
            <li>the fan and sound machine help drown it out some.</li>
            <li>Great gift idea for essential oil lovers.</li>
            <li>I enjoy them both.</li>
            <li>Not what I excepted its can of cheap and will not buy again.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my toddlers bedroom (13 x 9) and it does a fantastic job of diffusing the scent throughout his room.</li>
            <li>After I let them know the product was defective, they immediately sent me out a replacement free of charge.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>It runs quietly and is perfect for setting on my night table to diffuse my oils without inundating the whole house.</li>
            <li>They diffuse my peppermint oil which is not too potent but just right.</li>
            <li>It scents up my space pretty good with out much noise.  </li>
            <li>Excellent small diffuser.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for a small room, a bathroom, or the car.</li>
            <li>But for a small space, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>If it does I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li>This is perfect for smaller desk areas, and plugs up easily to your USB port (and I&#x27;m a total techno-phobe).  </li>
            <li>HOWEVER you do most certainly get what you paid for (I paid $10).</li>
            <li>Just the right size!</li>
            <li>This diffuser is great at providing a nice subtle stream of scent.  </li>
            <li>I use only my Youngevity Essential Oils in it and specifically enjoy our Peppermint and change off to our Spearmint for a clean wonderful aroma.</li>
            <li>Works great, just wish the fan was a little more powerful</li>
            <li>smell is strong right away, and fades quickly.</li>
            <li>If an oil is particularly sweet</li>
            <li>Love this it works really well in my car.  </li>
            <li>This is OK, it does not give out any mist, so the aroma was much stronger.</li>
            <li>It sounds like the fan is hitting something, and based on many reviews, I think this is unusual.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>What I love is the smells are all natural and not  flowery and chemical ridden!!!</li>
            <li>However, I have it right on my desk at work and enjoy the fact that I don&#x27;t have to use water with it.</li>
            <li>My whole office smells great and it is quiet as can be.</li>
            <li>This is really neat- good air diffusion with the fan, quiet, bright blue light helps you see it and remember if you need to turn it off.  </li>
            <li>Works great, love how small it is!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more for all cars and the bedrooms!</li>
            <li>There are diffusers that blow more air but that causes the oil to dry up faster and uses more battery power.</li>
            <li>but this is a great little diffuser.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little scent pod.  </li>
            <li>GREAT LITTLE DIFFUSER.</li>
            <li>Great little diffuser, until it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>The power light is a little bright, but doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>Cheap doesn&#x27;t really work</li>
            <li>But, it filled the whole room.</li>
            <li>Wish I spent more and got something better</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice diffuser and works quietly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and super quiet!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just right.</li>
            <li>I have the pod right on my desk.  </li>
            <li>Right now mine is running on batteries.</li>
            <li>This is a great little diffuser!</li>
            <li>Great little gizmo for $10!</li>
            <li>Works fine but not as good as a more expensive diffuser mist.</li>
            <li>The new 1 seems to be working just fine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for small spaces and needs no water.</li>
            <li>If you want a little aromatherapy right beside you, or in a smaller rooms, it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li>It is not one to diffuse for an entire room but bathrooms (or super small areas) are great!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but wished it had a little more power.</li>
            <li>Spend a little more for better quality.</li>
            <li>The water diffusers are wonderful, but expensive and mine seem to burn out pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Its ok for a kids small room or to take in the car I assumed it would be bigger, but works great in my daughters room</li>
            <li>Works great and small enough to be out of my way I love it</li>
            <li>I love plugging it into my computer and having a waft of scent right next to me at my desk.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting very much</li>
            <li>Super easy to use, discreet design and quiet.  </li>
            <li>I have it at work and for the most part it&#x27;s very quiet.  </li>
            <li>so I moved it to the mantle which is much higher to keep it out of reach.</li>
            <li>I have it in my living room with four or five drops of lavender and it fills the room pretty well.</li>
            <li>I have 3 and set the first one up in my living room.</li>
            <li>They were fantastic when I went directly to the company about my unit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Mine have been running consistently for about a week without being shut off</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be getting more of these in the future!</li>
            <li>My first one made some noise after about 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT as it sites quietly on my desk at work!  </li>
            <li>but I am hoping it might be better in a smaller area ?</li>
            <li>I only use it for 15 mins at the most to help the ordor and turn it off when I leave for work.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>Not expensive too.</li>
            <li>The first one did not work at all.  </li>
            <li>So I made sure it was actually working.</li>
            <li>Pretty.</li>
            <li>A colleague of mine had bought something similar, and I enjoyed the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I used batteries my first day &amp; they died within a couple hours.</li>
            <li>The on /off button stopped working the first week</li>
            <li>If it lasts a while I&#x27;ll buy more for other rooms, the price is right!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t add humidity like other diffusers but it&#x27;s nice for my office.</li>
            <li>It really takes care of a large room!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s great because I can have a different pad for energizing blends and mental clarity too.  </li>
            <li>but you really need to keep them very close to you to be able to smell your essential oils.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very compact &amp; works well after first adding drops.</li>
            <li>It emits scent for a small space which is good for me.</li>
            <li>The included USB cable has a good amount of length to it, freeing you up to move the diffuser further away, if you prefer a more subtle scent.  </li>
            <li>It comes with pads easy to put essential on, and lasts for hours!</li>
            <li>Well, Comes with USB cord, Easy to Set Up, Very Quiet</li>
            <li>Well made, compact, easy to change pads for different oils.  </li>
            <li>This is easy to travel with and quiet.</li>
            <li>It fits well on the console and the fan is strong enough to fill my midsize car.</li>
            <li>- doesn&#x27;t fill a large space with scent, doesn&#x27;t fully diffuse all scents in a blend, need to replace the diffuser pads to change the scent (it comes with 3)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;CONS: Smell won&#x27;t fill a large room, Will run through batteries if not using USB cord&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;-This is not intended to fill a large room.</li>
            <li>Again, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for a large space.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t diffuse a large area.</li>
            <li>I contacted the company and they sent out a new one right away.  </li>
            <li>I put it next to the bed with 2 drops of lavender on the pad and it worked jut fine.</li>
            <li>and I use lemongrass and rosemary essential oils as a quick pick-me-up!</li>
            <li>Nice little scent maker.  </li>
            <li>This item uses large scent pads (comes with several) that you drop your oil on and enjoy.</li>
            <li>Great little diffuser, exceptionally quiet.  </li>
            <li>It has started making such a huge rattling noise that I can&#x27;t use it at my desk anymore because it disturbs me and everyone around me.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is how bright the light is on the on/off button.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t take up much space, but work</li>
            <li>it work&#x27;s very well.</li>
            <li>suggest looking at the more expensive alternatives from the same company and spend more on a better product.</li>
            <li>Mine is in a bathroom and it fills the room very well.</li>
            <li>I took it to work and it made to much noise to use it.</li>
            <li>I really like how this works</li>
            <li>But what I can&#x27;t stand is the brightness of the light and the noise the inner fan makes.</li>
            <li>Very flimsy and unreliable device.</li>
            <li>I soaked the pad when I was not getting much of a scent</li>
            <li>but that really didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot on a diffuser.</li>
            <li>But I really wanted to give diffusing incense oils a try.</li>
            <li>But, it does put the smell out in the room very well</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>So, I am not using it quite as much anymore.</li>
            <li>Works ok but no real instructions</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like it really gets the scent out into the air</li>
            <li>I got this for diffusing in the car and it works very well.</li>
            <li>so I really didnt know what to expect.</li>
            <li>The following day it came on right away, but when I unplugged it to add some more oil to the pad, I never got it to come back on again.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Wow, these rock!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little smaller than I had expected it to be but that just makes it more convenient Loving it!</li>
            <li>Not loud at all - I could easily fall asleep to it -</li>
            <li>I have ordered two more to use in other rooms.</li>
            <li>More than worth the small price.</li>
            <li>Great little dry diffuser.</li>
            <li>Even so, it&#x27;s a great little diffuser for single oils</li>
            <li>Have to have it right next to your face to be aware of the scent</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been reading up on different single oils and each have their own note-</li>
            <li>Nice and small.</li>
            <li>I use more essential oil on this than the regular oil diffuser.  </li>
            <li>Super simple setup &amp; replacements.</li>
            <li>it puts out a decent stream.</li>
            <li>I have a decent sized office and I can hear the fan in the hallway.</li>
            <li>Aroma filled our large living room, so now I know only one or two drops of essential oil will certainly do the trick in the truck.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a strong scent but good enough to turn the basement into a spa.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>it up high</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these, as well as the brand.</li>
            <li>I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT HIGHLY.</li>
            <li>I love these little things.</li>
            <li>absolutely love this little guy.</li>
            <li>Cute little item, does the trick.  </li>
            <li>We absolutely love these little diffusers.  </li>
            <li>This cute little oil diffuser has a convenient USB plug-in option, which is why I bought it for my office, but it rattles.</li>
            <li>May be good for a larger area but for my office, the scent is a little over bearing to handle, for me!</li>
            <li>The batteries last a long time and this little gem diffuses the essential oil beautifully!</li>
            <li>I decided to use the third one in my son&#x27;s room to diffuse a peace and calm blend to help him sleep.</li>
            <li>This little diffuser is very powerful!</li>
            <li>Some of these run so expensive and this was a great buy</li>
            <li>I really like this Scent Pod Oil diffuser, the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a five star is because the motor makes a lot more noise than I expected.</li>
            <li>I use this everyday and love the way it works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much fragrance only.  </li>
            <li>Love it, use it everyday in my office.</li>
            <li>Other people who walk through my office notice the peppermint and enjoy the scent.</li>
            <li>This a very small but handy diffuser.</li>
            <li>Only gave it 4 stars because of the blue light with the power button.</li>
            <li>Cute little pod!  </li>
            <li>Love this little thing!</li>
            <li>Love this little diffuser!  </li>
            <li>I love this little thing!</li>
            <li>and the diffuser now makes a very loud noise when running.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised by how well</li>
            <li>I have this on my desk at work and the fan is very loud and distracting.</li>
            <li>The only thing that I have to say u want aware of</li>
            <li>I worked well and was quiet when I first received it.  </li>
            <li>Would buy again as long as it proves to be dependable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a small thing about the size of a computer mouse but is amazing in how it works.</li>
            <li>The scent doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as a candle type diffuser, but that&#x27;s ok, that could be the essential oils I used.</li>
            <li>and I purchased a very high grade lavender oil at a local store.</li>
            <li>Awkward to use, breaks easily, is not quiet, very bright leds and you have to buy specialized pads.</li>
            <li>The fan is loud and it doesn&#x27;t seem to put out as much scent as another one I have of the same style and size.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking that is my fault though by not reading the description clearly.</li>
            <li>It definitely smelled but not in the was whole room.</li>
            <li>It did not fill out tiny bathroom with as much scent as I wanted.</li>
            <li>I can plug this into a cell phone charger adaptor (pictured)&lt;br /&gt;but have been using just the batteries so far.</li>
            <li>The cord is long enough that it can placed on top of a dresser while plugged in, and not too long so that you will trip over it.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work because when it was quiet, it did what it was supposed to do, help my sleep.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it 4 stars simply because I&#x27;m a little nervous about the plastic tabs that hold the covers in place, but I&#x27;ve used it carefully several times for a few weeks now and so far, so good!  </li>
            <li>Its small, compact and easy to use.</li>
            <li>covers a very small area but better than nothing when traveling.  </li>
            <li>The fan was whisper quiet for the first two uses, but by the third it rattled really loudly.</li>
            <li>When I feel anxious or stressed I turn it on and one of my favorite essential oil fills my workspace.</li>
            <li>some have high notes, some have medium and some low.  </li>
            <li>Not great for large spaces but in office, bathroom, or bedroom depending on how large is just the right size.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is it would be nice to have a regular power cord</li>
            <li>The little blue light still comes on when you push the power button, but the fan no longer turns.</li>
            <li>Have it in the basement where my pets live and it has made a big difference.</li>
            <li>At first I wondered if something so small would be powerful enough to diffuse, but that&#x27;s definitely not an issue.</li>
            <li>Right out of the box had it working in less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>I returned it and spent a little more on an actual diffuser.</li>
            <li>was loud enough to bother me when I tried to go to sleep.</li>
            <li>This item is complete and total junk.</li>
            <li>I am truly surprised that Amazon is affiliated with sellers that produce such an inferior product.</li>
            <li>, I have this little guy right next to my bed on my nightstand.</li>
            <li>Works nicely but a little hard to open up</li>
            <li>warning, the blue light on the little button is crazy bright in the dark.</li>
            <li>Such a small item, but really powerful.  </li>
            <li>I really like this little guy.  </li>
            <li>I like this little defusser, but the second time I used it it was really noisy.</li>
            <li>Arrived broken,  got same unit from another seller (branded differently) that worked just fine, but this one didn&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last long though before having to add drops again.&lt;br /&gt;Was very quiet at first but at times the little fan can make noise.</li>

            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use an oil diffuser in my cubicle, so when I found this, I thought I would be a great alternative.  </li>
            <li> Lol.</li>
            <li> lol</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li> Very effective.</li>
            <li> I used Bergamot oil (just 5 drops), and within minutes my living area smelled amazing!</li>
            <li> Have one in each of my kids room that I diffuse a good night oil in which helps them sleep great.</li>
            <li> I am very happy!  :))</li>
            <li> Okay, it would get 5 stars, but I just got this an hour ago, and although it&#x27;s working wonderfully</li>
            <li> But bright.</li>
            <li> I bought this to put in the bathroom and diffuse in the mornings for a good wake up...</li>
            <li> and it does a good job.</li>
            <li> THE DIFFUSER WAS PACKAGED WELL AND ARRIVED IN GOOD CONDITION,  </li>
            <li> Works good for now with batteries.</li>
            <li> the light is very bright on off button.</li>
            <li> They make wonderful gifts as well as so useful  around the house.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with my Greenair Scent Pod Oil Diffuser.  </li>
            <li> By far the best travel diffuser I have and great for the price.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>

            <li> love that!</li>
            <li> Love it and would suggest it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Product works great and it got to me quickly!</li>
            <li> Our car smells amazing</li>
            <li> I diffused my peppermint oil, and my car smelled amazing.  </li>
            <li> The whole room smells wonderful now!&lt;br /&gt;Put</li>
            <li> Liked the scent pod, wish it were a mist humidifier with portability</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s my own fault for not reading the product description.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s working nicely.</li>
            <li> So handy.</li>
            <li> get one that diffuses with water, nice travel piece though.</li>
            <li> Nice compact unit.  </li>
            <li> It would make a nice gift for a colleague.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this diffuser.  </li>
            <li> My room smell so good love</li>
            <li> It spreads the fragrance nicely.</li>
            <li> Very good buy, powers right by my laptop/computer.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very easy to use.</li>
            <li> everyone really liked them very cute and very user-friendly would be a great Christmas gift stocking stuffer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to have one for my bathroom and for my own bedroom.</li>
            <li> But I wanted to use it at night while I sleep and the light is way to bright.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t have champagne expectations on a beer budget,  but for $11, I&#x27;m very happy so far.</li>
            <li> This company is by far 1 of the BEST I&#x27;ve ever ordered from.</li>
            <li> It would be great for a car, bathroom, nightstand right beside your bed, or on your end table like I&#x27;m doing.</li>
            <li> Easy!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a great whole room defuser!</li>
            <li> Very cheaply put together.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad this was my first purchase of a diffuser, it has been a great experience.</li>
            <li> And I love that you can either run it via usb cord (need adapter which is not included) or by batteries.</li>
            <li> I Love how portable this scent pod is.  </li>
            <li> also love that you have 2 options, a usb cord and batteries to use it.  </li>
            <li> Arrived on time, packaged well works &amp; looks as described, have purchased 2 more for additional gifts</li>
            <li> I purchased another brand and like it much better.</li>
            <li> This is the third one I have ordered, and they are great!  </li>
            <li> I use mine with batteries most of the time but can be plugged in when needed.  </li>
            <li> love the scent pod - but it says: can use with an ac adapter</li>
            <li> It definitely works great in his room!</li>
            <li> I plan to get more...</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of having the option to plug them in or use batteries.</li>
            <li> so well I can&#x27;t wait to purchase more.</li>
            <li> and I love that I can choose the oils I want to use.</li>
            <li> I have 2 planning on ordering much more for friends</li>
            <li> I love it, have it in my office at work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> This works ok.</li>
            <li> Love this pod.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> Love it, bought two one for my room one for my car...</li>
            <li> Will buy more for gifts..</li>
            <li> Love that it works off my pc because when I turn that off the fan goes off too.</li>
            <li> ( I may have to buy a couple more)  </li>
            <li> just okay.</li>
            <li> For an inexpensive diffuser, this is okay</li>
            <li> I think the best use is sitting next to you on a desk.</li>
            <li> I love how you can plug it in with the USB cord or, use the battery.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser.</li>
            <li> I use it in my office and love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I gave this a try.</li>
            <li> Love it...</li>
            <li> They are okay</li>
            <li> I like about this too, you can plug in any room at the most decrete place.</li>
            <li> Like most candle burning aromatherapy, you worry about refilling the water or replacing the tea candle before it dries out or burns out.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li> Also, if you need a stronger smell, put more drops of your EOs on the scent pad.</li>
            <li> However, for the price, I am pleased.</li>
            <li> I ordered a variety of oils to use in it, and have been pleased with them all.  </li>
            <li> love turning it on at my desk while working...</li>
            <li> I love that you can use batteries if you want to move it around or take it in your car even.</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend the InstaNatural Cool Mist Diffuser, I own it</li>
            <li> Since so many of these are $30, $40 and so much more, I didn&#x27;t hold out much hope for a good quality product.</li>
            <li> It is pretty bright at night, use it as a night light in my kids rooms but I don&#x27;t like it in my room as any kind of light bothers me when I am trying to sleep.</li>
            <li> So it is a very clean and easy diffuser to use.</li>
            <li> Very cool item,  </li>
            <li> My kids love it because it&#x27;s like a night light, but I prefer darkness when I sleep.  </li>
            <li> Everyone who comes into the office thinks it smells fantastic :)  </li>
            <li> They replaced the part and is working fantastic, I really Love this device.</li>
            <li> Great product arrived a day early</li>
            <li> I just plug it into my computer and have a beautiful essential oil scent to enjoy!  </li>
            <li> Cute but cheap.  </li>
            <li> SO FAR IT HAS WORKED GREAT</li>
            <li> I wish it had some kind of heating element, instead of just a fan to blow the fragrance around, but at this price point, I feel it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> I ordered these thinking they would be a good addition to the scentbug that I already had as they run on usb power, but they really dont seem to have the power that the scentbug has.</li>
            <li> I used one of the original pads to draw an outline and cut out for more pads from a sheet of felt I purchased at a craft store.  </li>
            <li> This feature makes them easily portable.</li>
            <li> this gadget easy to use cheap to opperate</li>
            <li> It is a perfect little addition to my offices.</li>
            <li> This little pod works great!</li>
            <li> Great little product to keep a room smelling good and fresh.  </li>
            <li> These are loud (the fan) and the light is way too bright for night time.</li>
            <li> A GREAT alternative way to enjoy my essential oils.</li>
            <li> but if keep next to your bed at night, it works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks now and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> The Aromafier refill pads fit this</li>
            <li> It runs very quite and diffuses the oil nicely.</li>
            <li> a fart is more powerful than this s</li>
            <li> Very happy with my Green Air Scent POD oil diffuser</li>
            <li> and I liked it so much I bought three for gifts and</li>
            <li> the fan and sound machine help drown it out some.</li>
            <li> Great gift idea for essential oil lovers.</li>
            <li> I enjoy them both.</li>
            <li> Not what I excepted its can of cheap and will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my toddlers bedroom (13 x 9) and it does a fantastic job of diffusing the scent throughout his room.</li>
            <li> After I let them know the product was defective, they immediately sent me out a replacement free of charge.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> It runs quietly and is perfect for setting on my night table to diffuse my oils without inundating the whole house.</li>
            <li> They diffuse my peppermint oil which is not too potent but just right.</li>
            <li> It scents up my space pretty good with out much noise.  </li>
            <li> Excellent small diffuser.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for a small room, a bathroom, or the car.</li>
            <li> But for a small space, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> If it does I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for smaller desk areas, and plugs up easily to your USB port (and I&#x27;m a total techno-phobe).  </li>
            <li> HOWEVER you do most certainly get what you paid for (I paid $10).</li>
            <li> Just the right size!</li>
            <li> This diffuser is great at providing a nice subtle stream of scent.  </li>
            <li> I use only my Youngevity Essential Oils in it and specifically enjoy our Peppermint and change off to our Spearmint for a clean wonderful aroma.</li>
            <li> Works great, just wish the fan was a little more powerful</li>
            <li> smell is strong right away, and fades quickly.</li>
            <li> If an oil is particularly sweet</li>
            <li> Love this it works really well in my car.  </li>
            <li> This is OK, it does not give out any mist, so the aroma was much stronger.</li>
            <li> It sounds like the fan is hitting something, and based on many reviews, I think this is unusual.</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> What I love is the smells are all natural and not  flowery and chemical ridden!!!</li>
            <li> However, I have it right on my desk at work and enjoy the fact that I don&#x27;t have to use water with it.</li>
            <li> My whole office smells great and it is quiet as can be.</li>
            <li> This is really neat- good air diffusion with the fan, quiet, bright blue light helps you see it and remember if you need to turn it off.  </li>
            <li> Works great, love how small it is!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more for all cars and the bedrooms!</li>
            <li> There are diffusers that blow more air but that causes the oil to dry up faster and uses more battery power.</li>
            <li> but this is a great little diffuser.  </li>
            <li> This is a great little scent pod.  </li>
            <li> GREAT LITTLE DIFFUSER.</li>
            <li> Great little diffuser, until it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The power light is a little bright, but doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> Cheap doesn&#x27;t really work</li>
            <li> But, it filled the whole room.</li>
            <li> Wish I spent more and got something better</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice diffuser and works quietly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and super quiet!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just right.</li>
            <li> I have the pod right on my desk.  </li>
            <li> Right now mine is running on batteries.</li>
            <li> This is a great little diffuser!</li>
            <li> Great little gizmo for $10!</li>
            <li> Works fine but not as good as a more expensive diffuser mist.</li>
            <li> The new 1 seems to be working just fine</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for small spaces and needs no water.</li>
            <li> If you want a little aromatherapy right beside you, or in a smaller rooms, it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> It is not one to diffuse for an entire room but bathrooms (or super small areas) are great!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but wished it had a little more power.</li>
            <li> Spend a little more for better quality.</li>
            <li> The water diffusers are wonderful, but expensive and mine seem to burn out pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Its ok for a kids small room or to take in the car I assumed it would be bigger, but works great in my daughters room</li>
            <li> Works great and small enough to be out of my way I love it</li>
            <li> I love plugging it into my computer and having a waft of scent right next to me at my desk.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting very much</li>
            <li> Super easy to use, discreet design and quiet.  </li>
            <li> I have it at work and for the most part it&#x27;s very quiet.  </li>
            <li> so I moved it to the mantle which is much higher to keep it out of reach.</li>
            <li> I have it in my living room with four or five drops of lavender and it fills the room pretty well.</li>
            <li> I have 3 and set the first one up in my living room.</li>
            <li> They were fantastic when I went directly to the company about my unit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Mine have been running consistently for about a week without being shut off</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be getting more of these in the future!</li>
            <li> My first one made some noise after about 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li> LOVE IT as it sites quietly on my desk at work!  </li>
            <li> but I am hoping it might be better in a smaller area ?</li>
            <li> I only use it for 15 mins at the most to help the ordor and turn it off when I leave for work.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> Not expensive too.</li>
            <li> The first one did not work at all.  </li>
            <li> So I made sure it was actually working.</li>
            <li> Pretty.</li>
            <li> A colleague of mine had bought something similar, and I enjoyed the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I used batteries my first day &amp; they died within a couple hours.</li>
            <li> The on /off button stopped working the first week</li>
            <li> If it lasts a while I&#x27;ll buy more for other rooms, the price is right!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t add humidity like other diffusers but it&#x27;s nice for my office.</li>
            <li> It really takes care of a large room!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s great because I can have a different pad for energizing blends and mental clarity too.  </li>
            <li> but you really need to keep them very close to you to be able to smell your essential oils.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very compact &amp; works well after first adding drops.</li>
            <li> It emits scent for a small space which is good for me.</li>
            <li> The included USB cable has a good amount of length to it, freeing you up to move the diffuser further away, if you prefer a more subtle scent.  </li>
            <li> It comes with pads easy to put essential on, and lasts for hours!</li>
            <li> Well, Comes with USB cord, Easy to Set Up, Very Quiet</li>
            <li> Well made, compact, easy to change pads for different oils.  </li>
            <li> This is easy to travel with and quiet.</li>
            <li> It fits well on the console and the fan is strong enough to fill my midsize car.</li>
            <li> - doesn&#x27;t fill a large space with scent, doesn&#x27;t fully diffuse all scents in a blend, need to replace the diffuser pads to change the scent (it comes with 3)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;CONS: Smell won&#x27;t fill a large room, Will run through batteries if not using USB cord&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;-This is not intended to fill a large room.</li>
            <li> Again, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for a large space.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t diffuse a large area.</li>
            <li> I contacted the company and they sent out a new one right away.  </li>
            <li> I put it next to the bed with 2 drops of lavender on the pad and it worked jut fine.</li>
            <li> and I use lemongrass and rosemary essential oils as a quick pick-me-up!</li>
            <li> Nice little scent maker.  </li>
            <li> This item uses large scent pads (comes with several) that you drop your oil on and enjoy.</li>
            <li> Great little diffuser, exceptionally quiet.  </li>
            <li> It has started making such a huge rattling noise that I can&#x27;t use it at my desk anymore because it disturbs me and everyone around me.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is how bright the light is on the on/off button.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t take up much space, but work</li>
            <li> it work&#x27;s very well.</li>
            <li> suggest looking at the more expensive alternatives from the same company and spend more on a better product.</li>
            <li> Mine is in a bathroom and it fills the room very well.</li>
            <li> I took it to work and it made to much noise to use it.</li>
            <li> I really like how this works</li>
            <li> But what I can&#x27;t stand is the brightness of the light and the noise the inner fan makes.</li>
            <li> Very flimsy and unreliable device.</li>
            <li> I soaked the pad when I was not getting much of a scent</li>
            <li> but that really didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot on a diffuser.</li>
            <li> But I really wanted to give diffusing incense oils a try.</li>
            <li> But, it does put the smell out in the room very well</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> So, I am not using it quite as much anymore.</li>
            <li> Works ok but no real instructions</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like it really gets the scent out into the air</li>
            <li> I got this for diffusing in the car and it works very well.</li>
            <li> so I really didnt know what to expect.</li>
            <li> The following day it came on right away, but when I unplugged it to add some more oil to the pad, I never got it to come back on again.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Wow, these rock!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little smaller than I had expected it to be but that just makes it more convenient Loving it!</li>
            <li> Not loud at all - I could easily fall asleep to it -</li>
            <li> I have ordered two more to use in other rooms.</li>
            <li> More than worth the small price.</li>
            <li> Great little dry diffuser.</li>
            <li> Even so, it&#x27;s a great little diffuser for single oils</li>
            <li> Have to have it right next to your face to be aware of the scent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been reading up on different single oils and each have their own note-</li>
            <li> Nice and small.</li>
            <li> I use more essential oil on this than the regular oil diffuser.  </li>
            <li> Super simple setup &amp; replacements.</li>
            <li> it puts out a decent stream.</li>
            <li> I have a decent sized office and I can hear the fan in the hallway.</li>
            <li> Aroma filled our large living room, so now I know only one or two drops of essential oil will certainly do the trick in the truck.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a strong scent but good enough to turn the basement into a spa.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> it up high</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these, as well as the brand.</li>
            <li> I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT HIGHLY.</li>
            <li> I love these little things.</li>
            <li> absolutely love this little guy.</li>
            <li> Cute little item, does the trick.  </li>
            <li> We absolutely love these little diffusers.  </li>
            <li> This cute little oil diffuser has a convenient USB plug-in option, which is why I bought it for my office, but it rattles.</li>
            <li> May be good for a larger area but for my office, the scent is a little over bearing to handle, for me!</li>
            <li> The batteries last a long time and this little gem diffuses the essential oil beautifully!</li>
            <li> I decided to use the third one in my son&#x27;s room to diffuse a peace and calm blend to help him sleep.</li>
            <li> This little diffuser is very powerful!</li>
            <li> Some of these run so expensive and this was a great buy</li>
            <li> I really like this Scent Pod Oil diffuser, the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a five star is because the motor makes a lot more noise than I expected.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and love the way it works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much fragrance only.  </li>
            <li> Love it, use it everyday in my office.</li>
            <li> Other people who walk through my office notice the peppermint and enjoy the scent.</li>
            <li> This a very small but handy diffuser.</li>
            <li> Only gave it 4 stars because of the blue light with the power button.</li>
            <li> Cute little pod!  </li>
            <li> Love this little thing!</li>
            <li> Love this little diffuser!  </li>
            <li> I love this little thing!</li>
            <li> and the diffuser now makes a very loud noise when running.  </li>
            <li> I was very surprised by how well</li>
            <li> I have this on my desk at work and the fan is very loud and distracting.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I have to say u want aware of</li>
            <li> I worked well and was quiet when I first received it.  </li>
            <li> Would buy again as long as it proves to be dependable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a small thing about the size of a computer mouse but is amazing in how it works.</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as a candle type diffuser, but that&#x27;s ok, that could be the essential oils I used.</li>
            <li> and I purchased a very high grade lavender oil at a local store.</li>
            <li> Awkward to use, breaks easily, is not quiet, very bright leds and you have to buy specialized pads.</li>
            <li> The fan is loud and it doesn&#x27;t seem to put out as much scent as another one I have of the same style and size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking that is my fault though by not reading the description clearly.</li>
            <li> It definitely smelled but not in the was whole room.</li>
            <li> It did not fill out tiny bathroom with as much scent as I wanted.</li>
            <li> I can plug this into a cell phone charger adaptor (pictured)&lt;br /&gt;but have been using just the batteries so far.</li>
            <li> The cord is long enough that it can placed on top of a dresser while plugged in, and not too long so that you will trip over it.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work because when it was quiet, it did what it was supposed to do, help my sleep.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it 4 stars simply because I&#x27;m a little nervous about the plastic tabs that hold the covers in place, but I&#x27;ve used it carefully several times for a few weeks now and so far, so good!  </li>
            <li> Its small, compact and easy to use.</li>
            <li> covers a very small area but better than nothing when traveling.  </li>
            <li> The fan was whisper quiet for the first two uses, but by the third it rattled really loudly.</li>
            <li> When I feel anxious or stressed I turn it on and one of my favorite essential oil fills my workspace.</li>
            <li> some have high notes, some have medium and some low.  </li>
            <li> Not great for large spaces but in office, bathroom, or bedroom depending on how large is just the right size.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is it would be nice to have a regular power cord</li>
            <li> The little blue light still comes on when you push the power button, but the fan no longer turns.</li>
            <li> Have it in the basement where my pets live and it has made a big difference.</li>
            <li> At first I wondered if something so small would be powerful enough to diffuse, but that&#x27;s definitely not an issue.</li>
            <li> Right out of the box had it working in less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I returned it and spent a little more on an actual diffuser.</li>
            <li> was loud enough to bother me when I tried to go to sleep.</li>
            <li> This item is complete and total junk.</li>
            <li> I am truly surprised that Amazon is affiliated with sellers that produce such an inferior product.</li>
            <li> , I have this little guy right next to my bed on my nightstand.</li>
            <li> Works nicely but a little hard to open up</li>
            <li> warning, the blue light on the little button is crazy bright in the dark.</li>
            <li> Such a small item, but really powerful.  </li>
            <li> I really like this little guy.  </li>
            <li> I like this little defusser, but the second time I used it it was really noisy.</li>
            <li> Arrived broken,  got same unit from another seller (branded differently) that worked just fine, but this one didn&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long though before having to add drops again.&lt;br /&gt;Was very quiet at first but at times the little fan can make noise.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall if you only need to fill a small space - and I mean SMALL space - this is a great budget item.  </li>
            <li> In a blend, the only ones I can smell are the very low or very high notes, I can&#x27;t usually smell the middle notes which balance out the scent.  </li>
            <li> Batteries seem to last a long time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not going to travel across rooms or anything, but as long as your within 5 ft</li>
            <li> So far this little thing does a big job.</li>
            <li> Gets very loud after a few uses.</li>
            <li> The last 5 months it&#x27;s been making noise like something is loose inside although I can&#x27;t find anything.  </li>
            <li> I rated this earlier with the same complaint and was contacted by seller immediately offering a new one and an apology.  </li>
            <li> This is by FAR the neatest little machine.</li>
            <li> : I had to return my little machine, so bummed out that the motor started rattling loudly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taking it in the car and plugged in as a usb for long car rides too.</li>
            <li> I also use with alot of other different oils, I just change the pad with whatever oil I am using.</li>
            <li> It diffuses enough oil to get rid of the fleas and other pests.</li>
            <li> Sometimes if I don&#x27;t close it properly the fan makes a little grating noise, but then I adjust and it goes on silently wafting aromatherapy in my direction.</li>
            <li> works but not for very long, feel like I am wasting my oil.</li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;-It came with a few extra filter pads, but you can make more by tracing onto felt and cutting out to fit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The batteries are lasting about a week and a half</li>
            <li> One thing I suggest is you can use little cotton pads cut in the same shape without getting the replacements!</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this company as well as this little machine.</li>
            <li> It was a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is not as quiet as I would like.  </li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all.  </li>
            <li> Received in a timely manner and was as expected.</li>
            <li> It still works well but have to be careful when you pick it up or it will fall apart.</li>
            <li> No real noticeable difference</li>
            <li> I ordered a few different types of these.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise Thank you Green Air for going above and beyond!!!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Last weekend though the fan started making a weird irritating noise making the device more of a nuisance.</li>
            <li> The 2nd day I had trouble getting it to come on when I pressed the button.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint was the delivery box was not properly sealed, shipping list missing and possibly a diffuser or two.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mental focus EO to hopefully help me concentrate while doing homework.</li>
            <li> I plugged it into my computer after adding a few drops of my essential oil to the felt pad inside</li>
            <li> I really hate to give it only 2 stars, because well it&#x27;s adorably cute</li>
            <li> Not very powerful (given the price, what can one expect?).</li>
            <li> I notice that the scent does not last as long, and the fan inside would sometimes spin slow at times.  </li>
            <li> On the second day the bottom part broke, one of the little nibs broke off so it will not close tight anymore.</li>
            <li> However, given the rude people around me who enjoy making incessant personal calls and cutting their fingernails at their desk, frankly I don&#x27;t care.  </li>
            <li> The diffuser runs quietly and effectively.&lt;br /&gt;Great for use in small spaces.</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re going to be using it to fill a larger space than a small cubicle or car</li>
            <li> Customer service from seller is above and beyond what they need to do for a small purchase.  </li>
            <li> essential oils go onto a small filter pad.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it does spread out the scent of the oils.</li>
            <li> Only airs in small area,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small but gives enough scent for just 5 drops.</li>
            <li> I bought two one for the Living room the other in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because I never heard anything.</li>
            <li> One star is being extremely generous.</li>
            <li> The greenair scent pod was exactly as expected!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough for my work space where I use a mix of lemon, peppermint, basil, rosemary &amp; grapefruit oil to infuse!</li>
            <li> There customer service is sending me a new bottom cover to replace the broken part</li>
            <li> Not really worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now on my second unit and it at least worked for a couple of weeks before the noise started.  </li>
            <li> Even in my small office I can only smell the oil for a few minutes before it stops working well.  </li>
            <li> Also the pad holder wouldn&#x27;t stick (maybe something else broke down there?).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like throwing money down the drain.</li>
            <li> It definitely is only for a very small area like your desk.</li>
            <li> It takes less than 60 seconds to  add oil to the pad and turn it on.</li>
            <li> Disappointed because it filled my classroom with aroma.</li>
            <li> A little goes</li>
            <li> This little cutie pie comes with me to work</li>
            <li> Not very pleased with this little thing anymore.</li>
            <li> My only disappointment is in that I cannot plug it in, it is battery or computer plug in only.</li>
            <li> Had it running in a few minutes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been running it non-stop for close to a week and the batteries are still good.&lt;br /&gt;-There is virtually no sound from the fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had the the diffuser for a few days and then it broke.  </li>
            <li> I was very gently with this unit so it may have been just a bad part from the begining.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t drop it though or the fan will rattle pretty bad.</li>
            <li> The fan did start rattling after the first few uses which is a little annoying but</li>
            <li> This is the cutest and easiest to use little oil diffuser!  </li>
            <li> Horrible and very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I usually put in something for allergies and stress</li>
            <li> but it is insanely difficult to open the scent compartment.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s usually the overpowering one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works for what we got it for, sleep aid diffuser in our son&#x27;s small room.</li>
            <li> Small, Smell Fills the Room</li>
            <li> /&gt;-The size is small.</li>
            <li> Difficult to open.</li>
            <li> and I would encourage anyone who needs a small diffuser to get this.</li>
            <li> Small but will spread the scent through two rooms (living room &amp; bathroom) within 3 mins..</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it in a small confined area like a car yet  </li>
            <li> Of course this happens about 3 days past the return expiration date.</li>
            <li> No more having to use spray air freshener.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure yet how dependable it will be.</li>
            <li> The machine won&#x27;t fill 1 small room with the sents</li>
            <li> It does not produce a mist,there is a small fan inside that allows the oils to be stirred up and released into the air.</li>
            <li> Hard to smell the oils</li>
            <li> This product hardly diffuses oils at all.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> It made her office seem at least a touch spa-like.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it was so small and ran on batteries!</li>
            <li> I ended up cutting a small piece of black paper &amp; taping it to the button.</li>
            <li> This one was disappointing- the little clip part in the front broke off almost immediately</li>
            <li> I would have given it another star if it weren&#x27;t for the fact that it is poorly made.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this</li>
            <li> I was mostly afraid it would be noisy and sporadic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s depressing.  </li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> Piece of crap.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t regret it but will if you try to save on this worthless hunk of plastic.</li>
            <li> Piece of Crap.</li>
            <li> piece of crap!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works great, just wish the fan was a little more powerful but if keep next to your bed at night, it works great.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the price!</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time.  I have it at work and for the most part it&#x27;s very quiet.  I think you would hear the fan if it was absolutely quiet in my office, which is never the case.  Not loud at all - I could easily fall asleep to it - it&#x27;s that quiet (not at work of course).  Cute little pod!  Portable!  I can toss it in my car on weekends for that added aroma!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my bedroom!  And I love that you can either run it via usb cord (need adapter which is not included) or by batteries.</li>
            <li> I have it on my desk at work.  I plug it into my computer and it works great.  The diffuser runs quietly and effectively.&lt;br /&gt;Great for use in small spaces.</li>
            <li> I love these little things. I use them with my essential oils all over the house. Have one in each of my kids room that I diffuse a good night oil in which helps them sleep great. I also use with alot of other different oils, I just change the pad with whatever oil I am using. Is very quiet while it is on. Only gave it 4 stars because of the blue light with the power button. It is pretty bright at night, use it as a night light in my kids rooms but I don&#x27;t like it in my room as any kind of light bothers me when I am trying to sleep. Also the &amp;#34;plug in&amp;#34; which comes with it actually plugs into your computer or you have to use an adapter to plug into the wall, which doesn&#x27;t bother me as so does all of our cell phones so we have plenty around my house.</li>
            <li> I have this at my desk at work, I use it multiple times a day! I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks now and it works perfectly. Like others have said this isn&#x27;t like a steam diffuser and won&#x27;t perform like that. However, I have it right on my desk at work and enjoy the fact that I don&#x27;t have to use water with it. I use about 5-6 drops of oil on the pad and I think it lasts me about 2-3 days depending on how often I&#x27;m diffusing throughout the day. Great price! Two of my coworkers also bought these!</li>
            <li> I have one in each of my offices and both diffusers work beautifully! They diffuse my peppermint oil which is not too potent but just right. Other people who walk through my office notice the peppermint and enjoy the scent. It is a perfect little addition to my offices.</li>
            <li> I use it for sleeping. I put it next to the bed with 2 drops of lavender on the pad and it worked jut fine.</li>
            <li> I Love how portable this scent pod is.  I used it at both my office jobs to diffuse Germfighter (ie. Theives oil).&lt;br /&gt;I also love that you have 2 options, a usb cord and batteries to use it.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this to put in the bathroom and diffuse in the mornings for a good wake up...and I LOVE it!  It is not one to diffuse for an entire room but bathrooms (or super small areas) are great!  I am very happy!  :))</li>
            <li> I really like this little guy.  Just got him today, so I can&#x27;t speak to durability, but he seems to be relatively well made.  The included USB cable has a good amount of length to it, freeing you up to move the diffuser further away, if you prefer a more subtle scent.  I wish it had some kind of heating element, instead of just a fan to blow the fragrance around, but at this price point, I feel it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> Love it! The power light is a little bright, but doesn&#x27;t bother me. Works really great and it&#x27;s so portable!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it was so small and ran on batteries! Not what I expected at all.  However, the customer service at GreenAir was the best I have ever seen. The president called me about it!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, packaged well works &amp; looks as described, have purchased 2 more for additional gifts</li>
            <li> These are loud (the fan) and the light is way too bright for night time. These are not the best. I purchased another brand and like it much better.</li>
            <li> I really like this Scent Pod Oil diffuser, the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a five star is because the motor makes a lot more noise than I expected.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try a diffuser and essential oil for sleeping.  I chose this diffuser because it can run on both electricity and batteries, making it portable. I wasn&#x27;t expecting very much but this is a great little diffuser.  It is very easy to use and super quiet!  I have ordered two more to use in other rooms.</li>
            <li> smell is strong right away, and fades quickly. i add water to pad to help it linger, sorta eh about this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but wished it had a little more power. takes a while for the diffuser to get the essential oil fragrance out.</li>
            <li> The fan is loud and it doesn&#x27;t seem to put out as much scent as another one I have of the same style and size.</li>
            <li> Cheap doesn&#x27;t really work</li>
            <li> Arrived broken,  got same unit from another seller (branded differently) that worked just fine, but this one didn&#x27;t work at all.  So disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my office and it&#x27;s great. Love it!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  My only complaint is how bright the light is on the on/off button.  My kids love it because it&#x27;s like a night light, but I prefer darkness when I sleep.  Otherwise, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent small diffuser. Perfect for classrooms, cars, and bathrooms.</li>
            <li> Gets very loud after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!  This works great in the car and at work.  I usually put in something for allergies and stress but it&#x27;s great because I can have a different pad for energizing blends and mental clarity too.  Everyone who comes into the office thinks it smells fantastic :)  The Aromafier refill pads fit this and I have pads for different oil combinations.</li>
            <li> Great little dry diffuser. Doesn&#x27;t add humidity like other diffusers but it&#x27;s nice for my office.</li>
            <li> This is the third one I have ordered, and they are great!  They make wonderful gifts as well as so useful  around the house.  I use mine with batteries most of the time but can be plugged in when needed.  Size is great for night stand or pillow or traveling.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm.  I bought it for the truck, and tested it in the house.  Aroma filled our large living room, so now I know only one or two drops of essential oil will certainly do the trick in the truck.  Works great on both batteries and USB cord.  Very quiet.</li>
            <li> love the scent pod - but it says: can use with an ac adapter but I can&#x27;t find anyone that sells that part</li>
            <li> Received in a timely manner and was as expected. It runs very quite and diffuses the oil nicely. On the second day the bottom part broke, one of the little nibs broke off so it will not close tight anymore. It still works well but have to be careful when you pick it up or it will fall apart. I was very gently with this unit so it may have been just a bad part from the begining. They replaced the part and is working fantastic, I really Love this device. I give it 5 Starts and recommend to buy it.  There customer service is sending me a new bottom cover to replace the broken part I now will give it 5 star rating. Excellent customer service. I recommend this product as a definite buy.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and love the way it works.</li>
            <li> I just got this today. It is wonderful. It&#x27;s perfect for a small room, a bathroom, or the car. Not overpowering. It&#x27;s just right. I will definitely be purchasing more for all cars and the bedrooms!</li>
            <li> No real noticeable difference</li>
            <li> Perfect size for my office space.</li>
            <li> Would have given it 1 star but it actually turns on. The scent just doesnt fill the room like described or at all for that matter.</li>
            <li> I bought this to take to the hospital with me when I have my 3rd baby here shortly.&lt;br /&gt;I decided I needed to try it before I bring it. So I put 5 drops of oil in it and set it on the table. It definitely smelled but not in the was whole room. It was going to work for what I bought it for so I was happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;Then my son started messing with it so I moved it to the mantle which is much higher to keep it out of reach. The whole room smells wonderful now!&lt;br /&gt;Put it up high and it&#x27;s a great whole room defuser! Highly recommend it! I&#x27;m buying one for all my bathrooms now too!</li>
            <li> This is a great little diffuser! I have it in my living room with four or five drops of lavender and it fills the room pretty well. If it lasts a while I&#x27;ll buy more for other rooms, the price is right!</li>
            <li> It was a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> Great product arrived a day early and I use them both daily.</li>
            <li> piece of crap! a fart is more powerful than this s***!</li>
            <li> Wow, these rock!!! I&#x27;m big on diffusing essential oils. At first I wondered if something so small would be powerful enough to diffuse, but that&#x27;s definitely not an issue. I have 3 and set the first one up in my living room. I used Bergamot oil (just 5 drops), and within minutes my living area smelled amazing! I set the second one up in the kitchen and used Lemongrass EO. Perfect! I decided to use the third one in my son&#x27;s room to diffuse a peace and calm blend to help him sleep. It definitely works great in his room! I plan to get more...I&#x27;d love to have one for my bathroom and for my own bedroom. I love the convenience of having the option to plug them in or use batteries. This feature makes them easily portable. In fact, I might buy one just for trips to use in hotel rooms. They don&#x27;t take up much space, but work so well I can&#x27;t wait to purchase more. I highly recommend these, as well as the brand. They also come with extra pads (each one comes with three), which means they&#x27;ll last even longet before needing replacements.</li>
            <li> This little pod works great! I keep it in my car and use the USB cord to plug it in. Our car smells amazing and I love that I can choose the oils I want to use.</li>
            <li> Excellent usb or battery powered diffuser. It comes with pads easy to put essential on, and lasts for hours! Great price and product I have 2 planning on ordering much more for friends</li>
            <li> I ordered a few different types of these.  This one was disappointing- the little clip part in the front broke off almost immediately and the diffuser now makes a very loud noise when running.  The others i have are virtually silent.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this type again.</li>
            <li> Love this little thing! Perfect for my room. Not great for large spaces but in office, bathroom, or bedroom depending on how large is just the right size. Very effective.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my Green Air Scent POD oil diffuser it work&#x27;s very well.</li>
            <li> Would have been great but it is insanely difficult to open the scent compartment. Because if this I do not recommend buying this item.</li>
            <li> I love it, have it in my office at work. Plan to buy another for home.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok. It definitely is only for a very small area like your desk.</li>
            <li> This a very small but handy diffuser. I can carry it back and forth from the house to the shop. My only disappointment is in that I cannot plug it in, it is battery or computer plug in only.</li>
            <li> Bought a diffuser for myself and I liked it so much I bought three for gifts and everyone really liked them very cute and very user-friendly would be a great Christmas gift stocking stuffer</li>
            <li> This works ok. It did not fill out tiny bathroom with as much scent as I wanted. But it does it&#x27;s job enough.</li>
            <li> Liked the scent pod, wish it were a mist humidifier with portability</li>
            <li> This is a great little scent pod.  I like that it does not use water and therefore will not &amp;#34;dry out&amp;#34; and possibly crack.  It comes with a usb adapter and I use my phone aoutlet charger to run it.  I can run it all night and not worry about it.  It emits scent for a small space which is good for me.</li>
            <li> Piece of crap. While it does work the way it was designed you won&#x27;t be happy with it. Awkward to use, breaks easily, is not quiet, very bright leds and you have to buy specialized pads. (To say that The Company that makes it is Excellent.) They were fantastic when I went directly to the company about my unit.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest looking at the more expensive alternatives from the same company and spend more on a better product. You won&#x27;t regret it but will if you try to save on this worthless hunk of plastic. Otherwise Thank you Green Air for going above and beyond!!!</li>
            <li> Love this pod. Only needs a couple drops of essential oil to produce scent and it lasts hours.  Great for work or on the go</li>
            <li> I ordered this thinking it was a vapor diffuser but that&#x27;s my own fault for not reading the product description.  Even so, it&#x27;s a great little diffuser for single oils but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for a blend.  I&#x27;ve been reading up on different single oils and each have their own note- some have high notes, some have medium and some low.  In a blend, the only ones I can smell are the very low or very high notes, I can&#x27;t usually smell the middle notes which balance out the scent.  If an oil is particularly sweet that&#x27;s usually the overpowering one.&lt;br /&gt;Understandably this is a budget item.  For $15 it&#x27;s a great portable diffuser but if you&#x27;re going to be using it to fill a larger space than a small cubicle or car I&#x27;d recommend the InstaNatural Cool Mist Diffuser, I own it and it&#x27;s awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Overall Pros and Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Pro - cost, portability, no automatic shut off or supervision required since it doesn&#x27;t use heat, no heat to damage the oil qualities, it&#x27;s quiet&lt;br /&gt;Cons - doesn&#x27;t fill a large space with scent, doesn&#x27;t fully diffuse all scents in a blend, need to replace the diffuser pads to change the scent (it comes with 3)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall if you only need to fill a small space - and I mean SMALL space - this is a great budget item.  Mine have been running consistently for about a week without being shut off and I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> Its ok for a kids small room or to take in the car I assumed it would be bigger, but works great in my daughters room</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!! I have the pod right on my desk.  When I feel anxious or stressed I turn it on and one of my favorite essential oil fills my workspace.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t  what I expect. Do not like at all.</li>
            <li> I bought it to take traveling and I think it will work great.</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for. Not what I expected. Very cheaply put together.</li>
            <li> It works for what we got it for, sleep aid diffuser in our son&#x27;s small room. about 4-7 drops fills the room all night. The fan did start rattling after the first few uses which is a little annoying but the fan and sound machine help drown it out some. I rated this earlier with the same complaint and was contacted by seller immediately offering a new one and an apology.  Unit is about what I&#x27;d expect for $10. Customer service from seller is above and beyond what they need to do for a small purchase.  Would recommend buying from them.</li>
            <li> PROS: Small, Smell Fills the Room Well, Comes with USB cord, Easy to Set Up, Very Quiet, Cost&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Smell won&#x27;t fill a large room, Will run through batteries if not using USB cord&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY EXPERIENCE:&lt;br /&gt;-Received faster than expected.&lt;br /&gt;-Setup was very simple. Had it running in a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;-The size is small. It is about the size of my palm.&lt;br /&gt;-Your essential oils go onto a small filter pad. A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;-It came with a few extra filter pads, but you can make more by tracing onto felt and cutting out to fit.&lt;br /&gt;-This is not intended to fill a large room. Mine is in a bathroom and it fills the room very well. Actually, the scent starts moving into the adjacent room. I was very surprised by how well is disperses the scent!&lt;br /&gt;-Do yourself a favor and get an adapter to plug it into the wall. Right now mine is running on batteries. I have been running it non-stop for close to a week and the batteries are still good.&lt;br /&gt;-There is virtually no sound from the fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION:&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this little guy. I use several diffusers throughout my home to diffuse essential oils...in all different price ranges. You cannot beat this price for it&#x27;s performance. Again, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for a large space. But for a small space, it&#x27;s perfect. I plan to purchase one for every bathroom and my husband&#x27;s desk at work.</li>
            <li> This is the cutest and easiest to use little oil diffuser!  I just plug it into my computer and have a beautiful essential oil scent to enjoy!  I&#x27;ll be getting more of these in the future!</li>
            <li> A diffuser  I can use with my patients  in the hospital.</li>
            <li> I took it to work and it made to much noise to use it.</li>
            <li> Love it, bought two one for my room one for my car... Will buy more for gifts..</li>
            <li> Works really great.  Love that it works off my pc because when I turn that off the fan goes off too.</li>
            <li> Lasted 6 weeks and then quit working</li>
            <li> Just got it today.. So far so good! It&#x27;s a little smaller than I had expected it to be but that just makes it more convenient Loving it!</li>
            <li> Works well, have to refill the filter each time I use it</li>
            <li> I really like how this works I can take it anywhere and the price was excellent.  But I wanted to use it at night while I sleep and the light is way to bright.</li>
            <li> I really hate to give it only 2 stars, because well it&#x27;s adorably cute and it works well. But what I can&#x27;t stand is the brightness of the light and the noise the inner fan makes. I had it in my car, and I had to crank up the radio so I wouldn&#x27;t hear the noise. One I had in my bathroom which is about 20 feet away from my bed was loud enough to bother me when I tried to go to sleep. I tried to take the plastic cover below the fan out, no it didn&#x27;t help. I am returning all three of them that I bought.</li>
            <li> I got one for myself and one for my husband. ( I may have to buy a couple more)  The batteries last a long time and this little gem diffuses the essential oil beautifully!</li>
            <li> Very flimsy and unreliable device. After using it for about a week, the connecting part on the back broke off. Also the pad holder wouldn&#x27;t stick (maybe something else broke down there?). It would still work, however, so I ignored these issues. Last weekend though the fan started making a weird irritating noise making the device more of a nuisance. Other than that, it does spread out the scent of the oils.</li>
            <li> Works just okay. Not very powerful (given the price, what can one expect?). I would have given it another star if it weren&#x27;t for the fact that it is poorly made. Difficult to open.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It came with the adapter!!  Works great!</li>
            <li> Perfect for the office</li>
            <li> Not really worth the money. I returned it and spent a little more on an actual diffuser. Spend a little more for better quality.</li>
            <li> Nice and small. Can sit in anywhere. I have problems with fleas in the cabin this year so I close all windows and doors and let the diffuser run overnight just using 2 AA batteries. It&#x27;s still running in the morning. It diffuses enough oil to get rid of the fleas and other pests. There are diffusers that blow more air but that causes the oil to dry up faster and uses more battery power. I can plug this into a cell phone charger adaptor (pictured)&lt;br /&gt;but have been using just the batteries so far.</li>
            <li> For an inexpensive diffuser, this is okay but it doesn&#x27;t diffuse a large area. I sit it next to my daughter when she is doing school work and it does a good job.</li>
            <li> Had the same issue used it once ,now cannot open it at all tried everything</li>
            <li> Have to have it right next to your face to be aware of the scent and I purchased a very high grade lavender oil at a local store. I soaked the pad when I was not getting much of a scent but that really didn&#x27;t help much. HOWEVER you do most certainly get what you paid for (I paid $10). I think the best use is sitting next to you on a desk.</li>
            <li> I must not have read the description all the way. It was not quite what I wanted but, it works. Can get a bit noisy in a quiet room.</li>
            <li> Cute but cheap.  I had it on my desk at work plugged into my laptop.  The 2nd day I had trouble getting it to come on when I pressed the button.  I gave up but left it plugged in.  About 1/2 through the day it came on and worked the rest of the day.  The following day it came on right away, but when I unplugged it to add some more oil to the pad, I never got it to come back on again.&lt;br /&gt;The 3rd day it wouldn&#x27;t come on, so I just returned it.</li>
            <li> Wish I spent more and got something better quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works but the light is very bright on off button. So I can&#x27;t use it at night because it glows very bright.  the had you put the oil on I&#x27;m not a big fan of either.</li>
            <li> Works great, love how small it is!</li>
            <li> Cute little item, does the trick.  Very quiet and works with batteries as well as the usb cord</li>
            <li> Strictly a travel diffuser, which was reason it was bought.  Only airs in small area,</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my work office and it works wonderfully! I love how you can plug it in with the USB cord or, use the battery. My whole office smells great and it is quiet as can be. Great gift idea for essential oil lovers.</li>
            <li> Love this it works really well in my car.  I diffused my peppermint oil, and my car smelled amazing.  What I love is the smells are all natural and not  flowery and chemical ridden!!! Great item!!</li>
            <li> Bought one for home and one for my office.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Love this product. The only thing that I have to say u want aware of was I thought it was an actual ultrasonic diffuser since it used the term mist. I&#x27;m thinking that is my fault though by not reading the description clearly. Either way, it works great and I would encourage anyone who needs a small diffuser to get this. Great price and size. It is great for my office and I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments on it.</li>
            <li> My first one made some noise after about 4 weeks.  I contacted the company and they sent out a new one right away.  LOVE IT as it sites quietly on my desk at work!  Love the portability factor!  Will probably buy another just to leave in my suitcase for travel!</li>
            <li> Took this on vacation and it worked great!</li>
            <li> Uses battery and USB to power pod. Excellent product</li>
            <li> GREAT LITTLE DIFFUSER.</li>
            <li> Piece of Crap. Broke within one week. Horrible and very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser. Its small, compact and easy to use. It fits in your palm and isn&#x27;t an eyesore at all. It runs off batteries or you can plug it in with ease if it will be stationary for a while. The cord is long enough that it can placed on top of a dresser while plugged in, and not too long so that you will trip over it. It creates a great fragrance that is not overpowering. I do wish that it had an adjustment knob but I&#x27;ll take it as is for the price! The fan is quiet and not distracting at all.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for my desk</li>
            <li> A GREAT alternative way to enjoy my essential oils. The water diffusers are wonderful, but expensive and mine seem to burn out pretty quickly. This item uses large scent pads (comes with several) that you drop your oil on and enjoy. Also comes with power adapter which was a big plus!</li>
            <li> Did not perform as described</li>
            <li> I like this little defusser, but the second time I used it it was really noisy.</li>
            <li> This little diffuser is very powerful! It really takes care of a large room! It is quiet, and I like how no water is needed .  So it is a very clean and easy diffuser to use.</li>
            <li> Very good buy, powers right by my laptop/computer.</li>
            <li> Great little product to keep a room smelling good and fresh.  I use it in my office and love it.  My only complaint is it would be nice to have a regular power cord</li>
            <li> I had the the diffuser for a few days and then it broke.  I emailed GreenAir Company and within a 1 week they gave me another one.  I have had it for a couple of days and it&#x27;s working nicely.The size is perfect for my office space!</li>
            <li> Works great and small enough to be out of my way I love it</li>
            <li> What a great product.  Batteries seem to last a long time.  Almost no sound, I have to get really close to hear it.  I used one of the original pads to draw an outline and cut out for more pads from a sheet of felt I purchased at a craft store.  Well made, compact, easy to change pads for different oils.  I got this on sale, and now see it is on sale again.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot on a diffuser. But I really wanted to give diffusing incense oils a try. Since so many of these are $30, $40 and so much more, I didn&#x27;t hold out much hope for a good quality product. I&#x27;m so glad I gave this a try. I was mostly afraid it would be noisy and sporadic. It is neither. It runs quietly and is perfect for setting on my night table to diffuse my oils without inundating the whole house. It&#x27;s a nice diffuser and works quietly and efficiently. More than worth the small price.</li>
            <li> Love this little diffuser!  It&#x27;s great for small spaces and needs no water. It comes with 3 felt pads to drop the oil on.  It has a battery operated fan inside that blows the fragrance from the felt pad.  I don&#x27;t believe there are any therapeutic benefits to this type of diffuser.  It&#x27;s pretty much fragrance only.  You&#x27;ll need 2 AA batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I purchased this in August of 2015.  The last 5 months it&#x27;s been making noise like something is loose inside although I can&#x27;t find anything.  If you want something that will run quietly you may want to rethink this.  I know it wasn&#x27;t a lot of money, but I would expect it to last longer than  a couple of months without a problem.</li>
            <li> Nice little scent maker.  I probably misread the description but this product doesn&#x27;t use water, so there is no vapors. But, it does put the smell out in the room very well</li>
            <li> Just got it,  very impressed.  You can&#x27;t have champagne expectations on a beer budget,  but for $11, I&#x27;m very happy so far. I just got it today.  It is ultra and seems to disperse the scent quite well.</li>
            <li> Product works great and it got to me quickly!</li>
            <li> Love it...Small but will spread the scent through two rooms (living room &amp; bathroom) within 3 mins..</li>
            <li> I worked well and was quiet when I first received it.  But, after I changed the filter to put in a different oil it started making noise. Now it is so noisy, I don&#x27;t even use it.</li>
            <li> I ordered these thinking they would be a good addition to the scentbug that I already had as they run on usb power, but they really dont seem to have the power that the scentbug has. They are okay but you really need to keep them very close to you to be able to smell your essential oils. I haven&#x27;t tried it in a small confined area like a car yet  but I am hoping it might be better in a smaller area ?</li>
            <li> Great price and works wonderful for diffusing oil!</li>
            <li> I bought two of these - one for my office and another for my bedroom. I enjoy them both. They&#x27;re very easy to use. It takes less than 60 seconds to  add oil to the pad and turn it on. I keep mine plugged into my laptop to scent my office. The only reason it&#x27;s not 5 stars is that it was described as having the ability to &amp;#34;mist&amp;#34; - which is inaccurate - because it uses no water.</li>
            <li> Not what I excepted its can of cheap and will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it 4 stars simply because I&#x27;m a little nervous about the plastic tabs that hold the covers in place, but I&#x27;ve used it carefully several times for a few weeks now and so far, so good!  I love plugging it into my computer and having a waft of scent right next to me at my desk.  Super easy to use, discreet design and quiet.  Great little gizmo for $10!</li>
            <li> This is OK, it does not give out any mist, so the aroma was much stronger. May be good for a larger area but for my office, the scent is a little over bearing to handle, for me!</li>
            <li> covers a very small area but better than nothing when traveling.  Use it in Motel room by my bed.</li>
            <li> We absolutely love these little diffusers.  So handy.</li>
            <li> Such a small item, but really powerful.  It makes a great air freshener !</li>
            <li> works but not for very long, feel like I am wasting my oil. get one that diffuses with water, nice travel piece though.</li>
            <li> Very cool item,  no need to add water! Purchased as teachers gift. She loves it!</li>
            <li> Great little diffuser, exceptionally quiet.  No water needed so great for car, office, travel.  Only complaint was the delivery box was not properly sealed, shipping list missing and possibly a diffuser or two.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Works fine but not as good as a more expensive diffuser mist.</li>
            <li> Great item! Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Use it every day. I only need to know where to purchase refill disc.</li>
            <li> This is really neat- good air diffusion with the fan, quiet, bright blue light helps you see it and remember if you need to turn it off.  The scent doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as a candle type diffuser, but that&#x27;s ok, that could be the essential oils I used.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:5e261b415209a0079a841e99744f8ba1]] This cute little oil diffuser has a convenient USB plug-in option, which is why I bought it for my office, but it rattles. It sounds like the fan is hitting something, and based on many reviews, I think this is unusual. Perhaps it was jarred during shipping. I am returning it. I&#x27;ll try to upload a video.</li>
            <li> Have it in the basement where my pets live and it has made a big difference. It&#x27;s not a strong scent but good enough to turn the basement into a spa. Helps my nose and calms the pets. I use felt fabric by tracing the padding so I have plenty of refill pads. I only use it for 15 mins at the most to help the ordor and turn it off when I leave for work.&lt;br /&gt;What I like about this too, you can plug in any room at the most decrete place. Like most candle burning aromatherapy, you worry about refilling the water or replacing the tea candle before it dries out or burns out. I like the fact you can plug it in the car. It&#x27;s small but gives enough scent for just 5 drops. Not expensive too.</li>
            <li> Just the right size! Easy!</li>
            <li> Stay away from this item.  The first one did not work at all.  The company gave me my money back. I bought another one and it literally burned up in two days</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> It stopped working after a month. The little blue light still comes on when you push the power button, but the fan no longer turns. I have it plugged in with the power cord, not just on battery power. Of course this happens about 3 days past the return expiration date. Not very pleased with this little thing anymore.</li>
            <li> Works nicely but a little hard to open up</li>
            <li> I Like them, I just had to wait for my oils to arrive, they came now I can try them out I bought two one for the Living room the other in the bathroom.  Friday&#x3D;3/27/15  7:07pm</li>
            <li> I love this little thing! I bought this for my toddlers bedroom (13 x 9) and it does a fantastic job of diffusing the scent throughout his room.</li>
            <li> THE DIFFUSER WAS PACKAGED WELL AND ARRIVED IN GOOD CONDITION,  SO FAR IT HAS WORKED GREAT AND I PLAN TO PURCHASE ANOTHER UNIT. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT HIGHLY.</li>
            <li> I use this diffuser at work.  I notice that the scent does not last as long, and the fan inside would sometimes spin slow at times.  I couldn&#x27;t use an oil diffuser in my cubicle, so when I found this, I thought I would be a great alternative.  I use more essential oil on this than the regular oil diffuser.  So, I am not using it quite as much anymore.</li>
            <li> Works good for now with batteries. Just wish it plugged into a regular outlet instead of my computer.</li>
            <li> I use this for doTERRA essential oils. I couldn&#x27;t justify the cost of the doTERRA diffusers.</li>
            <li> Nice compact unit.  Works ok but no real instructions so I don&#x27;t know if I can buy replacement pieces (the felt piece you put your essential oil on).  It does work but wish it were a bigger unit.  I put it on nightstand (bedside) and run it w/ lavendar essential oil... love that!</li>
            <li> This is by FAR the neatest little machine. I love it. Right out of the box had it working in less than 5 minutes. Super simple setup &amp; replacements. One thing I suggest is you can use little cotton pads cut in the same shape without getting the replacements! Or even felt. 😊 I use the recommended amount of oil 4-5 drops &amp; the output is unbelievable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I have this little guy right next to my bed on my nightstand. But, it filled the whole room. I was skeptical at first because I never heard anything. So I made sure it was actually working. Lol. That&#x27;s how quiet it is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only warning, the blue light on the little button is crazy bright in the dark. Pretty. But bright. I ended up cutting a small piece of black paper &amp; taping it to the button. Definitely recommended, I even got my sister to buy 1!! I&#x27;m going to purchase another for my daughter&#x27;s room &amp; even my parents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: 6/18/15: I had to return my little machine, so bummed out that the motor started rattling loudly. The fan was whisper quiet for the first two uses, but by the third it rattled really loudly. 😞 wish I could&#x27;ve kept it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 6/29/15: This company is by far 1 of the BEST I&#x27;ve ever ordered from. After I let them know the product was defective, they immediately sent me out a replacement free of charge. The new 1 seems to be working just fine, I&#x27;ve used it over 3x now and it&#x27;s still as quiet as before. Definitely recommend this company as well as this little machine. It&#x27;s GREAT! 😊</li>
            <li> This item is complete and total junk. I am truly surprised that Amazon is affiliated with sellers that produce such an inferior product. One star is being extremely generous.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like it really gets the scent out into the air, it&#x27;s okay, I just thought it might blow the scent further.</li>
            <li> It is so noisy when plugged into AC power that I can&#x27;t sleep and the reason I bought this unit was to dispense the scent of my sleepy time essential oils to help me sleep.  Would not recommend. I&#x27;m now on my second unit and it at least worked for a couple of weeks before the noise started.  I really wanted this to work because when it was quiet, it did what it was supposed to do, help my sleep.  But when it rattles louder than a Mack truck, how can anyone sleep!!!</li>
            <li> Love it, use it everyday in my office.</li>
            <li> I got this for diffusing in the car and it works very well. It fits well on the console and the fan is strong enough to fill my midsize car. Each pad can be used repeatedly until it will no longer absorb oil.</li>
            <li> Very Happy with the Diffuser! Love it and would suggest it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Did not perform to my satisfaction</li>
            <li> Not worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> So far this little thing does a big job. I have placed it in our bathroom at work. 15+ woman using 2 stalls, well you can imagine. Plus no outlet for the adapter so I have to use 2 AA batteries. The batteries are lasting about a week and a half and that is running 24/7. I put peppermint oil on it every morning, around 7 drops. No more having to use spray air freshener. When you walk in its not overpowering peppermint but there is also not the cloud of toxic smells we all can produce from time to time lol</li>
            <li> Okay, it would get 5 stars, but I just got this an hour ago, and although it&#x27;s working wonderfully I&#x27;m not sure yet how dependable it will be. It&#x27;s on my end table next to me while I do homework. I got this for my mental focus EO to hopefully help me concentrate while doing homework. It&#x27;s definitely not going to travel across rooms or anything, but as long as your within 5 ft it puts out a decent stream. It would be great for a car, bathroom, nightstand right beside your bed, or on your end table like I&#x27;m doing. Don&#x27;t expect it to work like the $30-100 ones! If your looking for a humidifier diffuser this is not it. If you want a little aromatherapy right beside you, or in a smaller rooms, it&#x27;s perfect! Would buy again as long as it proves to be dependable. Hopefully it works for a year or so. If it does I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the money! Also, if you need a stronger smell, put more drops of your EOs on the scent pad. I only used the recommended 5 drops.</li>
            <li> I love it! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with my Greenair Scent Pod Oil Diffuser.  I use only my Youngevity Essential Oils in it and specifically enjoy our Peppermint and change off to our Spearmint for a clean wonderful aroma.</li>
            <li> I like the diffuser, but after a couple of times, it no longer closes.  However, for the price, I am pleased.</li>
            <li> By far the best travel diffuser I have and great for the price. Some of these run so expensive and this was a great buy</li>
            <li> I work in an office where we&#x27;re all crammed into cubes.  It&#x27;s depressing.  I go hours without seeing daylight.  A colleague of mine had bought something similar, and I enjoyed the fragrance.  It made her office seem at least a touch spa-like.  She paid a mint for hers, and it looks almost identical to this one.  This is perfect for smaller desk areas, and plugs up easily to your USB port (and I&#x27;m a total techno-phobe).  I ordered a variety of oils to use in it, and have been pleased with them all.  This diffuser is great at providing a nice subtle stream of scent.  My only complaint is that it is not as quiet as I would like.  However, given the rude people around me who enjoy making incessant personal calls and cutting their fingernails at their desk, frankly I don&#x27;t care.  I would purchase this again if mine breaks.  It would make a nice gift for a colleague.</li>
            <li> The greenair scent pod was exactly as expected! It&#x27;s small enough for my work space where I use a mix of lemon, peppermint, basil, rosemary &amp; grapefruit oil to infuse! I&#x27;ve taking it in the car and plugged in as a usb for long car rides too.</li>
            <li> Works and it&#x27;s cheap. Don&#x27;t drop it though or the fan will rattle pretty bad. I plugged it into my PC and my foot caught the cord. It survived but it&#x27;s noisier now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this diffuser.  I save the used pads and switch them in and out as I use different blends.  This is easy to travel with and quiet.</li>
            <li> I use this in my office at work and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> The item was smaller than I thought it would be. You must use batteries or plug the device into a usb drive to make it run. I used batteries my first day &amp; they died within a couple hours. The machine won&#x27;t fill 1 small room with the sents</li>
            <li> Hard to smell the oils</li>
            <li> This thing just fell apart. It&#x27;s like throwing money down the drain.</li>
            <li> received in timely manner. love turning it on at my desk while working...connected to the computer or using the battery. Thank you</li>
            <li> I have this on my desk at work and the fan is very loud and distracting. I have a decent sized office and I can hear the fan in the hallway.</li>
            <li> This little cutie pie comes with me to work and I use lemongrass and rosemary essential oils as a quick pick-me-up! Sometimes if I don&#x27;t close it properly the fan makes a little grating noise, but then I adjust and it goes on silently wafting aromatherapy in my direction.</li>
            <li> My room smell so good love this gadget easy to use cheap to opperate</li>
            <li> Not bad. I don&#x27;t know if this actually qualifies as a diffuser, there&#x27;s a fan that blows out the smell of the oil that is soaked into a pad. It spreads the fragrance nicely.</li>
            <li> Great little diffuser, until it isn&#x27;t. I have had this diffuser for a couple months. It has been used daily, but never dropped or misused. It has started making such a huge rattling noise that I can&#x27;t use it at my desk anymore because it disturbs me and everyone around me. Disappointed because it filled my classroom with aroma.</li>
            <li> Ive never owned one of these type devices so I really didnt know what to expect. It&#x27;s such a small thing about the size of a computer mouse but is amazing in how it works. I plugged it into my computer after adding a few drops of my essential oil to the felt pad inside and I immediately could smell the aroma. It does not produce a mist,there is a small fan inside that allows the oils to be stirred up and released into the air. I love that you can use batteries if you want to move it around or take it in your car even. I&#x27;m glad this was my first purchase of a diffuser, it has been a great experience.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very compact &amp; works well after first adding drops. Doesn&#x27;t last long though before having to add drops again.&lt;br /&gt;Was very quiet at first but at times the little fan can make noise.</li>
            <li> I have this on my desk at work.  It scents up my space pretty good with out much noise.  I like that I can just plug it in to my computer with the included usb cord.  The on /off button stopped working the first week but it is stuck on on so I just unplug it to turn it off and plug it back in to turn it on.</li>
            <li> This product hardly diffuses oils at all.  Even in my small office I can only smell the oil for a few minutes before it stops working well.  I would not purchase this product!</li>
            <li> Not happy with this at all I tecieved this today and it&#x27;s so tiny, it doesn&#x27;t even come with a plug in idk what they want you to plug this in to! But I guess u get what u pay for!</li>
