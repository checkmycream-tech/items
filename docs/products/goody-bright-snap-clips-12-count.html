            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with these clips they are very strong and hold hair real well</li>
            <li>Great price and great little clips!</li>
            <li>They are easy to misplace, but I don&#x27;t mind since they are inexpensive.</li>
            <li>but for those of us not blessed with good hair, I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>These work just fine.</li>
            <li>These work well for fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I plan on buying more as they are quickly disappearing around here.</li>
            <li>I could use them to secure fly-aways in a pony tail, but that&#x27;s it.  </li>
            <li>My girls hair is very fine, so these slip and don&#x27;t stay in place very well.</li>
            <li>I liked these basic metal barrettes because they match so many outfits...</li>
            <li>They hold the hair up good and I only need to use one or two!</li>
            <li>Great little snaps.</li>
            <li>and these are amazing for twisting her hair and clipping back.</li>
            <li>They just fall right out.  </li>
            <li>Love them, exactly what I was expecting for my 2 year old girl, she likes.</li>
            <li>Cute, fun to wear, and come in several colors.  </li>
            <li>Works well on my three year old daughter&#x27;s fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have short hair and needed some clips to hold it off my face during exercise that were bright enough that I didn&#x27;t lose them.  </li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t too large for her</li>
            <li>The colors in the set of clip are great, but the quality if poor.  </li>
            <li>and they seem to hold really well.</li>
            <li>I have short hair, so these are great for the short hairs that pop out of my tiny pony tail.</li>
            <li>I am an adult and use them on the side of my head right over ears to pull hair away from ears.  </li>
            <li>The clip quality is good, but they are a bit small for my needs for my 2 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>Love the way they snap, they hold her thick hair very well!!</li>
            <li>Slight problem is that they keep getting lost as they are easy for kids to pull off.</li>
            <li>I was gladly surprised because they grip better than other bigger ones I tried.</li>
            <li>Comfortable wear for little ones.</li>
            <li>Bought for my 14 month old.</li>
            <li>I got these for my 15 month old</li>
            <li>I think most adults hair would be too thick for these</li>
            <li>These are typical hair clips, true to the goody brand quality standards.  </li>
            <li>I believe these might be just fine for a small child.  </li>
            <li>Clips are smaller than normal size clips.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected to get.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine, thin hair and clips that way too much tend to slip out of my hair.</li>
            <li>These are good for clipping a few whisps of hair in the toddler but not good for elementary age active child.</li>

            <li> Not too large and not too small. .</li>
            <li> As long as they hold my hair well</li>
            <li> For an adult they&#x27;re a bit too small.  </li>

            <li> My 3 year old has thick curly hair.  These clips aren&#x27;t  big enough to hold her hair away from her face.
