            <li>Its got a wonderful scent, and is as gentle on skin and eyes as baby shampoo.</li>
            <li>Does a nice job of taking the chlorine stink put of my kid.</li>
            <li>It smells relly good, like coconut but not to an overwhelming degree.</li>
            <li>My kids liked the scent and the creamy texture of the shampoo.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my two young girls.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and even use it on myself,</li>
            <li>This product helped a great deal in detangling their hair and I am able to comb it out much easier when the bath is over.</li>
            <li>My sons, 4 and 7, liked his shampoo and it gets them clean...pretty much filled my expectations.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s not start over thinking baby shampoo. :)</li>
            <li>Gets their hair clean without stripping it, leaves it soft and easy to brush, smells awesome and doesn&#x27;t gunk up their hair.</li>
            <li>and it works well to clean their hair and help keep it detangled and shiny!</li>
            <li>I like this scent because it&#x27;s fun for kids and not gender specific, so both the girls and the boys in our house are happy!</li>
            <li>My two girls (the younger ones) have extremely fine hair that is always getting tangled (mostly from food) but this works great</li>
            <li>Tear free is a joke.</li>
            <li>This is some great stuff - I use it on my 5yr old, 3yr old, and 1yr old and it works amazing on all their hair!  </li>
            <li>This and the conditioner are great for slipping into the swim bag.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ironic that we have better results and faith in this product.  </li>
            <li>After trying this I was surprised to that it is a pretty good quality conditioner.</li>
            <li>Overall, I’m very satisfied with the product</li>
            <li>My 5 year old is able to clean himself with no worries about burning eyes.  </li>
            <li>Very soft and smells lovely.  </li>
            <li>THe pink is a close second, but they all are awesome shampoos.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t have to face the madness of Walmart, so it was worth it.</li>
            <li>So, it was great getting 6 of his favorite scent, Cowabunga Coconut, for the same price as the other six pack that they sell in stores.</li>
            <li>With this her hair feels clean and it’s reasonable to brush through.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very rich and thick and I  also love the smell!</li>
            <li>My favorite of the smoothers is the blue bottle</li>
            <li>My daughter picks up this specific 2-in-1 every time we run out and go get more.</li>
            <li>It seems like with most dual purpose ones her hair either didn’t feel clean or it was a mess</li>
            <li>I pretty much like all the Suave products for kids.</li>
            <li>The 6 pack price on amazon is much better than the individual price per bottle in the store, not to mention the free shipping!&lt;br /&gt;Smell is not overpowering like so many other scented shampoos are, and the 2 in 1 helps make bathtime quicker, even with long hair!  </li>
            <li>The shampoo/conditioner combo works very well</li>
            <li>They are reasonably priced for what they are and do the job they are meant to do.</li>
            <li>So far this product has left it the most conditioned.</li>
            <li>My 16 month old son has wavy blonde hair- fine but lots of it.  </li>
            <li>One has fine straight hair, the other has curly hair.</li>
            <li>THe Blue and Pink do seems do soften hair a bit more.</li>
            <li>This beats even Walmart&#x27;s prices and it is the exact same brand and quality.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind so much when it does double duty on the dolls.</li>
            <li>she is 9 years old now but still asks me to buy this shampoo for her.</li>
            <li>No trouble with the shampoo getting in his eyes or anything.  </li>
            <li>This has become a favorite in our house over the last few years.</li>
            <li>Two of my kids (the girls) have long hair, and this seems to work great at the &#x27;smoothing&#x27; end, though we do use a separate extra conditioner too, just because their hair is SO long and thick.</li>
            <li>I paid pretty much what I would have paid in the store, so no great savings, but it was delivered to my door</li>

            <li> This beats even Walmart&#x27;s prices and it is the exact same brand and quality. My 5 year old is able to clean himself with no worries about burning eyes.  Highly recommend for little ones!</li>
            <li> This is some great stuff - I use it on my 5yr old, 3yr old, and 1yr old and it works amazing on all their hair!  My two girls (the younger ones) have extremely fine hair that is always getting tangled (mostly from food) but this works great - I don&#x27;t even have to use detangler anymore.  And the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my two young girls. One has fine straight hair, the other has curly hair. I have tried many other kid&#x27;s products, including expensive boutique brands and they all leave them with tangles or a filmy finish in their hair. This stuff works great. Gets their hair clean without stripping it, leaves it soft and easy to brush, smells awesome and doesn&#x27;t gunk up their hair. And the price?? Can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> Great buy! Local store was more expensive for single bottles. They don&#x27;t have this scent either. Leaves my daughters curly hair hydrated. Wish the scent was a bit stronger because it&#x27;s Sooo Good, but it is for kids. That&#x27;s why 4 instead of 5.</li>
            <li> We have been using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and even use it on myself, My favorite of the smoothers is the blue bottle but I cannot ever find them anywhere. THe pink is a close second, but they all are awesome shampoos. THe Blue and Pink do seems do soften hair a bit more.</li>
            <li> After trying this I was surprised to that it is a pretty good quality conditioner. It&#x27;s very rich and thick and I  also love the smell! Coconut is one of my fave scents.</li>
            <li> We have been buying this at the store until our local stores stopped carrying it.  The 6 pack price on amazon is much better than the individual price per bottle in the store, not to mention the free shipping!&lt;br /&gt;Smell is not overpowering like so many other scented shampoos are, and the 2 in 1 helps make bathtime quicker, even with long hair!  My kids like it and it works well to clean their hair and help keep it detangled and shiny!</li>
            <li> This has become a favorite in our house over the last few years. My daughter picks up this specific 2-in-1 every time we run out and go get more. She loves the smell (it does smell quite yummy) and she’s happy that she doesn’t have to worry about stinging in her eyes. The shampoo/conditioner combo works very well considering it’s a 2-in-1. It seems like with most dual purpose ones her hair either didn’t feel clean or it was a mess the brush through. With this her hair feels clean and it’s reasonable to brush through. We use a spray in conditioner after showering to make it easier to brush. Overall, I’m very satisfied with the product and we plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li> Ive used this shampoo on all 4 of my kids! Its got a wonderful scent, and is as gentle on skin and eyes as baby shampoo.</li>
            <li> Tear free is a joke. My 2 yr old got a little in her eye while getting her hair washed and she cried her eyes out, kept rubbing it and kept saying \\&quot;eye, eye\\&quot;. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying suave products anymore.</li>
            <li> Great price firs wave kids stuff. I don&#x27;t mind so much when it does double duty on the dolls. Perfect to slip into the swim bag for showering after the pool. Does a nice job of taking the chlorine stink put of my kid. I use it as body wash as well at the pool. This and the conditioner are great for slipping into the swim bag.</li>
            <li> I like this scent because it&#x27;s fun for kids and not gender specific, so both the girls and the boys in our house are happy!</li>
            <li> My grandson hates water in his eyes and this 2 in 1 makes it so I only have to rinse his hair once. Also it doesn&#x27;t hurt his eyes which is great too.</li>
            <li> I pretty much like all the Suave products for kids. They are reasonably priced for what they are and do the job they are meant to do. This shampoo is as described and has a great scent. I paid pretty much what I would have paid in the store, so no great savings, but it was delivered to my door and I didn&#x27;t have to face the madness of Walmart, so it was worth it. Two of my kids (the girls) have long hair, and this seems to work great at the &#x27;smoothing&#x27; end, though we do use a separate extra conditioner too, just because their hair is SO long and thick.</li>
            <li> I have two little girls with long hair, and tangles are serious business for us. I decided to try the 2 in 1 product because washing their hair is always a battle and when I have to do a separate conditioning it&#x27;s not worth the battle. This product helped a great deal in detangling their hair and I am able to comb it out much easier when the bath is over. It smells relly good, like coconut but not to an overwhelming degree.</li>
            <li> This is a great shop and save item. Cheaper than in the store. My kids liked the scent and the creamy texture of the shampoo.</li>
            <li> In case any of you were wondering, or a little unclear, as I was, let me clarify that all 6 bottles are Cowabunga Coconut!  This is a great value! In stores, I cannot find this scent by itself.  It comes with 5 other scented shampoos, two of which my son doesn&#x27;t like.  So, it was great getting 6 of his favorite scent, Cowabunga Coconut, for the same price as the other six pack that they sell in stores.</li>
            <li> this is one of the only shampoos that gets my daughter&#x27;s frizzy hair under control! she is 9 years old now but still asks me to buy this shampoo for her. it even works better than some of the very expensive adult hair shampoos for her, but costs much less. and it smells great!</li>
            <li> My sons, 4 and 7, liked his shampoo and it gets them clean...pretty much filled my expectations. They like the coconut scent.</li>
            <li> We had used an Avon coconut shampoo before.  Also tried the aveeno baby.  My 16 month old son has wavy blonde hair- fine but lots of it.  So far this product has left it the most conditioned. Very soft and smells lovely.  We love our baby smelling like a tropical fruit! No trouble with the shampoo getting in his eyes or anything.  My mother in law tried some expensive, organic stuff that left him screaming and eyes burning- it&#x27;s ironic that we have better results and faith in this product.  Let&#x27;s not start over thinking baby shampoo. :)</li>
