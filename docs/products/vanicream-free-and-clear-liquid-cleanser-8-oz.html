            <li>For all of us who have sensitivities and allergies to soaps and fragrances, good news.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended I use this cleanser, along with a retinoid and a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>So all in all a good body wash esp people with sensitivities.</li>
            <li>Good chemical-free body wash.</li>
            <li>I had been using a scented liquid cleanser that I loved and had to give it up.</li>
            <li>The shampoo version not so good (dries out my hair and scalp).</li>
            <li>I have to use alot of it to have lather, so I dont know how good it is yet.  </li>
            <li>and I find it to be an exceptionally good product.  </li>
            <li>All in all, a good cleanser for a really good price.</li>
            <li>The product inside the bottle is good.</li>

            <li>It is unscented, has a good lather, and it cleans well, including removing most of my eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>Did nothing to soothe the outbreak on my face but was effective for oily skin to combat the humidity of the DC summer.</li>

            <li>Suds up nicely.  </li>

            <li>Cleanses nicely and washes away without leaving any film on my face.</li>
            <li>Reall nice, lots of suds, doesn&#x27;t seem to strip skin though</li>
            <li>foams up nicely, rinses nicely, cleans nicely.</li>

            <li>she has been using this for a while and finds that it is the best wash that she has used so far.</li>
            <li>but if you have sensitive girly area&#x27;s this is THEE best thing i have ever used.</li>
            <li>This is by far the BEST face cleanser I have found.</li>
            <li>This said it&#x27;s suitable for &amp;</li>
            <li>I bought one for my bathroom sink and one for the kitchen sink, and will probably add it to my shower too if I can&#x27;t find a suitable body wash.</li>

            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>My favorite face wash..</li>
            <li>so glad I got it</li>
            <li>This cleanser can even be used for babies and is recommended by many pediatricians and dermatologists.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is so wonderful and simple.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>If you like Vanicream products you will love this.</li>
            <li>I bought for my daughter with allergies to use and she hasn&#x27;t seemed to have any troubles although her skin hasn&#x27;t gotten any better</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>So now I am always sure to just use it by the sink.</li>
            <li>All are great products and I am really grateful for the lack of perfumes, masking fragrances, and unneeded botanical ingredients that could cause allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love love love this soap for my excema-sensitive babies.  </li>
            <li>I searched for a soap that would help with my daughters eczema and didn&#x27;t have anything that could irritate her skin allergies more.</li>
            <li>I find many Health Food Products contain too many herb and flower extracts.</li>
            <li>If you like it be sure to look at the 32 oz refill</li>
            <li>:)  </li>

            <li>Love this stuff.</li>

            <li>I am very happy with how this product left my skin and did not cause any reactions/redness.  </li>
            <li>I love this cleanser for my face.</li>
            <li>For this price I&#x27;d expect a lot more.</li>
            <li>For anyone suffering with Eczema or Atopic Eczema this product&lt;br /&gt;is the most &amp;#34;FREE AND CLEAR&amp;#34; that I have been able to locate.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this item for more than a year</li>
            <li>My skin is getting better and better.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not awful either</li>
            <li>I am allergic to most shampoos and cleansers as they contain detergent like chemicals, as in sulfates.  </li>
            <li>I love love the ointment, cream and &amp;#34;lite&amp;#34; lotion.  </li>
            <li>Can I say, I absolutely love this soap.  </li>
            <li>, if it was more moisturizing I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser.</li>
            <li>After use it leaves your face clean feeling, not squeaky clean like some bars of soap, but a real nice clean.</li>
            <li>Affordable, light and does the trick... Cleans my face &amp; controls breakouts!</li>
            <li>(nothing is :) ).</li>
            <li>Nice lather, washes off clean.</li>
            <li>Will continue to buy from Amazon as long as they keep offering the best prices!</li>
            <li>It cleans my face perfectly without leaving it dry</li>
            <li>Works great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>This is a great face wash for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>have bought this same brand&#x27;s SPF 50, and that seems to be very good.</li>
            <li>Like the shampoo and conditioner made by this company, this is a great soap for the chemically sensitive person.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This is a great soap for sensitive hands.</li>
            <li>Great for people with eczema or sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Great face/hand/body wash for those of us with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for babies or kids with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Great product for overly sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and does not react kindly to cleansers of any kind.</li>
            <li>use other Vanicream products too - wonderful line.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product without all the junk in other soaps.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like Cetaphil in mildness but seems to clean better as I dont have eczema on my forehead.</li>
            <li>Free and Clear is a great product that I have been using for over two years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that easy to find</li>
            <li>Lather occurs more frequently when a product is alkaline, which is not as good for skin.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use much, it gives a good lather, and rinses clean.  </li>
            <li>My teenager uses free and clear for cleansing her face, works great for her skin, keeps it clean from breaking out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just fine and priced well.  </li>
            <li>The cleanser isn&#x27;t really that strong, which i kinda liked (i thought i wouldn&#x27;t)...</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, cleared up breakouts I had been experiencing,  super gentle and effective at removing all my makeup.</li>
            <li>I would not expect that to have something scent and dye free</li>
            <li>Whenever I have people over, someone always comes out of the bathroom raving about this soap, and I even find that a diluted solution of about 1 to 1 suits my purposes (light living, not a motor rebuilding hobbyist).</li>
            <li>IT doesn&#x27;t say tear free but never seems to bother them when it gets in their eyes.</li>
            <li>In two days I was rash free and remain after months of use.</li>
            <li>Frangrance free too.</li>
            <li>It washes well, there&#x27;s no offensive scent and it leaves the skin smooth.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t ever put great smells above your health.</li>
            <li>and I like to use products that are alcohol, parfum, dyes and etc free.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind the scent too much, even though it is unscented.&lt;br /&gt;Not a scent of flowers or fruits, but a kind of masking odor which I do not like.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The liquid is so light it feels almost like water on your skin.</li>
            <li>We chose this product because it is formaldehyde and scent free -- that says it all for us.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a handy ready to use anywhere dispenser</li>
            <li>I appreciate that it is fragrance and sulfate free</li>
            <li>We are still enjoying this cleanser, &amp; it&#x27;s worth a repurchase for me, but it&#x27;s no miracle</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, this is superior to Phisoderm.  </li>
            <li>I have heard from others that they found this to be too drying for their skin, in which case I would recommend using along with Complex15 facial creme (which is now best ordered overseas or from eBay as it is no longer available at a reasonable price here in the states.  </li>
            <li>So far so good....</li>
            <li>This product foams and cleanses very nicely without causing me to have red, blotchy reactions to its ingredients.</li>
            <li>but it does clean well and does not leave a film.</li>
            <li>There is no scent and it will leave you clean without ruining your skin.</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean after use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does clean well, though.</li>
            <li>Gets them clean without breaking them out.</li>
            <li>I use it to preserve the health of my skin and to clean the brushes I use to do art work while avoiding the accidental introduction of impurities into my art work after cleaning brushes.</li>
            <li>, just CLEAN.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this so far</li>
            <li>I always use this product after I clean my make up with a makeup remover.</li>
            <li>Nothing special, I think any body wash would do what this did.</li>
            <li>I have used this brand&#x27;s hair gel for my infant (you hear that right!)</li>
            <li>Truth be told, I would have liked a little bit more of a moisturized feel, but it&#x27;s ok just as it</li>
            <li>This product, however, i feel is a good middle ground.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have much more to say about it.  </li>
            <li>This soap is full of chemicals.</li>
            <li>Love that it is refillable at a fairly reasonable price.</li>
            <li>For those with oily/ sensitive skin I have a pretty good</li>
            <li>My daughters have extreme eczema and this works great for them...</li>
            <li>Mild and non-allergenic.  </li>
            <li>now I can only save more money but also get better skin.</li>
            <li>I also find that it does a very good job of removing my make up (although I don&#x27;t usually wear a lot).  </li>
            <li>I have normal skin and just love it.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is a good value, works well, doesn&#x27;t dry out their skin and has caused no irritation.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s gentle, doesn&#x27;t sting, and suds up easily.</li>
            <li>The Free &amp; Clear is very silky and seems to clean even better than the Cetaphil I was using.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>Free and Clear works great, cleans and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li>--it is a great cleanser for anyone who has any sensitivities, be they to harsh chemicals or to overpowering scents.</li>
            <li>I am happy to say that he hasn&#x27;t had a flare up since a few days after we started using this.  </li>
            <li>After all these years of Elephant man face, I&#x27;m back to my own</li>
            <li>great for sensitive skin and use before topical treatments and vanicream.</li>
            <li>this is a great option for kids who have sensitive skin, especially on their hands.</li>
            <li>This product is great for sensitive facial skin.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t argue with the sensitivity issues, which more people may need than I did (I just naturally prefer fewer chemicals).</li>
            <li>Still, I would hope for more lathering and cleaning action from even a generous amount of product.</li>
            <li>are worth the price.</li>
            <li>an honest, simple clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It has a nice lather, semi-low lathering but still enough to satisfy the senses and feels silky in the hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the $$-</li>
            <li>We are also dealing with the occasional pimple, &amp; I am pleased to say that this cleaner is uniquely cleansing yet moisturizing without leaving a residue,</li>
            <li>This may be good for other people but not for me.</li>
            <li>Right now I am also using for wash at night is Neutrogena&#x27;s Naturals with willowbark.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super gentle for the most sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s more than your average hand soap but his comfort and healthy skin</li>
            <li>I thought I needed a daily scrub to get everything clean, but this very gentle cleanser does that for me and does it way better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have not used a cleanser that is more gentle.</li>
            <li>Cheapest price is on Amazon and there is a large refill too!</li>
            <li>It lathers nice and doesn&#x27;t dry out his hands.</li>
            <li>I have very very SUPER sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I cannot use any other it is so easy to use and makes my  face feel clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and it doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling tight after washing, so it has been a good cleanser to use.</li>
            <li>This is very gentle and haven&#x27;t had this problem with this product.  </li>
            <li>It has no smell, but cleans very gently.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle.</li>
            <li>This stuff really seems to work!  </li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>I will definately purchase again when my first bottle runs out.</li>
            <li>My daughter has many allergies and will get red rashes and hives from some cleansers.  </li>
            <li>Free and Clear of anything from nature.</li>
            <li>We ditched this, but still use the Vanicream bar soap and Free and Clear Shampoo.</li>
            <li>Our granddaughter has eczema and this is the first cleanser that doesn&#x27;t burn her skin.  </li>
            <li>Steam face with a hot washcloth</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Free &amp; Clear Liquid Cleanser is now cleanser of choice.</li>
            <li>Thanks for selling as describes!</li>
            <li>Have been using Free and Clear shampoo and conditioner so thought I&#x27;d try this.</li>
            <li>As I reviewed the refill version of this cleanser (which I returned), I thought I should post the same review here, since most would start with this</li>
            <li>I have been using Free &amp; Clear for 10 years</li>
            <li>Free &amp; Clear cleans the hands thoroughly without drying.  </li>
            <li>For the hands Free &amp; Clear cannot be beat.</li>
            <li>My son has a lot of skin problems, and I am always looking for free &amp; clear type items.</li>
            <li>Funny that I have no problems with a lot of OTC moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is that I don&#x27;t love is this face/body wash.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft and clean and I do not have to worry about my skin getting exposed by some BS chemicals.</li>
            <li>They all were kind of a let down--either too abrasive and drying or simply didn&#x27;t live up to the &amp;#34;clear face&amp;#34; claim.</li>
            <li>Thanks free and clear!</li>
            <li>Free and Clear certainly is what it promotes</li>
            <li>I think this entire brand is amazing for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Squeeze half a pump of Free and Clear, lather nicely all over face for 30 seconds then rinse</li>
            <li>This liquid cleanser is very effective in cleaning water soluble substances and more free of unnecessary or undesirable substances than any other I know about.  </li>
            <li>This foams up really well and is very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>I like this better than cetaphil (my previous tried and true) because i like the lathering.</li>
            <li>I was so hopeful after reading all of the positive reviews for this cleanser</li>
            <li>I AM GIVING THIS A HIGHER RATING THAN USUAL BECAUSE IT DOES A GREAT JOB AT CLEANSING AND NO HEAVY MASKING PARFUMES.</li>
            <li>There are so few cleansers targeted for this skin type, so I am very glad to have found this one after trying over 40 cleansers (ranging from drugstore to luxury-priced ones over $50).</li>
            <li>They have never broken out, it doesn&#x27;t dry their skin out and it leave them smelling very fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>My daughter doesn&#x27;t love the same, mainly because there isn&#x27;t one.  </li>
            <li>I almost forgot what plain ol&#x27; clean feels like because most hand soaps have added garbage that moisturize, exfoliate, etc.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because my son has super sensitive eczema prone skin.</li>
            <li>use La Roche Posey products for my super sensitive face and this on my body.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>This is great for frequent use without causing excessive dryness or irritation.  </li>
            <li>Pure, non stinging, and neutral in the drying arena - I like it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This smells like nothing, cleans well, and is gentle.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cause a rash, cleans gently, and has no fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so gentle</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so gentle</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t break out as much as i use to...</li>
            <li>I have twins who are very allergic to almost anything that touches their skin.  </li>
            <li>I was using Cetaphil and even though it&#x27;s &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; and gentle</li>
            <li>Gentle, but still break out.</li>
            <li>It really works well.</li>
            <li>Being a woman is sometimes like having a chemistry set attached to your body and can be a real pain.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes life so much easier.</li>
            <li>the combination really works well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Gentle.</li>
            <li>The info seemed like it might be reasonable ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Really Fragrance-Free and it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have alot of skin issues and this product works very well.  </li>
            <li>it really does the job.</li>
            <li>Almost too much lather</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t mind it too much but out of the three brands I tried this one</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>GENTLE TO THE SKIN.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle</li>
            <li>You do not have to much.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t bother me much.  </li>
            <li>As for the cleanser - it works really well.</li>
            <li>I prefer Sebamed Face and Body Wash, which is much gentler on my skin.</li>
            <li>I use it after playing with my dogs, when my hands tend to really itch.</li>
            <li>Cleans very well without all of the drama of additives and perfumes.  </li>
            <li>I started using Free &amp; Clear cleanser for sensitive skin about a month ago.</li>
            <li>What makes Free &amp; Clear a superior product compared to most hand cleansers is that it does not include any fragrances, dyes, lanolin, parabens or other potentially irritating ingredients.  </li>
            <li>&gt;( I do use organic coconut oil on my face too - at night and in the am unless I need the Vanicream sun screen first thing in the morning - live in FL)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>which one of the facial products would be the culprit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to stop using this Free and Clear cleanser first.  </li>
            <li>Seems to larger well and gets you clean.</li>
            <li>It lathers just enough and rinses cleanly without any residue.</li>
            <li>It is light, foaming, fragance-free, gentle, leaves no residue, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>I had previously seen good results with both the bar soap and shampoo from the same company, but this caused my son&#x27;s skin to itch as soon as I put it on him.  </li>
            <li>The bottle lasts a long time and is free of perfumes and chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pregnant with my third right now and can&#x27;t use my normal facial cleanser thanks to certain ingredients</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended that I switch to this gentle cleanser as part of my new routine.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt immediately better than it had from the harsher scrub that I had been previously using -</li>
            <li>Not only is there no perfume smell, the smell of the cleanser itself is mild and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very natural clean, after this I only use moisturizer and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>My skin didn&#x27;t have that tight and itchy feeling, which was refreshing indeed.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>My eczema flared up after having the baby, and with the frequent hand washing, it caused really severe cracking.</li>
            <li>but if you have normal to oily or acne prone skin you will appreciate its texture.  </li>
            <li>If I use regular hand soap with fragrances, my hands dry out super quickly.</li>
            <li>have Free and Clear shampoo too, along with Nutragena&#x27;s T-sals and Head and Shoulder for sensitive skin, which I use alternately.  </li>
            <li>Use it all the time, is one of the few soaps I can use for psoriasis &amp; not have any reaction, and I have tried many hand soaps.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve rarely had problems with any face soap, and I&#x27;ve never had facial skin issues.  </li>
            <li>I use it every day to wash my face and it is very gentle and does not dry my skin.</li>
            <li>Priced right and actually works!</li>
            <li>I have to wash my hands 30-40 times/day and this product is the first one that does not dry my skin by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>what ever product that was the new &amp;#34;it&amp;#34; product of the year.</li>
            <li>As a new mother, I am washing my hands all the time.</li>
            <li>Other hand soaps typically strip my skin and I can smell the remnants of their fake/terrible melon or orange or apple scents for a good 15 minutes afterwards, horrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now that I found out this fact about the cleanser, I watched carefully, and I realized that every time I used the Free and Clear shampoo, my forehead would swell up and gets itchy.  </li>
            <li>After one use, my skin was super dry and flaky.  </li>
            <li>My 3 year old son has battled with mild to moderate eczema for nearly 2 years.  </li>
            <li>These may be a little more expensive than regular soaps, but for what you&#x27;re getting, and even more important, for what you&#x27;re NOT GETTING, they are very affordable.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Makes skin very soft as well.  </li>
            <li>Item is moslty used by my wife, she has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I bought this after my allergist recommended it as I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive reactive</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive combination skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This was recommended by my dermatologist because I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for several years now and it is very gentle on my face and doesn&#x27;t cause me to have breakouts.</li>
            <li>Seems to be from Vanicream Lotion company and keep getting it due to kids ecema and reduced significantly</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I had a severe case of contact dermatitis and this product help clear it up by not introducing chemicals that irritated the new skin.</li>
            <li>Less is definitely more when it comes to your skin, especially if you suffer with sensitivities.  </li>
            <li>I have many sensitivities and have had a hard time finding products I can use.</li>
            <li>#34;hands, face and body&amp;#34;, and is free of a whole bunch of common irritants and is fragrance-free</li>
            <li>I was using the Vanicream lotion on him, and it helped, but didn&#x27;t quite clear it all the way.  </li>
            <li>We now all use this soap, it is definitely clear and scent-free, no skin causing problems, and it does feel like it&#x27;s cleaning you (which was the biggest concern).</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m 20 years old.</li>
            <li>it gets old explaining to people what is on my face.  </li>
            <li>I use it on myself and on my 2 and 3 year old.</li>
            <li>I have been using it on them since they were 6 months old</li>
            <li>My 4 1/2 yr old daughter has eczema and this was recommended by our pediatric Dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>My son has severe ezczema on his hands and this has been very helpful in clearing and preventing further breakfood.  </li>
            <li>I tried this stuff at our allergists office and WOW</li>
            <li>I recomend it to anyone with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>but once I use WOW is the word.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a cleanser for my 2y old with eczema.</li>
            <li>But his skin has stayed soft with this soap after a week of washing.</li>
            <li>u can find in the store for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>skin is soft after usage.</li>
            <li>is my least favorite.</li>
            <li>My husband and I both have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I could hardly open my eyes, and my whole face was burning and hurting and itching</li>
            <li>My husband loves this cleanser for his sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This product is suppose to be for sensitive skin but it irritated my skin @ was too drying.</li>
            <li>I used to spend so much money on those Japanese brands</li>
            <li>I use this for my 6 month old who has eczema.</li>
            <li>For me it&#x27;s not just &amp;#34;scents&amp;#34; that I am sensitive to</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend any of the Vanicream products for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So I need an extremely gentle facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>I appreciate this as I am gentle with my face and the last thing I want to do is scrub and scrub to wash my cleanser off of my face.1 pump of this cleanser</li>
            <li>is all I need to gently wash my entire face.</li>
            <li>I like it so far.  </li>
            <li>My husband has extremely sensitive skin and can&#x27;t tolerate any fragrance in products that touch his skin.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin that is also sensitive.</li>
            <li>My four year old daughter has extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is still too early in the year to tell if this will limit the severity of the eczema (worsens during the winter),  but for now this has dramatically improved the texture and condition of a persistent parch of eczema near his mouth, as well as made the persistent keratosis pilaris bumps on his cheeks disappear.  </li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was intrigued when I first found this product line, but in actual practice the cleanser barely does the job.</li>
            <li>and I always have to moisturize immediately afterward because my skin is very dry, but just for the sake of testing this product, I didn&#x27;t moisturize right away.</li>
            <li>well water is currently very soft and this barely lathers.</li>
            <li>After two years of frustration, trying to figure out why my skin broke out in small rashes, I stopped using OTC liquid soaps and started using Free &amp; Clear liquid soap and shampoo.</li>
            <li>I was curious and started using it myself and really like the results!</li>
            <li>Cleans your skin yet doesn&#x27;t dry it and Is free of perfumes and alot of other ingredients that cause allergies.</li>
            <li>My sensitive skin had been breaking out recently and nothing seemed to be working to clear it up.  </li>
            <li>Have very sensitive skin - this is the only product that cleans pores without harshness.</li>
            <li>and I have not had any major breakouts since using this cleanser so for those reasons I give it four stars</li>
            <li>Great product.....not harmful...free from anything we think we need and cleans deeply with out irritating!!  </li>
            <li>It saved my sons live who always had dry skin and sensitive skin it was recommended by our doctor .Thanks</li>
            <li>Additionally, it&#x27;s cheap and a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>so hard to find fragrence free, unscented products.....</li>
            <li>We  use for general hand washing and for bath time with ease.  </li>
            <li>Only thing that helped clear up my exzema</li>
            <li>We were using a steroid cream almost daily for nearly a year.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have dry skin, but I do have older skin</li>
            <li>Especially for someone with allergies and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I buy this for my 87 year old mother, it&#x27;s the only cleanser that does not irritate her eyes.</li>
            <li>It makes my hands feel nice and clean: not stripped but not moisturized from extra crap</li>
            <li>I have suffered so much, and damaged my body by using prednisone, hydrocortisone and other harmful drugs to control the flareups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And yes it is unscented but unlike some other products this is very pleasing to my nose.</li>
            <li>I recently found out I am allergic to a very common biocide found in many liquid cleansers (laundry detergent, dish detergent, hand soap, body wash, shampoo, etc)</li>
            <li>Gentle lather and doesn&#x27;t leave my sensitive oily combo acne skin irritated or dried out.</li>
            <li>Use a NATURAL face lotion such as North American Hemp Co to balance your skin&#x27;s pH and moisturize&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a chemically sensitive individual, this is the only soap on the market that my body tolerates.</li>
            <li>Does not dry skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t not dry out my skin and yet makes it feel</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that when I left my first bottle in the shower, water must have been getting in through the cap somehow because I noticed the consistency had gotten significantly watered down.  </li>
            <li>and it never really went away or felt like normal skin.  </li>
            <li>I also have dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I developed small bumps on my cheeks and forehead and continued to get really dry/flakey skin.</li>
            <li>In a world full of over fragranced irritating body washes, this is one of the only options for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is a very gentle cleanser that does not leave your skin feeling dry and tight.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love what it doesn&#x27;t have in it!</li>

            <li> My sister is allergic to products with any kind of fragrance</li>
            <li> Perfect for sensitive skin and for eczema and psoriasis.</li>
            <li> she has been using this for a while and finds that it is the best wash that she has used so far.</li>
            <li> but if you have sensitive girly area&#x27;s this is THEE best thing i have ever used.</li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST face cleanser I have found.</li>
            <li> This said it&#x27;s suitable for &amp;</li>
            <li> I bought one for my bathroom sink and one for the kitchen sink, and will probably add it to my shower too if I can&#x27;t find a suitable body wash.</li>

            <li> No bad ingredients to cause breakouts!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> My favorite face wash..</li>
            <li> so glad I got it</li>
            <li> This cleanser can even be used for babies and is recommended by many pediatricians and dermatologists.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is so wonderful and simple.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> If you like Vanicream products you will love this.</li>
            <li> I bought for my daughter with allergies to use and she hasn&#x27;t seemed to have any troubles although her skin hasn&#x27;t gotten any better</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> So now I am always sure to just use it by the sink.</li>
            <li> All are great products and I am really grateful for the lack of perfumes, masking fragrances, and unneeded botanical ingredients that could cause allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love love love this soap for my excema-sensitive babies.  </li>
            <li> I searched for a soap that would help with my daughters eczema and didn&#x27;t have anything that could irritate her skin allergies more.</li>
            <li> I find many Health Food Products contain too many herb and flower extracts.</li>
            <li> If you like it be sure to look at the 32 oz refill</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> Love their products!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Just bought it in the bigger refill size which is awesome!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with how this product left my skin and did not cause any reactions/redness.  </li>
            <li> I love this cleanser for my face.</li>
            <li> For this price I&#x27;d expect a lot more.</li>
            <li> For anyone suffering with Eczema or Atopic Eczema this product&lt;br /&gt;is the most &amp;#34;FREE AND CLEAR&amp;#34; that I have been able to locate.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this item for more than a year</li>
            <li> My skin is getting better and better.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not awful either</li>
            <li> I am allergic to most shampoos and cleansers as they contain detergent like chemicals, as in sulfates.  </li>
            <li> I love love the ointment, cream and &amp;#34;lite&amp;#34; lotion.  </li>
            <li> Can I say, I absolutely love this soap.  </li>
            <li> , if it was more moisturizing I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.</li>
            <li> After use it leaves your face clean feeling, not squeaky clean like some bars of soap, but a real nice clean.</li>
            <li> Affordable, light and does the trick... Cleans my face &amp; controls breakouts!</li>
            <li> (nothing is :) ).</li>
            <li> Nice lather, washes off clean.</li>
            <li> Will continue to buy from Amazon as long as they keep offering the best prices!</li>
            <li> It cleans my face perfectly without leaving it dry</li>
            <li> Works great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> This is a great face wash for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> have bought this same brand&#x27;s SPF 50, and that seems to be very good.</li>
            <li> Like the shampoo and conditioner made by this company, this is a great soap for the chemically sensitive person.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great soap for sensitive hands.</li>
            <li> Great for people with eczema or sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Great face/hand/body wash for those of us with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for babies or kids with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great product for overly sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and does not react kindly to cleansers of any kind.</li>
            <li> use other Vanicream products too - wonderful line.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product without all the junk in other soaps.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like Cetaphil in mildness but seems to clean better as I dont have eczema on my forehead.</li>
            <li> Free and Clear is a great product that I have been using for over two years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that easy to find</li>
            <li> Lather occurs more frequently when a product is alkaline, which is not as good for skin.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use much, it gives a good lather, and rinses clean.  </li>
            <li> My teenager uses free and clear for cleansing her face, works great for her skin, keeps it clean from breaking out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just fine and priced well.  </li>
            <li> The cleanser isn&#x27;t really that strong, which i kinda liked (i thought i wouldn&#x27;t)...</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, cleared up breakouts I had been experiencing,  super gentle and effective at removing all my makeup.</li>
            <li> I would not expect that to have something scent and dye free</li>
            <li> Whenever I have people over, someone always comes out of the bathroom raving about this soap, and I even find that a diluted solution of about 1 to 1 suits my purposes (light living, not a motor rebuilding hobbyist).</li>
            <li> IT doesn&#x27;t say tear free but never seems to bother them when it gets in their eyes.</li>
            <li> In two days I was rash free and remain after months of use.</li>
            <li> Frangrance free too.</li>
            <li> It washes well, there&#x27;s no offensive scent and it leaves the skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ever put great smells above your health.</li>
            <li> and I like to use products that are alcohol, parfum, dyes and etc free.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the scent too much, even though it is unscented.&lt;br /&gt;Not a scent of flowers or fruits, but a kind of masking odor which I do not like.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The liquid is so light it feels almost like water on your skin.</li>
            <li> We chose this product because it is formaldehyde and scent free -- that says it all for us.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a handy ready to use anywhere dispenser</li>
            <li> I appreciate that it is fragrance and sulfate free</li>
            <li> We are still enjoying this cleanser, &amp; it&#x27;s worth a repurchase for me, but it&#x27;s no miracle</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, this is superior to Phisoderm.  </li>
            <li> I have heard from others that they found this to be too drying for their skin, in which case I would recommend using along with Complex15 facial creme (which is now best ordered overseas or from eBay as it is no longer available at a reasonable price here in the states.  </li>
            <li> So far so good....</li>
            <li> This product foams and cleanses very nicely without causing me to have red, blotchy reactions to its ingredients.</li>
            <li> but it does clean well and does not leave a film.</li>
            <li> There is no scent and it will leave you clean without ruining your skin.</li>
            <li> My skin feels clean after use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does clean well, though.</li>
            <li> Gets them clean without breaking them out.</li>
            <li> I use it to preserve the health of my skin and to clean the brushes I use to do art work while avoiding the accidental introduction of impurities into my art work after cleaning brushes.</li>
            <li> , just CLEAN.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this so far</li>
            <li> I always use this product after I clean my make up with a makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, I think any body wash would do what this did.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand&#x27;s hair gel for my infant (you hear that right!)</li>
            <li> Truth be told, I would have liked a little bit more of a moisturized feel, but it&#x27;s ok just as it</li>
            <li> This product, however, i feel is a good middle ground.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have much more to say about it.  </li>
            <li> This soap is full of chemicals.</li>
            <li> Love that it is refillable at a fairly reasonable price.</li>
            <li> For those with oily/ sensitive skin I have a pretty good</li>
            <li> My daughters have extreme eczema and this works great for them...</li>
            <li> Mild and non-allergenic.  </li>
            <li> now I can only save more money but also get better skin.</li>
            <li> I also find that it does a very good job of removing my make up (although I don&#x27;t usually wear a lot).  </li>
            <li> I have normal skin and just love it.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is a good value, works well, doesn&#x27;t dry out their skin and has caused no irritation.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s gentle, doesn&#x27;t sting, and suds up easily.</li>
            <li> The Free &amp; Clear is very silky and seems to clean even better than the Cetaphil I was using.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> Free and Clear works great, cleans and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li> --it is a great cleanser for anyone who has any sensitivities, be they to harsh chemicals or to overpowering scents.</li>
            <li> I am happy to say that he hasn&#x27;t had a flare up since a few days after we started using this.  </li>
            <li> After all these years of Elephant man face, I&#x27;m back to my own</li>
            <li> great for sensitive skin and use before topical treatments and vanicream.</li>
            <li> this is a great option for kids who have sensitive skin, especially on their hands.</li>
            <li> This product is great for sensitive facial skin.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t argue with the sensitivity issues, which more people may need than I did (I just naturally prefer fewer chemicals).</li>
            <li> Still, I would hope for more lathering and cleaning action from even a generous amount of product.</li>
            <li> are worth the price.</li>
            <li> an honest, simple clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It has a nice lather, semi-low lathering but still enough to satisfy the senses and feels silky in the hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the $$-</li>
            <li> We are also dealing with the occasional pimple, &amp; I am pleased to say that this cleaner is uniquely cleansing yet moisturizing without leaving a residue,</li>
            <li> This may be good for other people but not for me.</li>
            <li> Right now I am also using for wash at night is Neutrogena&#x27;s Naturals with willowbark.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super gentle for the most sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s more than your average hand soap but his comfort and healthy skin</li>
            <li> I thought I needed a daily scrub to get everything clean, but this very gentle cleanser does that for me and does it way better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have not used a cleanser that is more gentle.</li>
            <li> Cheapest price is on Amazon and there is a large refill too!</li>
            <li> It lathers nice and doesn&#x27;t dry out his hands.</li>
            <li> I have very very SUPER sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I cannot use any other it is so easy to use and makes my  face feel clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and it doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling tight after washing, so it has been a good cleanser to use.</li>
            <li> This is very gentle and haven&#x27;t had this problem with this product.  </li>
            <li> It has no smell, but cleans very gently.  </li>
            <li> Very gentle.</li>
            <li> This stuff really seems to work!  </li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> I will definately purchase again when my first bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> My daughter has many allergies and will get red rashes and hives from some cleansers.  </li>
            <li> Free and Clear of anything from nature.</li>
            <li> We ditched this, but still use the Vanicream bar soap and Free and Clear Shampoo.</li>
            <li> Our granddaughter has eczema and this is the first cleanser that doesn&#x27;t burn her skin.  </li>
            <li> Steam face with a hot washcloth</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Free &amp; Clear Liquid Cleanser is now cleanser of choice.</li>
            <li> Thanks for selling as describes!</li>
            <li> Have been using Free and Clear shampoo and conditioner so thought I&#x27;d try this.</li>
            <li> As I reviewed the refill version of this cleanser (which I returned), I thought I should post the same review here, since most would start with this</li>
            <li> I have been using Free &amp; Clear for 10 years</li>
            <li> Free &amp; Clear cleans the hands thoroughly without drying.  </li>
            <li> For the hands Free &amp; Clear cannot be beat.</li>
            <li> My son has a lot of skin problems, and I am always looking for free &amp; clear type items.</li>
            <li> Funny that I have no problems with a lot of OTC moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is that I don&#x27;t love is this face/body wash.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft and clean and I do not have to worry about my skin getting exposed by some BS chemicals.</li>
            <li> They all were kind of a let down--either too abrasive and drying or simply didn&#x27;t live up to the &amp;#34;clear face&amp;#34; claim.</li>
            <li> Thanks free and clear!</li>
            <li> Free and Clear certainly is what it promotes</li>
            <li> I think this entire brand is amazing for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Squeeze half a pump of Free and Clear, lather nicely all over face for 30 seconds then rinse</li>
            <li> This liquid cleanser is very effective in cleaning water soluble substances and more free of unnecessary or undesirable substances than any other I know about.  </li>
            <li> This foams up really well and is very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> I like this better than cetaphil (my previous tried and true) because i like the lathering.</li>
            <li> I was so hopeful after reading all of the positive reviews for this cleanser</li>
            <li> I AM GIVING THIS A HIGHER RATING THAN USUAL BECAUSE IT DOES A GREAT JOB AT CLEANSING AND NO HEAVY MASKING PARFUMES.</li>
            <li> There are so few cleansers targeted for this skin type, so I am very glad to have found this one after trying over 40 cleansers (ranging from drugstore to luxury-priced ones over $50).</li>
            <li> They have never broken out, it doesn&#x27;t dry their skin out and it leave them smelling very fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> My daughter doesn&#x27;t love the same, mainly because there isn&#x27;t one.  </li>
            <li> I almost forgot what plain ol&#x27; clean feels like because most hand soaps have added garbage that moisturize, exfoliate, etc.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because my son has super sensitive eczema prone skin.</li>
            <li> use La Roche Posey products for my super sensitive face and this on my body.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> This is great for frequent use without causing excessive dryness or irritation.  </li>
            <li> Pure, non stinging, and neutral in the drying arena - I like it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This smells like nothing, cleans well, and is gentle.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cause a rash, cleans gently, and has no fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so gentle</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so gentle</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t break out as much as i use to...</li>
            <li> I have twins who are very allergic to almost anything that touches their skin.  </li>
            <li> I was using Cetaphil and even though it&#x27;s &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; and gentle</li>
            <li> Gentle, but still break out.</li>
            <li> It really works well.</li>
            <li> Being a woman is sometimes like having a chemistry set attached to your body and can be a real pain.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes life so much easier.</li>
            <li> the combination really works well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Gentle.</li>
            <li> The info seemed like it might be reasonable ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Really Fragrance-Free and it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have alot of skin issues and this product works very well.  </li>
            <li> it really does the job.</li>
            <li> Almost too much lather</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t mind it too much but out of the three brands I tried this one</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> GENTLE TO THE SKIN.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle</li>
            <li> You do not have to much.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t bother me much.  </li>
            <li> As for the cleanser - it works really well.</li>
            <li> I prefer Sebamed Face and Body Wash, which is much gentler on my skin.</li>
            <li> I use it after playing with my dogs, when my hands tend to really itch.</li>
            <li> Cleans very well without all of the drama of additives and perfumes.  </li>
            <li> I started using Free &amp; Clear cleanser for sensitive skin about a month ago.</li>
            <li> What makes Free &amp; Clear a superior product compared to most hand cleansers is that it does not include any fragrances, dyes, lanolin, parabens or other potentially irritating ingredients.  </li>
            <li> &gt;( I do use organic coconut oil on my face too - at night and in the am unless I need the Vanicream sun screen first thing in the morning - live in FL)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> which one of the facial products would be the culprit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to stop using this Free and Clear cleanser first.  </li>
            <li> Seems to larger well and gets you clean.</li>
            <li> It lathers just enough and rinses cleanly without any residue.</li>
            <li> It is light, foaming, fragance-free, gentle, leaves no residue, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I had previously seen good results with both the bar soap and shampoo from the same company, but this caused my son&#x27;s skin to itch as soon as I put it on him.  </li>
            <li> The bottle lasts a long time and is free of perfumes and chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pregnant with my third right now and can&#x27;t use my normal facial cleanser thanks to certain ingredients</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended that I switch to this gentle cleanser as part of my new routine.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt immediately better than it had from the harsher scrub that I had been previously using -</li>
            <li> Not only is there no perfume smell, the smell of the cleanser itself is mild and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very natural clean, after this I only use moisturizer and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> My skin didn&#x27;t have that tight and itchy feeling, which was refreshing indeed.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My eczema flared up after having the baby, and with the frequent hand washing, it caused really severe cracking.</li>
            <li> but if you have normal to oily or acne prone skin you will appreciate its texture.  </li>
            <li> If I use regular hand soap with fragrances, my hands dry out super quickly.</li>
            <li> have Free and Clear shampoo too, along with Nutragena&#x27;s T-sals and Head and Shoulder for sensitive skin, which I use alternately.  </li>
            <li> Use it all the time, is one of the few soaps I can use for psoriasis &amp; not have any reaction, and I have tried many hand soaps.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve rarely had problems with any face soap, and I&#x27;ve never had facial skin issues.  </li>
            <li> I use it every day to wash my face and it is very gentle and does not dry my skin.</li>
            <li> Priced right and actually works!</li>
            <li> I have to wash my hands 30-40 times/day and this product is the first one that does not dry my skin by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> what ever product that was the new &amp;#34;it&amp;#34; product of the year.</li>
            <li> As a new mother, I am washing my hands all the time.</li>
            <li> Other hand soaps typically strip my skin and I can smell the remnants of their fake/terrible melon or orange or apple scents for a good 15 minutes afterwards, horrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now that I found out this fact about the cleanser, I watched carefully, and I realized that every time I used the Free and Clear shampoo, my forehead would swell up and gets itchy.  </li>
            <li> After one use, my skin was super dry and flaky.  </li>
            <li> My 3 year old son has battled with mild to moderate eczema for nearly 2 years.  </li>
            <li> These may be a little more expensive than regular soaps, but for what you&#x27;re getting, and even more important, for what you&#x27;re NOT GETTING, they are very affordable.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Makes skin very soft as well.  </li>
            <li> Item is moslty used by my wife, she has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I bought this after my allergist recommended it as I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive reactive</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive combination skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist because I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several years now and it is very gentle on my face and doesn&#x27;t cause me to have breakouts.</li>
            <li> Seems to be from Vanicream Lotion company and keep getting it due to kids ecema and reduced significantly</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I had a severe case of contact dermatitis and this product help clear it up by not introducing chemicals that irritated the new skin.</li>
            <li> Less is definitely more when it comes to your skin, especially if you suffer with sensitivities.  </li>
            <li> I have many sensitivities and have had a hard time finding products I can use.</li>
            <li> #34;hands, face and body&amp;#34;, and is free of a whole bunch of common irritants and is fragrance-free</li>
            <li> I was using the Vanicream lotion on him, and it helped, but didn&#x27;t quite clear it all the way.  </li>
            <li> We now all use this soap, it is definitely clear and scent-free, no skin causing problems, and it does feel like it&#x27;s cleaning you (which was the biggest concern).</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m 20 years old.</li>
            <li> it gets old explaining to people what is on my face.  </li>
            <li> I use it on myself and on my 2 and 3 year old.</li>
            <li> I have been using it on them since they were 6 months old</li>
            <li> My 4 1/2 yr old daughter has eczema and this was recommended by our pediatric Dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> My son has severe ezczema on his hands and this has been very helpful in clearing and preventing further breakfood.  </li>
            <li> I tried this stuff at our allergists office and WOW</li>
            <li> I recomend it to anyone with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> but once I use WOW is the word.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a cleanser for my 2y old with eczema.</li>
            <li> But his skin has stayed soft with this soap after a week of washing.</li>
            <li> u can find in the store for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> skin is soft after usage.</li>
            <li> is my least favorite.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I could hardly open my eyes, and my whole face was burning and hurting and itching</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cleanser for his sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This product is suppose to be for sensitive skin but it irritated my skin @ was too drying.</li>
            <li> I used to spend so much money on those Japanese brands</li>
            <li> I use this for my 6 month old who has eczema.</li>
            <li> For me it&#x27;s not just &amp;#34;scents&amp;#34; that I am sensitive to</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend any of the Vanicream products for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So I need an extremely gentle facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> I appreciate this as I am gentle with my face and the last thing I want to do is scrub and scrub to wash my cleanser off of my face.1 pump of this cleanser</li>
            <li> is all I need to gently wash my entire face.</li>
            <li> I like it so far.  </li>
            <li> My husband has extremely sensitive skin and can&#x27;t tolerate any fragrance in products that touch his skin.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that is also sensitive.</li>
            <li> My four year old daughter has extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is still too early in the year to tell if this will limit the severity of the eczema (worsens during the winter),  but for now this has dramatically improved the texture and condition of a persistent parch of eczema near his mouth, as well as made the persistent keratosis pilaris bumps on his cheeks disappear.  </li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was intrigued when I first found this product line, but in actual practice the cleanser barely does the job.</li>
            <li> and I always have to moisturize immediately afterward because my skin is very dry, but just for the sake of testing this product, I didn&#x27;t moisturize right away.</li>
            <li> well water is currently very soft and this barely lathers.</li>
            <li> After two years of frustration, trying to figure out why my skin broke out in small rashes, I stopped using OTC liquid soaps and started using Free &amp; Clear liquid soap and shampoo.</li>
            <li> I was curious and started using it myself and really like the results!</li>
            <li> Cleans your skin yet doesn&#x27;t dry it and Is free of perfumes and alot of other ingredients that cause allergies.</li>
            <li> My sensitive skin had been breaking out recently and nothing seemed to be working to clear it up.  </li>
            <li> Have very sensitive skin - this is the only product that cleans pores without harshness.</li>
            <li> and I have not had any major breakouts since using this cleanser so for those reasons I give it four stars</li>
            <li> Great product.....not harmful...free from anything we think we need and cleans deeply with out irritating!!  </li>
            <li> It saved my sons live who always had dry skin and sensitive skin it was recommended by our doctor .Thanks</li>
            <li> Additionally, it&#x27;s cheap and a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> so hard to find fragrence free, unscented products.....</li>
            <li> We  use for general hand washing and for bath time with ease.  </li>
            <li> Only thing that helped clear up my exzema</li>
            <li> We were using a steroid cream almost daily for nearly a year.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dry skin, but I do have older skin</li>
            <li> Especially for someone with allergies and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I buy this for my 87 year old mother, it&#x27;s the only cleanser that does not irritate her eyes.</li>
            <li> It makes my hands feel nice and clean: not stripped but not moisturized from extra crap</li>
            <li> I have suffered so much, and damaged my body by using prednisone, hydrocortisone and other harmful drugs to control the flareups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And yes it is unscented but unlike some other products this is very pleasing to my nose.</li>
            <li> I recently found out I am allergic to a very common biocide found in many liquid cleansers (laundry detergent, dish detergent, hand soap, body wash, shampoo, etc)</li>
            <li> Gentle lather and doesn&#x27;t leave my sensitive oily combo acne skin irritated or dried out.</li>
            <li> Use a NATURAL face lotion such as North American Hemp Co to balance your skin&#x27;s pH and moisturize&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a chemically sensitive individual, this is the only soap on the market that my body tolerates.</li>
            <li> Does not dry skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t not dry out my skin and yet makes it feel</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that when I left my first bottle in the shower, water must have been getting in through the cap somehow because I noticed the consistency had gotten significantly watered down.  </li>
            <li> and it never really went away or felt like normal skin.  </li>
            <li> I also have dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I developed small bumps on my cheeks and forehead and continued to get really dry/flakey skin.</li>
            <li> In a world full of over fragranced irritating body washes, this is one of the only options for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is a very gentle cleanser that does not leave your skin feeling dry and tight.</li>
            <li> After trying what seemed like endless cleansers for my 12 year old&#x27;s facial eczema &amp; keratosis pilaris, it seems the search is finally over.  </li>
            <li> Squeeze another half a pump of Free and Clear and lather, this time rinse with ice cold water to close those pesky large pores</li>
            <li> I have eczema (red, tight, shiny, pustule spotted, very sensitive) only on my face.  </li>
            <li> Decided I would try this due to my allergies, asthma, eczema and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Keep buying it due to natural qualities.  </li>
            <li> and my face had been red and swollen and dry and peeling and weeping for the last several years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying I have really normal skin, a little oily in the T-zone.  </li>
            <li> just bought this cleanser instead of my usual Whole Foods purchases.</li>
            <li> No fragrance and no soapy mess left on hands if not rinsed completely.</li>
            <li> Does not leave your skin extra dry</li>
            <li> combine that with middle age, and now I battle break outs AND dry skin.</li>
            <li> only reason for 4 stars: small bottle, large amount of product it takes esp if using a wash cloth and minimal lathering.</li>
            <li> I tried cheap drug store stuff, expensive stuff, women, men..</li>
            <li> Clear dispensing face/body wash without all the harsh chemicals...</li>
            <li> My son has had small eczema patches here and there on his body since he was born and his skin was sensitive overall.</li>
            <li> I plan on using this for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few cleansers so far that I can use with no reaction.  </li>
            <li> Purchasing the larger refill container cuts down on costs and just refill the smaller dispensers.</li>
            <li> They last a long time and although they don&#x27;t lather as well as a few reviewers have written, that doesn&#x27;t make them bad, it actually means they&#x27;re better!</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t leave my face red and splotchy like other products.</li>
            <li> is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the refill AND a pump bottle at the same time based on a trial sample I ordered from the manufacturer and other reviews at a makeup site.  </li>
            <li> I use it in the shower every morning on my face and my skin doesn&#x27;t get red and stripped like with other face washes.</li>
            <li> This 8 oz bottle lasts a very long time!&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Does the job well without making your skin feel parched and dry.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face.</li>
            <li> I have combination oily/dry skin - mostly dry.</li>
            <li> If you have acne or really dry skin, it never hurts to cut out sulfates and fragrance to see what could be contributing to your issues.</li>
            <li> Liquid Cleanser doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out or irritate her skin at all.</li>
            <li> This soap does well to keep the hives/rashes at bay from allergic reactions to chemicals, however I have to also combine it with Vanicream lotion because this soap does nothing to assist with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Noticed that my skin is really dry since using it.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t dry my already flaky skin out like the fragrance bodywash and soaps.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Fragrance&amp;#34; is considered a trade secret, which means corporations don&#x27;t have to disclose EXACTLY what they put in it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for anyone troubled with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> You only need a little too.  </li>
            <li> I do still need to moisturize my face, but my test showed that it&#x27;s at least not harsh in any way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very moisturizing</li>
            <li> They have minimal ingredients, so fewer things to be allergic to.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist to causing minimal irritation to my skin.</li>
            <li> my hands didn&#x27;t itch, dry out or hurt afterwards!!  </li>
            <li> At daycare my son was coming home with very dry patches on his hands due to all the washing.  </li>
            <li> It also lathers well and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It has no fragrance, does not burn, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Use african black soap on face + neck (a few times a week)&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> my face has never felt dry or tight after using this product.  </li>
            <li> At first I was  skeptical</li>
            <li> And like with all vanicream products a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I had to start using liquid cleanser due to eczema.</li>
            <li> I like the minimal additives and it seemed to do the job!  </li>
            <li> It cleanses the face and leaves it refreshed, not dry and dull looking.</li>
            <li> My child has severe active eczema, allergies, and asthma.  </li>
            <li> She was having rash after rash and other odd skin conditions until the dermatologist suggested this brand for all her cleanser, shampoo, conditioner, ect.  </li>
            <li> It is filled with chemicals and bad ingredients -- couldn&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> After realizing that the mysterious &amp;#34;parfum&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; was the common factor in all of the products that caused irritation to my face and scalp, stumbling upon this affordable fragrance-free product was so relieving.</li>
            <li> only complaint is the price.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is I can&#x27;t get all the liquid out with the pump.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, a little goes a long way, I only need a very small amount for hand washing, not a full pump - maybe not even half a pump, so that helps take the some of the sting out of the price.</li>
            <li> Now I can run down the beach with my boyfriend holding hands or something....</li>
            <li> Like some of the other reviewers, I do find it a little drying.</li>
            <li> I was unable to use this product as it dried my skin out too much.  </li>
            <li> A Ph balanced product tends to lather less, but still cleans as well.</li>
            <li> (Stings like crazy on sensitive skin, but your skin will glow when you wake up the next morning)&lt;br</li>
            <li> that is typically when switching products.</li>
            <li> that I stopped using this product, I am less reactive to foods now.  </li>
            <li> But I was still on prednisone,which would mess up the results.  </li>
            <li> The others either leave my skin too tight feeling, or too moisturized where it still feels like there is cleanser on it-</li>
            <li> helps to keep my eczema in check but a little pricey</li>
            <li> meant that it would be so harsh.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for a few years.</li>
            <li> After using it to wash my hands, my skin was so dried out.</li>
            <li> Harsh is damaging to ALL skin types.</li>
            <li> However, this product was too harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> a few times&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> Takes a generous amount just to start a lather (using a natural sea sponge) but fails to keep it going.</li>
            <li> If you have been searching for something without harsh chemicals and junk that you can not pronounce then this will be up your alley.</li>
            <li> I also like to use the cleanser with a wash cloth to get all the dead skin off my face as well.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy it, but like I said above, if I can find a less expensive eczema-friendly product for body wash</li>
            <li> I have eczema and it&#x27;s hard to find something that will cleanse my skin and not be too harsh.  </li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m not sure if i can contribute it to the cleanser...</li>
            <li> I use it on my fave &amp; body &amp; no more hives or skin issues</li>
            <li> These are small bottles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, i will probably reorder it when i run out...unless i see a dramatic negative effect from using this product for the long term.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t naive enough to think that this cleanser would ward off all flare-ups, but I&#x27;m just disappointed that he&#x27;s still so prone to eczema, if it gets cold &amp; dry enough, he&#x27;ll just end up with at least a little patch.  </li>
            <li> The cleanser pump was open and some cleanser had been leaked allover the box and the other products :(</li>
            <li> I keep a small bottle in my purse now!  </li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t that I didn&#x27;t like the smell, it&#x27;s not pleasant</li>
            <li> Lathers well (not great).</li>
            <li> I got tired of washing and ending up smelling like some chemist&#x27;s idea of a flower, often in an overpowering manner.  </li>
            <li> Even Johnson and Johnson baby products were irritating our preemies&#x27; skin, so we made the switch.</li>
            <li> This prevents the flareups from getting worse.</li>
            <li> It is a thin liquid type cleanser.</li>
            <li> and I think my poor, irritated skin will thank me.</li>
            <li> it is a very small size for the price!</li>
            <li> /&gt;According to the doctor, I flared up from eating wrong foods, because I was ALREADY inflamed from the facial product (meaning this stupid cleanser).  </li>
            <li> I had always thought it was food allergy, because every time I eat something wrong, my face gets worse.  </li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find cleansers without deleterious additives in any stores that I shop.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not something you can quit cold turkey.  </li>
            <li> Ugh, with this cold spell, it looks like my son&#x27;s eczema is flaring up once again, despite the use of this cleanser &amp; jojoba oil.  </li>
            <li> Too bad it&#x27;s not in stores.</li>
            <li> I now stock dispensers &amp; refills of this soap all over the house - while I still have eczema, this prevents it from getting bad.</li>
            <li> and it stung really badly - I&#x27;ve learned not to do that.  </li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> It was awful.  </li>
            <li> It damaged my bones terribly, and I got moon face from it, my candida flared up, my immune system screwed up, and I couldn&#x27;t sleep because of the prednisone.  </li>
            <li> If you need something that you wont be allergic to or you do not want all the nasty chemicals, defiantly choose this one.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Only thing that helped clear up my exzema</li>
            <li> I was so hopeful after reading all of the positive reviews for this cleanser but it was way too drying! I have sensitive/dry skin and I&#x27;m 20 years old. I started washing with this as directed by the instructions but almost immediately I started getting flakey around my nose area and chin area. I thought maybe my skin would balance out after I kept using it but I was wrong. I developed small bumps on my cheeks and forehead and continued to get really dry/flakey skin. I have stopped using it and even after a week my skin isn&#x27;t back to what it was before.</li>
            <li> I started using Free &amp; Clear cleanser for sensitive skin about a month ago. I like the way it suds up, and the way it rinses off. Leaves my skin feeling&lt;br /&gt;soft and my itching episodes have just about stopped happening. My dermatologist recommended this product and I am so glad she did!</li>
            <li> I love these products. I use a variety of them.  My face use to break out finally I have cleared it up.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap that I could use on my infant (now a toddler) without her getting a rash from all the dyes and perfumes they put in infant soaps.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I was unable to use this product as it dried my skin out too much.  I would not expect that to have something scent and dye free meant that it would be so harsh.</li>
            <li> Like the shampoo and conditioner made by this company, this is a great soap for the chemically sensitive person. Does the job well without making your skin feel parched and dry.</li>
            <li> I have eczema (red, tight, shiny, pustule spotted, very sensitive) only on my face.  it gets old explaining to people what is on my face.  My dermatologist was giving me the steroid of the month and it never really went away or felt like normal skin.  I&#x27;ve even been tested for allergies and tried acupuncture.  Then the allergist suggested this cleanser in combo with Vanicream moisturizer before my skin dries.  Its been a miracle.  I highly recommend.  It&#x27;s like Cetaphil in mildness but seems to clean better as I dont have eczema on my forehead.</li>
            <li> Other hand soaps typically strip my skin and I can smell the remnants of their fake/terrible melon or orange or apple scents for a good 15 minutes afterwards, horrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This smells like nothing, cleans well, and is gentle. It is the best! Whenever I have people over, someone always comes out of the bathroom raving about this soap, and I even find that a diluted solution of about 1 to 1 suits my purposes (light living, not a motor rebuilding hobbyist).</li>
            <li> According to my allergist, this is the only truly hypoallergenic product line.  It doesn&#x27;t cause a rash, cleans gently, and has no fragrance.  This product is a life saver.</li>
            <li> Priced right and actually works! No bad ingredients to cause breakouts!!! Cheapest price is on Amazon and there is a large refill too!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin. This product foams and cleanses very nicely without causing me to have red, blotchy reactions to its ingredients. I use it every day to wash my face and it is very gentle and does not dry my skin. Highly recommended for anyone troubled with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser! I use it on myself and on my 2 and 3 year old. It&#x27;s so gentle but it still cleans. Perfect for sensitive skin and for eczema and psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I use this cleanser with a Clarisonic Pro face brush. It is a very gentle cleanser that does not leave your skin feeling dry and tight. Made in Minnesota.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and it&#x27;s hard to find something that will cleanse my skin and not be too harsh.  It&#x27;s so gentle I even used it for my baby&#x27;s bath since I couldn&#x27;t find her baby wash! Perfect cleanser, I will be buying again!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this cleanser. I have to wash my hands 30-40 times/day and this product is the first one that does not dry my skin by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a simple face cleanser for years. I tried cheap drug store stuff, expensive stuff, women, men..what ever product that was the new &amp;#34;it&amp;#34; product of the year. They all were kind of a let down--either too abrasive and drying or simply didn&#x27;t live up to the &amp;#34;clear face&amp;#34; claim. This product, however, i feel is a good middle ground. It&#x27;s relatively inexpensive. The cleanser isn&#x27;t really that strong, which i kinda liked (i thought i wouldn&#x27;t)...it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face. I have mixed feelings about the effectiveness of the product overall. I don&#x27;t break out as much as i use to...but i&#x27;m not sure if i can contribute it to the cleanser...I added the konji sponge to my face cleansing regimen at the same, so it can be that ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, i will probably reorder it when i run out...unless i see a dramatic negative effect from using this product for the long term.</li>
            <li> I have twins who are very allergic to almost anything that touches their skin.  This soap works fantastically.  They have never broken out, it doesn&#x27;t dry their skin out and it leave them smelling very fresh and clean.  I have been using it on them since they were 6 months old and I use it myself.  IT doesn&#x27;t say tear free but never seems to bother them when it gets in their eyes.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin. No odor. Lathers well (not great).</li>
            <li> My 4 1/2 yr old daughter has eczema and this was recommended by our pediatric Dermatologist.  I was using Cetaphil and even though it&#x27;s &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; and gentle, it still contains a masking fragrance that can bother skin.  The Free &amp; Clear is very silky and seems to clean even better than the Cetaphil I was using.  Makes skin very soft as well.  I follow it up with the Vanicream Lotion as well after the bath.  Will definitely buy again-</li>
            <li> My son has severe ezczema on his hands and this has been very helpful in clearing and preventing further breakfood.  It doesn&#x27;t get as lathery as regular pumped soaps but it does clean well and does not leave a film.</li>
            <li> Mild and non-allergenic.  It is not inexpensive.  I don&#x27;t really have much more to say about it.  That&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> After two years of frustration, trying to figure out why my skin broke out in small rashes, I stopped using OTC liquid soaps and started using Free &amp; Clear liquid soap and shampoo. In two days I was rash free and remain after months of use. If you suffer from skin rashes, give this a try. It worked like a miracle for me.</li>
            <li> so hard to find fragrence free, unscented products.....this ticks the boxes on that one - I use it as hand soap and it works great</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist after treatment for sun damage.  I had a severe case of contact dermatitis and this product help clear it up by not introducing chemicals that irritated the new skin.</li>
            <li> For all of us who have sensitivities and allergies to soaps and fragrances, good news.  I tried this stuff at our allergists office and WOW my hands didn&#x27;t itch, dry out or hurt afterwards!!  I keep a small bottle in my purse now!  This product is amazing!!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I cannot use any other it is so easy to use and makes my  face feel clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> I had read about this product an decided to try it.  I recomend it to anyone with sensitive skin.  I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> The cleanser pump was open and some cleanser had been leaked allover the box and the other products :(</li>
            <li> This cleanser does a great job and leaves my skin clean and feeling smooth. I have very sensitive skin and have not used a cleanser that is more gentle. It is also a great value!</li>
            <li> My favorite face wash.. It cleans my face perfectly without leaving it dry it removes my makeup also perfectly..(i don&#x27;t use waterproof makeup) I gave it a 4 star because the pump doesn&#x27;t work....!!!!! So yes keep that in mind, not sire if it was only mine tho.. But totally recommend.</li>
            <li> Gentle, but still break out.</li>
            <li> I used to use perricone, lancome and others. My dermatologist recommend me this product. At first I was  skeptical but once I use WOW is the word. It is wonderful buy it BUY it!! very natural clean, after this I only use moisturizer and that&#x27;s it. so glad I got it</li>
            <li> Item is moslty used by my wife, she has very sensitive skin and it starts to crack if using regular washes, even some of the gentler ones. she has been using this for a while and finds that it is the best wash that she has used so far.</li>
            <li> Not only is there no perfume smell, the smell of the cleanser itself is mild and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great on face. For me it&#x27;s too drying on the scalp when attempting to use as a shampoo.</li>
            <li> I use it daily!! It really works well. It has a nice lather and my skin does not get irritated at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a cleanser for my 2y old with eczema. This foams up really well and is very gentle on the skin. I&#x27;m pregnant with my third right now and can&#x27;t use my normal facial cleanser thanks to certain ingredients so I&#x27;ve been using this on my face as well and it doesn&#x27;t leave my face red and splotchy like other products. All around great wash.</li>
            <li> This stuff really seems to work!  At daycare my son was coming home with very dry patches on his hands due to all the washing.  But his skin has stayed soft with this soap after a week of washing.</li>
            <li> Not to get too incredibly graphic here but if you have sensitive girly area&#x27;s this is THEE best thing i have ever used. Being a woman is sometimes like having a chemistry set attached to your body and can be a real pain. This stuff makes life so much easier. Thanks free and clear! Now I can run down the beach with my boyfriend holding hands or something.... ;)  Seriously. The best.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended I use this cleanser, along with a retinoid and a good moisturizer. It is unscented, has a good lather, and it cleans well, including removing most of my eyeshadow. Doesn&#x27;t do great at removing waterproof eye makeup. I will definately purchase again when my first bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> This is a great soap for sensitive hands. Does not leave your skin extra dry and so keeps the moisture intact.</li>
            <li> Have very sensitive skin - this is the only product that cleans pores without harshness. I have combination oily/dry skin - mostly dry. Don&#x27;t need to use a toner after this. Have been using it for a couple of years - got started with my allergist&#x27;s sample.  This 8 oz bottle lasts a very long time!&lt;br /&gt;( I do use organic coconut oil on my face too - at night and in the am unless I need the Vanicream sun screen first thing in the morning - live in FL)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the combination really works well.&lt;br /&gt;I use other Vanicream products too - wonderful line.</li>
            <li> Very good face wash. Have been using it for a few years.</li>
            <li> Gentle. Thorough. Does not dry skin.</li>
            <li> Love what it doesn&#x27;t have in it! My daughter has many allergies and will get red rashes and hives from some cleansers.  This is very gentle and haven&#x27;t had this problem with this product.  Have used it for several years now.</li>
            <li> Decided I would try this due to my allergies, asthma, eczema and sensitive skin. After using it to wash my hands, my skin was so dried out. My throat began to close, chest tighten and I had to take benadryl and albuterol to stop my reaction. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this, but I guess the chemicals were a no-no for me.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST product for cleaning your skin. There is no scent and it will leave you clean without ruining your skin. My son who has had blemish problems, gave up using name brand products and used this instead, and his skin is better than ever! Harsh is damaging to ALL skin types. This was recommended to me by a dermatologist I saw after I had a severe skin allergy. I&#x27;ve been using these products ever since. These may be a little more expensive than regular soaps, but for what you&#x27;re getting, and even more important, for what you&#x27;re NOT GETTING, they are very affordable. They last a long time and although they don&#x27;t lather as well as a few reviewers have written, that doesn&#x27;t make them bad, it actually means they&#x27;re better! Lather occurs more frequently when a product is alkaline, which is not as good for skin. A Ph balanced product tends to lather less, but still cleans as well. This cleanser can even be used for babies and is recommended by many pediatricians and dermatologists.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is so wonderful and simple. I wish they sold it at the regular drugstore. Nothing else compares! Gentle lather and doesn&#x27;t leave my sensitive oily combo acne skin irritated or dried out. I have also used it as a body wash!</li>
            <li> I recently found out I am allergic to a very common biocide found in many liquid cleansers (laundry detergent, dish detergent, hand soap, body wash, shampoo, etc) I ordered this and am VERY happy with it.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t that great. Equal quality to stuff u can find in the store for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who has skin allergies.  He uses this as a hand soap in the bathroom and kitchen.  It lathers nice and doesn&#x27;t dry out his hands.</li>
            <li> Works great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Did nothing to soothe the outbreak on my face but was effective for oily skin to combat the humidity of the DC summer.</li>
            <li> My teenager uses free and clear for cleansing her face, works great for her skin, keeps it clean from breaking out.</li>
            <li> Nice product, no detectable fragrance.  Suds up nicely.  Does not leave residue and does not make my skin itch.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. It isn&#x27;t too foamy and it does leave the skin softer but. it is a very small size for the price! Will not be reordering!</li>
            <li> I have very very SUPER sensitive skin. I do not have any breakouts. My skin feels clean after use. If you like Vanicream products you will love this.</li>
            <li> Very nice soap. Frangrance free too. Does not bother our allergies. Makes a nice lather. We buy this soap often.</li>
            <li> Seems to larger well and gets you clean. I bought for my daughter with allergies to use and she hasn&#x27;t seemed to have any troubles although her skin hasn&#x27;t gotten any better which we hoped for.</li>
            <li> Free and Clear certainly is what it promotes--it is a great cleanser for anyone who has any sensitivities, be they to harsh chemicals or to overpowering scents. It washes well, there&#x27;s no offensive scent and it leaves the skin smooth. I have only used it on my face, so this is what I&#x27;m basing my review on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t give it five stars because I don&#x27;t notice any great improvement to my skin. However, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and it doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling tight after washing, so it has been a good cleanser to use.</li>
            <li> After realizing that the mysterious &amp;#34;parfum&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; was the common factor in all of the products that caused irritation to my face and scalp, stumbling upon this affordable fragrance-free product was so relieving. I love this stuff. Don&#x27;t ever put great smells above your health. &amp;#34;Fragrance&amp;#34; is considered a trade secret, which means corporations don&#x27;t have to disclose EXACTLY what they put in it. If you have acne or really dry skin, it never hurts to cut out sulfates and fragrance to see what could be contributing to your issues. I happily recommend this.</li>
            <li> I bought this after my allergist recommended it as I have very sensitive skin.  However, this product was too harsh on my skin. After one use, my skin was super dry and flaky.  Will not use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bought this same brand&#x27;s SPF 50, and that seems to be very good.</li>
            <li> Daughter has a fragrance allergy!  Love this hand soap!</li>
            <li> This soap is full of chemicals. Free and Clear of anything from nature.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very moisturizing but if you have normal to oily or acne prone skin you will appreciate its texture.  In a world full of over fragranced irritating body washes, this is one of the only options for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because my son has super sensitive eczema prone skin. I had previously seen good results with both the bar soap and shampoo from the same company, but this caused my son&#x27;s skin to itch as soon as I put it on him.  We ditched this, but still use the Vanicream bar soap and Free and Clear Shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap that I can find that doesn&#x27;t cause my eczema to flair.  Great product and great value.</li>
            <li> My sensitive skin had been breaking out recently and nothing seemed to be working to clear it up.  My dermatologist recommended that I switch to this gentle cleanser as part of my new routine.  My skin felt immediately better than it had from the harsher scrub that I had been previously using - my face has never felt dry or tight after using this product.  Additionally, it&#x27;s cheap and a little bit goes a long way.  I also find that it does a very good job of removing my make up (although I don&#x27;t usually wear a lot).  My only complaint is that when I left my first bottle in the shower, water must have been getting in through the cap somehow because I noticed the consistency had gotten significantly watered down.  So now I am always sure to just use it by the sink.</li>
            <li> The info seemed like it might be reasonable ingredients.  It is filled with chemicals and bad ingredients -- couldn&#x27;t use. Horrible.</li>
            <li> Really Fragrance-Free and it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free&amp;Clear and Vanicream products are perfect for me because I&#x27;m allergic to most fragrances. They have minimal ingredients, so fewer things to be allergic to. And they work well. I use the Hair Gel, Shampoo, Conditioner, Skin Cream, Lite Lotion, Vaniply Ointment, and Liquid Cleanser. All are great products and I am really grateful for the lack of perfumes, masking fragrances, and unneeded botanical ingredients that could cause allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Liquid Cleanser doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. It also works as a shampoo in a pinch.</li>
            <li> I love love love this soap for my excema-sensitive babies.  It is perfect and gentle for them and doesn&#x27;t cause any rashes or itching.</li>
            <li> It came in an orderly fashion, liked that packaging wasn&#x27;t damaged when I received it. I have eczema and I like to use products that are alcohol, parfum, dyes and etc free. It doesn&#x27;t worsen my eczema, and it doesn&#x27;t cause any redness. So all in all a good body wash esp people with sensitivities. Hopefully this helps</li>
            <li> I have alot of skin issues and this product works very well.  It has no smell, but cleans very gently.  i would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Free and Clear is a great product that I have been using for over two years. I got tired of washing and ending up smelling like some chemist&#x27;s idea of a flower, often in an overpowering manner.  I use this soap at the bathroom sink and in the shower (and I confess as a shampoo)and it really does the job.</li>
            <li> Our granddaughter has eczema and this is the first cleanser that doesn&#x27;t burn her skin.  Great find.  Too bad it&#x27;s not in stores.</li>
            <li> I searched for a soap that would help with my daughters eczema and didn&#x27;t have anything that could irritate her skin allergies more. This soap is perfect! It doesn&#x27;t dry out or irritate her skin at all. It also lathers well and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Very good, non drying.  The bottle lasts a long time and is free of perfumes and chemicals.  If you have sensitive skin, this is superior to Phisoderm.  I have heard from others that they found this to be too drying for their skin, in which case I would recommend using along with Complex15 facial creme (which is now best ordered overseas or from eBay as it is no longer available at a reasonable price here in the states.  Note what it is now being sold for here at Amazon.  Still about $8 on eBay and Canadian pharmacy websites).</li>
            <li> I found this company and their products while at Mayo Clinics in Rochester MN. I have very sensitive reactive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have used the lotion for years and like it especially in summer&lt;br /&gt;I just bought this cleanser instead of my usual Whole Foods purchases. I find many Health Food Products contain too many herb and flower extracts. I have to avoid citric acid and salicylic acid as I break out in excema with them. I  try to avoid parabens.&lt;br /&gt;I use La Roche Posey products for my super sensitive face and this on my body.&lt;br /&gt;My only reason for 4 stars: small bottle, large amount of product it takes esp if using a wash cloth and minimal lathering. My well water is currently very soft and this barely lathers. If you like it be sure to look at the 32 oz refill bottles.&lt;br /&gt;I will try something else next time.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cleanser that didn&#x27;t contain any medicines. Cleanses nicely and washes away without leaving any film on my face.</li>
            <li> Good chemical-free body wash.</li>
            <li> For those with oily/ sensitive skin I have a pretty good regimen!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Steam face with a hot washcloth a few times&lt;br /&gt;2. Use african black soap on face + neck (a few times a week)&lt;br /&gt;3. Squeeze half a pump of Free and Clear, lather nicely all over face for 30 seconds then rinse&lt;br /&gt;4. Squeeze another half a pump of Free and Clear and lather, this time rinse with ice cold water to close those pesky large pores&lt;br /&gt;5. Use an oil minimizing toner such as Olay on face + neck&lt;br /&gt;6. Use 100% lemon extract all over your face to minimize pores, brighten skin and get rid of unsightly scars nightly (Stings like crazy on sensitive skin, but your skin will glow when you wake up the next morning)&lt;br /&gt;7. Use a NATURAL face lotion such as North American Hemp Co to balance your skin&#x27;s pH and moisturize&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has got my skin looking amazing and I hope it can help someone else too!</li>
            <li> My 3 year old son has battled with mild to moderate eczema for nearly 2 years.  I was using the Vanicream lotion on him, and it helped, but didn&#x27;t quite clear it all the way.  I didn&#x27;t know they had a matching cleanser until my son&#x27;s dermatologist told me about it. I am happy to say that he hasn&#x27;t had a flare up since a few days after we started using this.  We were using a steroid cream almost daily for nearly a year.  I haven&#x27;t had to apply it once in 2 weeks. :)  I also have dry, sensitive skin. I was curious and started using it myself and really like the results! I&#x27;m stocking up.</li>
            <li> Love their products!&lt;br /&gt;This company is in Rochester , MN home of the Mayo Clinic.&lt;br /&gt;This is a very good product you can feel good about using.</li>
            <li> excellent for the face and neck. No irritation. No fragrance to smell or to cause allergy. skin is soft after usage.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the scent too much, even though it is unscented.&lt;br /&gt;Not a scent of flowers or fruits, but a kind of masking odor which I do not like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does clean well, though. Almost too much lather when washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind it too much but out of the three brands I tried this one is my least favorite.</li>
            <li> I like this and I&#x27;m not switching to anything else for a while. The liquid is so light it feels almost like water on your skin. This is exactly what I was looking for. It doesn&#x27;t not dry out my skin and yet makes it feel clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My daughters have extreme eczema and this works great for them... Gets them clean without breaking them out.</li>
            <li> I AM GIVING THIS A HIGHER RATING THAN USUAL BECAUSE IT DOES A GREAT JOB AT CLEANSING AND NO HEAVY MASKING PARFUMES. GENTLE TO THE SKIN.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It&#x27;s gentle so I can use it on my face and body. And like with all vanicream products a little goes a long way! Great for people with eczema or sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Clear dispensing face/body wash without all the harsh chemicals...it might be making my face react but that is typically when switching products.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  I use it as a face wash.  My face is feeling softer and cleaner every time I use it.  I think the lack of harsh chemicals really is making a difference for me.  I really love it!  I thought I needed a daily scrub to get everything clean, but this very gentle cleanser does that for me and does it way better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  Try it!</li>
            <li> I had to start using liquid cleanser due to eczema. I had been using a scented liquid cleanser that I loved and had to give it up. Free &amp; Clear Liquid Cleanser is now cleanser of choice. You do not have to much. I plan on using this for a long time.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both have sensitive skin.  This is great for frequent use without causing excessive dryness or irritation.  Love that it is refillable at a fairly reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Even Johnson and Johnson baby products were irritating our preemies&#x27; skin, so we made the switch. This cleanser is a good value, works well, doesn&#x27;t dry out their skin and has caused no irritation.</li>
            <li> We chose this product because it is formaldehyde and scent free -- that says it all for us.  Like it.</li>
            <li> Reall nice, lots of suds, doesn&#x27;t seem to strip skin though</li>
            <li> As a new mother, I am washing my hands all the time. My eczema flared up after having the baby, and with the frequent hand washing, it caused really severe cracking. I now stock dispensers &amp; refills of this soap all over the house - while I still have eczema, this prevents it from getting bad. If I use regular hand soap with fragrances, my hands dry out super quickly. This prevents the flareups from getting worse.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and my face had been red and swollen and dry and peeling and weeping for the last several years.  I&#x27;ve been to numerous doctors, from dermatologists to naturopaths to integrative medicine MD to environmental medicine MDs for cure, but to no avail.  It was awful.  I could hardly open my eyes, and my whole face was burning and hurting and itching 24/7 without a break (not to mention embarrassment).  To control it, doctors gave me prednisone taper protocol, starting with 50mg.  It damaged my bones terribly, and I got moon face from it, my candida flared up, my immune system screwed up, and I couldn&#x27;t sleep because of the prednisone.  It was a 24/7 torture chamber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I finally went to another dermatologist, and after one look at it, he said it was contact dermatitis.  I didn&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d run into to flare up like this.  I had always thought it was food allergy, because every time I eat something wrong, my face gets worse.  I never thought it was contact dermatitis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then he said we needed to do a skin patch test for all the industrial ingredients which are in the lotion, soap, whatever else I was using.  But I was still on prednisone,which would mess up the results.  And it&#x27;s not something you can quit cold turkey.  I couldn&#x27;t do the patch test.  So I went home thinking, which one of the facial products would be the culprit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to stop using this Free and Clear cleanser first.  And lo and behold, after two weeks, my face cleared up!!!!!!!!!  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  After all these years of Elephant man face, I&#x27;m back to my own skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have Free and Clear shampoo too, along with Nutragena&#x27;s T-sals and Head and Shoulder for sensitive skin, which I use alternately.  Now that I found out this fact about the cleanser, I watched carefully, and I realized that every time I used the Free and Clear shampoo, my forehead would swell up and gets itchy.  So, I guess I am allergic to this company&#x27;s products.  I wish I knew earlier.  I have suffered so much, and damaged my body by using prednisone, hydrocortisone and other harmful drugs to control the flareups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the doctor, I flared up from eating wrong foods, because I was ALREADY inflamed from the facial product (meaning this stupid cleanser).  Anything would trigger the flareups when inflamed this much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I stopped using this product, I am less reactive to foods now.  I can eat just about anything and it doesn&#x27;t bother me much.  It has been nightmarish 5 years.  And I can&#x27;t believe not one of the doctors could help me, until I found this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, those who have similar breakouts and flareups, please think twice and take a break from whatever you&#x27;re using.  The product you&#x27;re using may be the cause of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope my comments will help some of the sufferers.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
            <li> the best cleanser i have used. foams up nicely, rinses nicely, cleans nicely. i proceeded to buy the 32 oz refill. great for sensitive skin and use before topical treatments and vanicream.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cleanser for his sensitive skin. Just bought it in the bigger refill size which is awesome!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a handy ready to use anywhere dispenser</li>
            <li> love this! Works well</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this soap for my husband and me.  We now use the entire line of skin care products.</li>
            <li> this is a great option for kids who have sensitive skin, especially on their hands. No fragrance and no soapy mess left on hands if not rinsed completely.</li>
            <li> My child has severe active eczema, allergies, and asthma.  This is the only product he can use that doesn&#x27;t make him itch!  Thanks for selling as describes!</li>
            <li> my skin breaks out at the hint of any excess chemical in a product I use on my skin. combine that with middle age, and now I battle break outs AND dry skin. This soap does well to keep the hives/rashes at bay from allergic reactions to chemicals, however I have to also combine it with Vanicream lotion because this soap does nothing to assist with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with how this product left my skin and did not cause any reactions/redness.  I like the minimal additives and it seemed to do the job!  I used it in pregnancy as recommended by my derm.</li>
            <li> Have been using Free and Clear shampoo and conditioner so thought I&#x27;d try this. Didn&#x27;t disappoint me. Smells great too!</li>
            <li> This product is suppose to be for sensitive skin but it irritated my skin @ was too drying. This may be good for other people but not for me.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser for my face. It cleanses the face and leaves it refreshed, not dry and dull looking.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive combination skin and this stuff does the trick. Cleanses well without drying out my skin. I like this better than cetaphil (my previous tried and true) because i like the lathering. The shampoo version not so good (dries out my hair and scalp).</li>
            <li> helps to keep my eczema in check but a little pricey</li>
            <li> I have to use alot of it to have lather, so I dont know how good it is yet.  Noticed that my skin is really dry since using it.  Will continue to see if it&#x27;s this or the weather.</li>
            <li> This product is great for sensitive facial skin.  It has no fragrance, does not burn, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> As I reviewed the refill version of this cleanser (which I returned), I thought I should post the same review here, since most would start with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was intrigued when I first found this product line, but in actual practice the cleanser barely does the job. Takes a generous amount just to start a lather (using a natural sea sponge) but fails to keep it going. For this price I&#x27;d expect a lot more. I won&#x27;t argue with the sensitivity issues, which more people may need than I did (I just naturally prefer fewer chemicals). Still, I would hope for more lathering and cleaning action from even a generous amount of product.</li>
            <li> For anyone suffering with Eczema or Atopic Eczema this product&lt;br /&gt;is the most &amp;#34;FREE AND CLEAR&amp;#34; that I have been able to locate.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using Free &amp; Clear for 10 years and I find it to be an exceptionally good product.  It is manufactured by Pharmaceutical Specialties, the same company that makes Vanicream products.  What makes Free &amp; Clear a superior product compared to most hand cleansers is that it does not include any fragrances, dyes, lanolin, parabens or other potentially irritating ingredients.  Less is definitely more when it comes to your skin, especially if you suffer with sensitivities.  Free &amp; Clear cleans the hands thoroughly without drying.  For the face, I prefer Vanicream products.  For the hands Free &amp; Clear cannot be beat.</li>
            <li> My doctor prescribed this cleanser for my eczema.  It&#x27;s not that easy to find but I have it on auto ship with Amazon and it is so convenient.  As for the cleanser - it works really well.</li>
            <li> Awesome products.  I have eczema and psoriasis and it does not irritate me at all</li>
            <li> Use it all the time, is one of the few soaps I can use for psoriasis &amp; not have any reaction, and I have tried many hand soaps. The plus side of this is the pump dispenser, I have one at each sink in my home. Purchasing the larger refill container cuts down on costs and just refill the smaller dispensers. Will continue to buy from Amazon as long as they keep offering the best prices!</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser! Not only does it remove everything, including ALL my eye makeup (even mascara) - it&#x27;s gentle, doesn&#x27;t sting, and suds up easily. This cleanser would be great for all skins. I have normal skin and just love it. I have used it w/ both my Clarisonic and now my Foreo Luna.</li>
            <li> My son has a lot of skin problems, and I am always looking for free &amp; clear type items. I have used this brand&#x27;s hair gel for my infant (you hear that right!) and it was great. We now all use this soap, it is definitely clear and scent-free, no skin causing problems, and it does feel like it&#x27;s cleaning you (which was the biggest concern). Good product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this item for more than a year and I&#x27;m very happy with this SKU.  It helps my breakouts.  My skin is getting better and better.  I used to spend so much money on those Japanese brands now I can only save more money but also get better skin.</li>
            <li> I use this for my 6 month old who has eczema. Wonderful product without all the junk in other soaps. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I have many sensitivities and have had a hard time finding products I can use. For me it&#x27;s not just &amp;#34;scents&amp;#34; that I am sensitive to it&#x27;s also the chemical compositions of things...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say this doesn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; per say but it does have a smell - I would describe it as what a lemon or orange  might smell like if you stripped away the fragrance...acid like...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t that I didn&#x27;t like the smell, it&#x27;s not pleasant but it&#x27;s not awful either, it is that this soap and the hair care products from this line gave me massive headaches when used.</li>
            <li> My sister is allergic to products with any kind of fragrance so I got this at her request because she can use it without a problem.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to most shampoos and cleansers as they contain detergent like chemicals, as in sulfates.  Funny that I have no problems with a lot of OTC moisturizers.  I am also allergic to Cetaphil cleanser as well (have been patch tested for everything).  This is one of the few cleansers so far that I can use with no reaction.  Right now I am also using for wash at night is Neutrogena&#x27;s Naturals with willowbark. So far so good....but with onset of menopause who knows what&#x27;s next!!</li>
            <li> As a chemically sensitive individual, this is the only soap on the market that my body tolerates. I would be &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; without it. It is a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin. I do, however, like to feel moisturized when I&#x27;ve showered,  but everything else makes me itch or get hives. This doesn&#x27;t!  I use it on my fave &amp; body &amp; no more hives or skin issues</li>
            <li> If you have been searching for something without harsh chemicals and junk that you can not pronounce then this will be up your alley. I have tried it all from drugstore to fancy department store brands. Save your money and time ----go ahead and get this along with the refill bottle. It&#x27;s super gentle for the most sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I think this entire brand is amazing for sensitive skin.  I love love the ointment, cream and &amp;#34;lite&amp;#34; lotion.  The only thing is that I don&#x27;t love is this face/body wash.  I prefer Sebamed Face and Body Wash, which is much gentler on my skin.</li>
            <li> seems to be as advertised.</li>
            <li> Pure, non stinging, and neutral in the drying arena - I like it.  I don&#x27;t have dry skin, but I do have older skin so I wanted something that gets off my makeup without drying out my face.  This is neutral that way.  Not moisturizing and not drying either.  It&#x27;s just fine and priced well.  Truth be told, I would have liked a little bit more of a moisturized feel, but it&#x27;s ok just as it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the refill AND a pump bottle at the same time based on a trial sample I ordered from the manufacturer and other reviews at a makeup site.  I think I did well.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist to causing minimal irritation to my skin. It is difficult to find cleansers without deleterious additives in any stores that I shop.</li>
            <li> It saved my sons live who always had dry skin and sensitive skin it was recommended by our doctor .Thanks</li>
            <li> This is a great face wash for sensitive skin! I use it in the shower every morning on my face and my skin doesn&#x27;t get red and stripped like with other face washes. It lathers just enough and rinses cleanly without any residue. I use the Vanicream Lite Lotion on my face after washing, and the Moisturizing Skin Cream at night. I&#x27;d recommend any of the Vanicream products for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Can I say, I absolutely love this soap.  It is amazing.  Especially for someone with allergies and sensitive skin.  If you need something that you wont be allergic to or you do not want all the nasty chemicals, defiantly choose this one.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin. Also using Retin A. So I need an extremely gentle facial cleanser. Very gentle. My daughter with eczema also uses this as a body wash.</li>
            <li> Great face/hand/body wash for those of us with sensitive skin. Works well if you are on Retin-A.</li>
            <li> Cleans and rinses well. It is a thin liquid type cleanser. I appreciate this as I am gentle with my face and the last thing I want to do is scrub and scrub to wash my cleanser off of my face.1 pump of this cleanser is all I need to gently wash my entire face. Very good product!</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist because I have very sensitive skin. Free and Clear works great, cleans and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my 87 year old mother, it&#x27;s the only cleanser that does not irritate her eyes. She loves it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this about a month ago.  I&#x27;ll start by saying I have really normal skin, a little oily in the T-zone.  But I&#x27;ve rarely had problems with any face soap, and I&#x27;ve never had facial skin issues.  I was looking for a facial soap alternative that didn&#x27;t have a bunch of scents and dyes.  I like it so far.  You don&#x27;t have to use much, it gives a good lather, and rinses clean.  It is a bit drying, but I follow it up with toner and a coconut-water based moisturizer.  I got it in my eyes once and it stung really badly - I&#x27;ve learned not to do that.  All in all, a good cleanser for a really good price.</li>
            <li> My husband has extremely sensitive skin and can&#x27;t tolerate any fragrance in products that touch his skin. This soap is on his bathroom vanity and has helped his hands. Yes, it&#x27;s more than your average hand soap but his comfort and healthy skin are worth the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I suffer from eczema and I cannot use items with scent, which everything I find at the store contains fragrance. I use it after playing with my dogs, when my hands tend to really itch. This wash immediately took away the pet dander and there was no itch. It lathered well and did the job! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve worked for a number of cosmetic/ skin care companies over the years, and tried just about everything. I have combination skin that is also sensitive. This is by far the BEST face cleanser I have found. The others either leave my skin too tight feeling, or too moisturized where it still feels like there is cleanser on it- this one is perfect. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and my skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years!! For those reviewers that say it&#x27;s too drying... how about using a moisturizer afterward??? After all, cleansers are meant to cleanse, to remove oil, dirt and makeup. If you want a great cleanser, this one does the job perfectly!! I also like to use the cleanser with a wash cloth to get all the dead skin off my face as well. I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> Recommended to me by my dermatologist and it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  Cleans your skin yet doesn&#x27;t dry it and Is free of perfumes and alot of other ingredients that cause allergies.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for anyone suffering from eczema. They also have shampoo &amp; conditioner.  Add some Vanicream to.</li>
            <li> This liquid cleanser is very effective in cleaning water soluble substances and more free of unnecessary or undesirable substances than any other I know about.  I use it to preserve the health of my skin and to clean the brushes I use to do art work while avoiding the accidental introduction of impurities into my art work after cleaning brushes.</li>
            <li> My four year old daughter has extremely sensitive skin. She was having rash after rash and other odd skin conditions until the dermatologist suggested this brand for all her cleanser, shampoo, conditioner, ect.  This cleanser works great and does not irritate the skin.  We  use for general hand washing and for bath time with ease.  My daughter doesn&#x27;t love the same, mainly because there isn&#x27;t one.  But it&#x27;s a great product and would recommend.</li>
            <li> Like some of the other reviewers, I do find it a little drying. My skin is very sensitive and does not react kindly to cleansers of any kind. I appreciate that it is fragrance and sulfate free and I have not had any major breakouts since using this cleanser so for those reasons I give it four stars, if it was more moisturizing I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Recently diagnosed with Eczema, I&#x27;ve been on a non-stop mission to find &#x27;all things non-irrating&#x27; to replace all my personal and household products which aggravate my eczema. This said it&#x27;s suitable for &amp;#34;hands, face and body&amp;#34;, and is free of a whole bunch of common irritants and is fragrance-free so I gave it a try. I bought one for my bathroom sink and one for the kitchen sink, and will probably add it to my shower too if I can&#x27;t find a suitable body wash. It makes my hands feel nice and clean: not stripped but not moisturized from extra crap, just CLEAN. I almost forgot what plain ol&#x27; clean feels like because most hand soaps have added garbage that moisturize, exfoliate, etc. This does nothing fancy, it just gives you an honest, simple clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed my face with it and I always have to moisturize immediately afterward because my skin is very dry, but just for the sake of testing this product, I didn&#x27;t moisturize right away. My skin didn&#x27;t have that tight and itchy feeling, which was refreshing indeed. I do still need to moisturize my face, but my test showed that it&#x27;s at least not harsh in any way. It has a nice lather, semi-low lathering but still enough to satisfy the senses and feels silky in the hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the price. These are small bottles. There is a larger refill bottle but I still feel it&#x27;s a bit on the pricey side in my opinion. I will continue to buy it, but like I said above, if I can find a less expensive eczema-friendly product for body wash I will, and reserve this for face and hands. On the plus side, a little goes a long way, I only need a very small amount for hand washing, not a full pump - maybe not even half a pump, so that helps take the some of the sting out of the price. Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this so far and I think my poor, irritated skin will thank me.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for babies or kids with sensitive skin. My son has had small eczema patches here and there on his body since he was born and his skin was sensitive overall. My doctor recommended this brand and I love it! It doesn&#x27;t contain any harmful chemicals. Used it for about 4 years until my son grew out the eczema.</li>
            <li> I always use this product after I clean my make up with a makeup remover. My skin feels very soft and clean and I do not have to worry about my skin getting exposed by some BS chemicals.</li>
            <li> The product inside the bottle is good. I like this soap. Problem is the dispense nozzle doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve bought about 5 of these and 3 haven&#x27;t dispensed at all. Have to open it up and pour it out every time. Good soap but probably not gonna buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, cleared up breakouts I had been experiencing,  super gentle and effective at removing all my makeup. Awesome product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several years now and it is very gentle on my face and doesn&#x27;t cause me to have breakouts.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser. After use it leaves your face clean feeling, not squeaky clean like some bars of soap, but a real nice clean. My face is not greasy afterwards either, no lotion feel.  It removes my make up well too. You only need a little too.  My only complaint is I can&#x27;t get all the liquid out with the pump.</li>
            <li> Nice lather, washes off clean. And yes it is unscented but unlike some other products this is very pleasing to my nose.</li>
            <li> Very good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have an allergy to fragrance and this is the perfect solution.</li>
            <li> Keep buying it due to natural qualities.  Seems to be from Vanicream Lotion company and keep getting it due to kids ecema and reduced significantly</li>
            <li> This cleanser is one of the best I have ever tried. It is light, foaming, fragance-free, gentle, leaves no residue, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. It is perfect for sensitive skin that tends to be combination or oily. There are so few cleansers targeted for this skin type, so I am very glad to have found this one after trying over 40 cleansers (ranging from drugstore to luxury-priced ones over $50). Definitely the one thing I have kept in my skincare routine all this time. I HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great product for overly sensitive skin.  Cleans very well without all of the drama of additives and perfumes.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Affordable, light and does the trick... Cleans my face &amp; controls breakouts! Repeat customer ...</li>
            <li> I found out I have an allergy to fragrance so bought several products without fragrance and I am happy with them all.</li>
            <li> Wow!  After trying what seemed like endless cleansers for my 12 year old&#x27;s facial eczema &amp; keratosis pilaris, it seems the search is finally over.  We are also dealing with the occasional pimple, &amp; I am pleased to say that this cleaner is uniquely cleansing yet moisturizing without leaving a residue, like Cetaphil seems to do.  It is still too early in the year to tell if this will limit the severity of the eczema (worsens during the winter),  but for now this has dramatically improved the texture and condition of a persistent parch of eczema near his mouth, as well as made the persistent keratosis pilaris bumps on his cheeks disappear.  Definitely worth the $$- I ended up buying the refill bottle after seeing these results in 2 days!&lt;br /&gt;1/21/13 update:  Ugh, with this cold spell, it looks like my son&#x27;s eczema is flaring up once again, despite the use of this cleanser &amp; jojoba oil.  I wasn&#x27;t naive enough to think that this cleanser would ward off all flare-ups, but I&#x27;m just disappointed that he&#x27;s still so prone to eczema, if it gets cold &amp; dry enough, he&#x27;ll just end up with at least a little patch.  We are still enjoying this cleanser, &amp; it&#x27;s worth a repurchase for me, but it&#x27;s no miracle (nothing is :) ).</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD FOR EXTREMELY SENSITIVE SKIN, ESP. PEOPLE GOING THRU CHEMO OR WITH MEDICAL PROBLEMS</li>
            <li> Excellent for Rosacea, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t dry my already flaky skin out like the fragrance bodywash and soaps. I wish it was a bigger bottle for the price though.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, I think any body wash would do what this did.</li>
            <li> Great product.....not harmful...free from anything we think we need and cleans deeply with out irritating!!  my skin loves these products!!</li>
