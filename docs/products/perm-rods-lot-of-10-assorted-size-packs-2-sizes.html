            <li>Just wonderful the items arrive on time</li>
            <li>The price was great and the rod size variety was great.</li>
            <li>I ended up returning them but customer service was great.</li>
            <li>Great; just like being at the salon</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with my purchase</li>
            <li>so I was very happy I was able to find these on Amazaon.  </li>
            <li>They all look to be in good shape.  </li>
            <li>These are good quality.</li>
            <li>I like to perm my own hair as I have never been please with the results when I go to a salon.  </li>
            <li>if you were perming someone else&#x27;s hair but do not recommend if you are perming your own hair.</li>
            <li>There nice perm rods and have the elastic band to hold them in place</li>
            <li>and it is a nice assortment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Undoubtedly would be okay</li>
            <li>Received rollers in a timely manner &amp; they were packaged appropriately.  </li>
            <li>pleased to have found and purchased them.  </li>
            <li>The white ones are perfect.</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>But I have enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure they will do the job,  </li>
            <li>This seems like a good deal when you really don&#x27;t know what size perm roller to get.  </li>
            <li>it was more than I expected I am so happy with my purchase</li>
            <li>Love the rods I have natural fine hair</li>
            <li>More challenging to wrap and secure than expected.</li>
            <li>but well worth it..</li>
            <li>you can  get a better deal at your local BBS store</li>
            <li>but I can tell just by looking at them that they are exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>, the only thing I would have liked was the rods to be smooth as sometimes the rough body can hold on to the hair, but it did not burst up my hair though.</li>
            <li>the picture is deceiving the only ones you can really use are the light peach ones</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used these for a perm yet, but I got them really fast</li>
            <li>Also, using various size rollers in your perm will give it a more natural look.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I used these for years and mine finally bit the dust.  They were hard to find but well worth it..</li>
            <li> I received the perm rollers. They all look to be in good shape.  This seems like a good deal when you really don&#x27;t know what size perm roller to get.  Also, using various size rollers in your perm will give it a more natural look.</li>
            <li> I like to perm my own hair as I have never been please with the results when I go to a salon.  Perm supplies are increasingly getting more difficult to find in stores so I was very happy I was able to find these on Amazaon.  The price was great and the rod size variety was great.</li>
            <li> Works just as it should. Its a perm rod what can I say? It holds my hair as it should.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to use them because they are too difficult to fasten.  Undoubtedly would be okay if you were perming someone else&#x27;s hair but do not recommend if you are perming your own hair.</li>
            <li> I have used these rods a lot.  I change up the size rods I use depending upon how long my hair is, what style I want, how curly, etc..  They have held up well with lots of use.</li>
            <li> There nice perm rods and have the elastic band to hold them in place well. The perm rollers were just smaller than I thought they would be.</li>
            <li> I expected them to be like the ones I bought in the hair store but they are not. The quality is not the same, but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Received rollers in a timely manner &amp; they were packaged appropriately.  Never expected them to be the small size.  I wish I had known that prior to purchasing.  These were the size used for Jheri-curls. I ended up returning them but customer service was great. So no complaints except for the size.</li>
            <li> These are good quality. Have had them for over 6 months now and I haven&#x27;t used up to half of the perm rods.</li>
            <li> All the rods are small small and smaller the picture is deceiving the only ones you can really use are the light peach ones and you only get 12 of those you can  get a better deal at your local BBS store i found them cheaper no sure what i was thinking PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> Just wonderful the items arrive on time it was more than I expected I am so happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used these for a perm yet, but I got them really fast and it is a nice assortment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very  pleased to have found and purchased them.  They seem to be getting hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> Great; just like being at the salon</li>
            <li> Love the rods I have natural fine hair and they work well, the only thing I would have liked was the rods to be smooth as sometimes the rough body can hold on to the hair, but it did not burst up my hair though. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> More challenging to wrap and secure than expected.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used these rods yet but I can tell just by looking at them that they are exactly what I wanted.</li>

            <li> I love the product. I only have one issue with it and that is the caps pop off or the bands come loose. But I have enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not able to use them fully as yet because my hair is still too short but I&#x27;m sure they will do the job,  they are not the originals but u get what u pay for.</li>
