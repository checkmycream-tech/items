            <li>Great case looks sexy on my Black Note 3.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for clear and yet still has a good grip to it.</li>
            <li>Even if it was too, I would definitely buy another one since it is also a good price.</li>
            <li>The problem with most clear phone cases is that they tend to be cheap looking or flimsy or unprotective.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Super inexpensive, and grippy.  </li>
            <li>Cheaply made, you get exactly what you pay for...nothing.</li>
            <li>I love clear phone cases</li>
            <li>it has a nice grip and actually protects the phone the phone.</li>
            <li>I love it because it is clear.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a must have for keeping it simple, showing off your device without concealing it, buying two, so you have a spare kind of case...</li>
            <li>The fit, this case fits perfectly and seems like its made out of high quality TPU, will update later on to let you know if the case turns yellow like cheap TPU clear</li>
            <li>The snug and slim fit, the case is not only perfectly made to fit the Note 3 but its also very slim, much slimmer than my previous dyztronic case.</li>
            <li>I bought this case because I really like the form factor of my Galaxy Note 3 and all the different cases hid the beautiful fauxleather on the back instead of showcasing</li>
            <li>To add extra protection though I added a glass screen protector and now feel very comfortable and don&#x27;t really worry at all if the phone takes a spill !</li>
            <li>It fits pretty snug.</li>
            <li>Very cheap material and is not tight enough on my phone.</li>
            <li>a button.&lt;br /&gt;Another thing to mention is that DIGIWAVES U.S.A. was really fast in shipping my product</li>
            <li>Give it a try you should be very content with this gel case.</li>
            <li>Very Inexpensive</li>
            <li>Just like the pictures, it is crystal clear!  </li>
            <li>this was my second time buying it because my dad took my first one.</li>
            <li>on the phone you get a blueish smoke color instead of clear.</li>
            <li>If they were to revise the case and fix the buttons I would give a complete 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how clear it was.</li>
            <li>, it only took three days to arrive, overall this case is a solid buy and for the price its well worth it.</li>
            <li>and I can insert different papers in the back of the phone to make it seem like a new case!</li>

            <li> /&gt;There are some negatives though, the Buttons have almost no feedback when pressed, only the power button feels clicky, the volume buttons have absolutely no feedback</li>

            <li> /&gt;*It is not a clear case</li>
            <li> not fit the phone</li>
            <li> so I just wanted the protection for the small scratches and scuffs.</li>
            <li> buttons on side hard to push</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re clumsy this case isn&#x27;t for you, get a shock proof</li>
            <li> Very thin is what I like as well so it won&#x27;t feel so bulky.</li>
            <li> Can you say LACK PROTECTION, omg this case sucks!!!!!!</li>

            <li> Cheap and nice. Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty nice case. With smaller drops it will help to protect the phone. I love the look of my note 3 and this case allows me to see the phone as well as give some protection. It fits pretty snug. To add extra protection though I added a glass screen protector and now feel very comfortable and don&#x27;t really worry at all if the phone takes a spill !</li>
            <li> it was perfect to showcase the beautiful design of my cellphone! Just what I was looking for.</li>

            <li> I got this for my wife&#x27;s note 3, and she likes it. I was surprised at how clear it was.</li>
            <li> This case don&#x27;t require any star. Cheaply made, you get exactly what you pay for...nothing. The Volume Buttons And The Power Bottoms DONT WORK With THIS case. Can you say LACK PROTECTION, omg this case sucks!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I do not recommended it turned yellowish in just 4 weeks. Very cheap material and is not tight enough on my phone.</li>
            <li> Great case looks sexy on my Black Note 3.  Most importantely it adds No Bulk!</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*Does not fit the phone snugly.&lt;br /&gt;*It is not a clear case&lt;br /&gt;*Once on the phone you get a blueish smoke color instead of clear. Makes case look dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contacted seller with pictures to prove what I was talking about and they told me I&#x27;d have to deal with it. It wasn&#x27;t their problem.</li>
            <li> I really like it!!!!!</li>
            <li> Nice but its slips off the phone to easy I do not think it will protect the phone well I wish it would grip the phone better but I do like the case.</li>
