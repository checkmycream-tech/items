            <li>but that didnt matter tge quility was fine</li>
            <li>good blend with my natural hair</li>
            <li>These clips really does come in handy for a quick fix for extensions.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth the wai!</li>
            <li>Great product, just took a long time to arrive.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used them on any weave tracks but they do feel pretty strong.</li>
            <li>My clips came in a cute blue baggy which I thought was an added bonus since I will be able to reuse it.</li>
            <li>They are sturdy, economical, looks just as depicted and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Although it took close to 4 weeks to receive, they were worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Great quality, only left four because the clips took a bit longer than thought,</li>
            <li>The order came very fast</li>
            <li>The clips are okay, thought they were gonna be bigger.</li>
            <li>so I really don&#x27;t know how to rate it.  </li>
            <li>The delivery was so fast as well.</li>
            <li>Shipping was estimated at 15 days or more but the package arrived faster than expected.</li>
            <li>I bought real hair extensions that had no clips because it saves so much $$ to do this way.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It arrived in a little less than three weeks and they have a super strong hold!</li>
            <li>Arrived early and the clips grips the hair tightly will order more in the near future.</li>
            <li>I got all 50 clips and they feel firm and secure.</li>
            <li>Wow it took a long time to get, but the price is absolutely unbeatable.</li>
            <li>which is a major plus!</li>
            <li>it came with exactly 50 clips and so far, I haven&#x27;t found any that were broken, so it was definitely worth the price and wait</li>
            <li>Order came faster then estimated apparently</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I expected to receive &amp; it was delivered a bit earlier than estimated.</li>
            <li>used with Remy Real Indian hair 22 inches and black thread</li>
            <li>The clips I got weren&#x27;t the clips shown (the were black, but they weren&#x27;t round, U-Shaped, which didn&#x27;t bother me much because I like the basic straight clips and that&#x27;s what I got).</li>

            <li> So far, the black paint hasn&#x27;t chipped either which is a plus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased, I ordered it on January 19th or 20th and got it yesterday in the mail (aside for the terrible snow storm, it was decent timing).</li>
            <li> so it took way to long</li>
            <li> They seem to hold tight and look just like the ones my local hair supply store is selling for $1 for each clip.</li>
            <li> i was hoping they would be a little bigger</li>
            <li> it was ok because she didn&#x27;t say nothing bad about them.</li>
            <li> They are just as described and they work as expected.</li>
            <li> Expected Date was May 18th through June 4th.</li>
            <li> clips were there with a few extra.</li>
            <li> Not too big, not too small.</li>
            <li> They are not too big, but they are also not too small.</li>
            <li> I sometimes wonder about customer comments as it seems as some of the negative comments that sometimes arise are from a totally different product than the one I received.</li>
            <li> If you have a sensitive scalp it might be irritating.</li>
            <li> They get a little use to wearing tho.</li>
            <li> Yes it takes a little longer to get them</li>
            <li> 3 star because they are heavy in your head.</li>
            <li> I received 50 and paid less than $4.00!</li>
            <li> A few were broken very hard to snap open</li>
            <li> If you never tried these you are missing out !</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t sew these on  because the holes on the end were to small.</li>
            <li> Dont have anything to say negative</li>
            <li> so I sort of had a forewarning, and if that&#x27;s the case, at least change the information for the product</li>
            <li> None were broken or damaged</li>
    </ol>

            <li> These clips really does come in handy for a quick fix for extensions. better than spending a fortune at a salon.</li>
            <li> Love love love and the price is awesome for the amount</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased, I ordered it on January 19th or 20th and got it yesterday in the mail (aside for the terrible snow storm, it was decent timing). BUT, #1. The clips I got weren&#x27;t the clips shown (the were black, but they weren&#x27;t round, U-Shaped, which didn&#x27;t bother me much because I like the basic straight clips and that&#x27;s what I got). #2. I only received 20, not 50. I noticed someone else said in the Reviews a while back that they weren&#x27;t doing 50 anymore so I sort of had a forewarning, and if that&#x27;s the case, at least change the information for the product so no one is misled. Aside from that, great product, reasonable timing, I&#x27;m happy :)</li>
            <li> Did not come with 50 pieces. Came with 6.</li>
            <li> Work well and easy to put on the track :-)</li>
            <li> This was great! It arrived in a little less than three weeks and they have a super strong hold! it came with exactly 50 clips and so far, I haven&#x27;t found any that were broken, so it was definitely worth the price and wait</li>
            <li> 3 star because they are heavy in your head.</li>
            <li> I have course, African-American hair and these clasps do a  great job. So far, the black paint hasn&#x27;t chipped either which is a plus. Great product. Great deal.</li>
            <li> i was hoping they would be a little bigger but i guess i liked them.</li>
            <li> Order came faster then estimated apparently it ships from china so I think they must estimate at longer period. I place my order on 5/30/13 and received on 6/7/13 . My clips came in a cute blue baggy which I thought was an added bonus since I will be able to reuse it. All50 clips were there with a few extra. Diffinately would order again and recommend</li>
            <li> Great quality and fast shipping. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Way better then the ones you get at sallys</li>
            <li> Love them/ very easy to use/ gently on the scalp!!/ will buy if needed again</li>
