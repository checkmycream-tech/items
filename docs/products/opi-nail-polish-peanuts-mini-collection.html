            <li>Fun.</li>

            <li>While the colors may not be a someones cup of tea, if you like a nice sunny yellow, black that applies without being patchy, and glitter</li>

            <li> My kids aren&#x27;t big peanuts&#x27; fans but my girls like the black and yellow nail polish.</li>
            <li> The only thing I had a problem with was the black polish.</li>
            <li> The yellow polish (which I bought this for) is gummy and hard to apply.</li>
            <li> I give 3 stars for the glitter polish and the black.</li>
            <li> This is a mini collection, not full size so be mindful of that</li>
            <li> I have trouble opening every time I use it.</li>
            <li> 4 small bottles of nail polish plus some a few nail stickers.  </li>
            <li> and I mean a FAN.  </li>
            <li> that is whimsical -not run of the mill-</li>

            <li> love it! I love the Peanuts gang and with the added decals made it even better!</li>
            <li> Peanuts and OPI nail polishes, my favorite things.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the mini size of nail polishes, same quality but the possibility to try colors that I wouldn&#x27;t buy in full size.</li>
            <li> When I received my order the box was all smashed.</li>
            <li> I give 3 stars for the glitter polish and the black. Delivery was fast. The yellow polish (which I bought this for) is gummy and hard to apply.</li>
            <li> Got it fast! Thanks &amp; I Love!!!</li>
            <li> Okay, I am a Peanuts fan and I mean a FAN.  I have had more fun with these colors and doing all kinds of peanuts related nail are with.  This is a mini collection, not full size so be mindful of that Still, it is a whole lot of fun to play with.</li>
            <li> Great for a &amp;#34;Peanuts&amp;#34; fan. 4 small bottles of nail polish plus some a few nail stickers.  My kids aren&#x27;t big peanuts&#x27; fans but my girls like the black and yellow nail polish. Fun.</li>
            <li> OPI is always a favorite, when meshed with Peanuts you can&#x27;t go wrong. I loved the decals that came with as an added bonus. :)</li>
            <li> OPI used to have notorious consistency issues with their mini bottles. Thankfully, it seems that they&#x27;ve learned from the past because my last couple purchases of mini sets have yielded great quality polishes that have applied as well as their full size counterparts. While the colors may not be a someones cup of tea, if you like a nice sunny yellow, black that applies without being patchy, and glitter that is whimsical -not run of the mill- go nuts and pick up this peanuts set!&lt;br /&gt;Great mini set!</li>
            <li> Gifts for teenage friends.</li>
            <li> Great colors, bought for a gift and she loved it.</li>
            <li> I love these!!! The colors are so great, as well as the glitter!! I love the combination, it is a great set that truely portraits Peanuts!</li>
