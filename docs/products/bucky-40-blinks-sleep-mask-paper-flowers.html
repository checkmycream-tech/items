            <li>I&#x27;m able to blink my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this sleep mask.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s also really cute.</li>
            <li>Cute colors plus very easy to fit and wear.  </li>
            <li>These are amazing, third pair we&#x27;ve bought and these are hella sexy!!</li>
            <li>It is so comfortable that I don&#x27;t even realize it&#x27;s there most of the time.  </li>
            <li>They block the light well.</li>
            <li>I wore it on the plane on an overnight flight and it was quite comfortable.  </li>
            <li>It blocks all light from creeping in.</li>
            <li>I use it almost daily for naps, great for travel.</li>
            <li>This mask is fantastic.</li>
            <li>it fits comfortably and does not smash my nose (</li>
            <li>Because it fits so well it blocks out all light</li>
            <li>Our bedroom filters light in the morning</li>
            <li>Keeps the light out without putting any pressure on your eyes.</li>
            <li>and  it doe keep all the light out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really comfortable and blocks out all the light.  </li>
            <li>We teasingly joked that this was the swim-top for my 18 pound American Eskimo dog, but it is a great sleep mask</li>
            <li>This eyeshade does what it&#x27;s supposed to - block out light and not press on my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>Work night shift and this mask reallyrics blocks the light.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a very light sleeper,  and they are so comfortable, adjustable, and really block the light.  </li>
            <li>The first lasted many years.</li>
            <li>This one is even lighter weight than the first, has even better shaping/conturing for the eye spaces &amp; nose, and is improved in the manufacturing.</li>
            <li>Plus all the pretty colors :-)</li>
            <li>My hopes were high for the Bucky 40 Blinks mask, as its design is almost perfect: comfortable and totally dark with huge comfortable pockets for your eyes.</li>
            <li>However, its made of a synthetic foam material that is non-absorbent and excellent at insulating - so expect to be woken up by pools of sweat where the mask (and thick elastic strap) comes in contact with your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>black!&lt;br /&gt;I also have to say that my NEW mask is even BETTER than the first!!</li>
            <li>Would love it more if it were actually the color that I ordered.  </li>
            <li>The first night I tried it, I was hooked!</li>
            <li>I had my first Bucky for 4 years until I wore it out - literally!</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
            <li>This is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Jillian</li>
            <li>Received one in my Christmas stocking, then bought these colorful sleep masks as gifts for a gals&#x27; getaway.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>The eyes can open under the mask but keeps light out great and the nose is totally free from any fabric coming down.</li>
            <li>The best part - total pitch dark!</li>
            <li>The first one lasted about 8 years before the elastic band was shot.</li>
            <li>I am terribly sensitive to light and without my Bucky Mask</li>
            <li>Before I ordered my first mask from this vendor, every morning, my eyes were all gunked up with the greasy ointment and a bunch of hair.</li>
            <li>This sleep mask is so light weight and soft against your face</li>
            <li>This eye mask is so soft, and has pockets over the eyes that are so comfortable that, if you&#x27;re anything like me, you&#x27;ll never sleep without this thing again.</li>
            <li>Love this eye mask; the only one I can wear - doesn&#x27;t bother your eyelashes with the way it bubbles out over the eyes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The sleep mask completely blocks out all light, allowing the wearer to enjoy a deep, undisturbed nights sleep.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a flight attendant and always keep one in my suitcase.</li>
            <li>The adjustable Velcro strap should make it work for anyone and if the extra Velcro is getting caught in your hair, wrap it with either a gauze or cloth band and secure it with a piece of paper or cloth tape.</li>
            <li>Totally block the light.</li>
            <li>I really like the Bucky sleep masks because they allow some eye movement when you have them on.  </li>
            <li>I have bought a ton of masks, these are the only ones that stay put all night and block 100% of light.</li>
            <li>This is the only sleep mask to buy- doesn&#x27;t press against your eyes and completely blocks the light!</li>
            <li>Very comfortable to wear, however, I haven&#x27;t used other types for comparison....</li>
            <li>first one I bought at TJ Maxx when I noticed it was contoured &amp; not like your &amp;#34;typical&amp;#34; flat sleeping masks that I&#x27;ve had in the past &amp; not been happy about.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The head strap is long and can easily be adjusted to make the fit as snug or as loose as you desire.&lt;br /&gt;Velcro</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without these!</li>
            <li>Well made - delivered on time - high quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>In addition to lack of breathability mentioned in other reviews, the velcro on the strap, when adjusted properly to secure the mask gently on my face, also sticks to my hair.  </li>
            <li>The mask doesn&#x27;t irritate the lashes and completely blocks the light as long as it&#x27;s positioned correctly.</li>
            <li>I also have been able to wash them when necessary and lie out to dry.</li>
            <li>but after 4 years of use, I guess it was time for a new one!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, it packs well, and is formed such that I an open my eyes comfortably and blink even though I&#x27;m wearing the mask.  </li>
            <li>These masks are very comfortable for REM sleep due to the deep wells</li>
            <li>I work night shift, and apparently I have super long eye lashes, because without the eye pockets, I wouldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>However, they keep all light out and don&#x27;t feel to tight on your head.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m almost certain you&#x27;ll feel the same way!</li>
            <li>Not as good as the mask I bought from this company a few years ago, just in that it&#x27;s bigger so doesn&#x27;t fit as well on my small face, and I&#x27;m not used to the way the mask doesn&#x27;t lay flat against my eyes but bulges out a bit.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t have needed a second one if our new fur-babies didn&#x27;t find my old one and use it as a tug toy.  </li>
            <li>They last a fairly long time so the price is amortized just about right.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t make me hot like other eye covers I have used.  </li>
            <li>I have had some other padded masks that seemed too hot.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Velcro back is secure and doesn&#x27;t hurt or get my hair caught in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allows very little light through (nose just a smudge because I have a small bridge).  </li>
            <li>It is much more rigid than previous ones and would not stay down on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back to order a couple of the new patterns because the one I&#x27;ve worn the past two years is just not as pretty as these new ones.</li>
            <li>the previous reviews were right, this is a total blackout mask.</li>
            <li>I have a very small face, and they fit me well.</li>
            <li>I had several so only recently had to purchase a new one.  </li>
            <li>This was a replacement for my last Bucky 40 blinks which had lasted nearly 5 years of constant use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it seems a little large for me</li>
            <li>Not too tight on my ears, stays in place, but a little light is sometimes let in around my nose</li>

            <li> I have bought a ton of masks, these are the only ones that stay put all night and block 100% of light.</li>
            <li> This is the only sleep mask to buy- doesn&#x27;t press against your eyes and completely blocks the light!</li>
            <li> Very comfortable to wear, however, I haven&#x27;t used other types for comparison....</li>
            <li> first one I bought at TJ Maxx when I noticed it was contoured &amp; not like your &amp;#34;typical&amp;#34; flat sleeping masks that I&#x27;ve had in the past &amp; not been happy about.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The head strap is long and can easily be adjusted to make the fit as snug or as loose as you desire.&lt;br /&gt;Velcro</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without these!</li>
            <li> Well made - delivered on time - high quality.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> In addition to lack of breathability mentioned in other reviews, the velcro on the strap, when adjusted properly to secure the mask gently on my face, also sticks to my hair.  </li>
            <li> The mask doesn&#x27;t irritate the lashes and completely blocks the light as long as it&#x27;s positioned correctly.</li>
            <li> I also have been able to wash them when necessary and lie out to dry.</li>
            <li> but after 4 years of use, I guess it was time for a new one!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , it packs well, and is formed such that I an open my eyes comfortably and blink even though I&#x27;m wearing the mask.  </li>
            <li> These masks are very comfortable for REM sleep due to the deep wells</li>
            <li> I work night shift, and apparently I have super long eye lashes, because without the eye pockets, I wouldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> However, they keep all light out and don&#x27;t feel to tight on your head.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m almost certain you&#x27;ll feel the same way!</li>
            <li> Not as good as the mask I bought from this company a few years ago, just in that it&#x27;s bigger so doesn&#x27;t fit as well on my small face, and I&#x27;m not used to the way the mask doesn&#x27;t lay flat against my eyes but bulges out a bit.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have needed a second one if our new fur-babies didn&#x27;t find my old one and use it as a tug toy.  </li>
            <li> They last a fairly long time so the price is amortized just about right.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t make me hot like other eye covers I have used.  </li>
            <li> I have had some other padded masks that seemed too hot.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Velcro back is secure and doesn&#x27;t hurt or get my hair caught in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allows very little light through (nose just a smudge because I have a small bridge).  </li>
            <li> It is much more rigid than previous ones and would not stay down on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back to order a couple of the new patterns because the one I&#x27;ve worn the past two years is just not as pretty as these new ones.</li>
            <li> the previous reviews were right, this is a total blackout mask.</li>
            <li> I have a very small face, and they fit me well.</li>
            <li> I had several so only recently had to purchase a new one.  </li>
            <li> This was a replacement for my last Bucky 40 blinks which had lasted nearly 5 years of constant use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it seems a little large for me</li>
            <li> Not too tight on my ears, stays in place, but a little light is sometimes let in around my nose</li>
            <li> The design of this sleep mask does help save your eye make up from getting smeared as long as you sleep on your back.</li>
            <li> It does not block light and will get bent and become further useless in my suitcase.</li>
            <li> Long trip to Singapore was a breeze.</li>
            <li> You can launder it in a lingerie bag; has a long life.</li>
            <li> I hear you should not soak them for a long time in the sink or they could disintegrate; I haven&#x27;t had that problem.</li>
            <li> This is the same review as on the Radial version since I bought both colors: Two years ago, my Opthalmologist diagnosed me with Sjogrens and welded my tear ducts closed.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to learn there was a whole line of Bucky Masks &amp; also colors/patterns besides boring</li>
            <li> I also use it at home sometimes since my bedroom windows face east; I sometimes like to sleep a little later on the weekends.</li>
            <li> Seems to work as expected.</li>
            <li> The edges (where the foam is &amp;#34;seared off&amp;#34; or cut) are sharp and hurt my face if I try to sleep on my side.</li>
            <li> probably because when sleeping on my side it touches the pillow and due to the fact that it is so rigid, it moves up on my face.  </li>
            <li> a problem I have had with other masks.)</li>
            <li> I have this in other colors - bought just in case they stop making them!</li>
            <li> They are black on the inside</li>
            <li> so you could blink and your eyes didn&#x27;t feel mushed &amp; a little cut-out to go around the nose.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s very dark.  </li>
            <li> no light and no pressure on the eye</li>
            <li> It just formed to my face after a few wears.  </li>
            <li> Too stiff if you try to sleep on your side.</li>
            <li> Even if you don&#x27;t use the beveled space for cold cotton balls or anything, the cool thing is that this doesn&#x27;t touch your eyes, so it won&#x27;t be uncomfortable on your eye lashes or anything.</li>
            <li> My backpack was recently stolen and my mask was inside so sadly gone...</li>
            <li> No light comes thru whatsoever!</li>
            <li> (I think after they saw complaints of how the material was separating/splitting by a few reviews, they worked on that!</li>
            <li> I have a small face</li>
            <li> that you hardly feel</li>
            <li> They do fall apart after a little bit, so I&#x27;ve just been stitching around the edges with thin thread that matches, and strategically placed knots.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing the Bucky 40 blinks mask for at least 5 years.</li>
            <li> This is a thin contoured  piece of nothing.</li>
            <li> I recently took it on vacation to block all of the hotel rooms annoying lights and it worked like a charm!  </li>
            <li> (some others have been so uncomfortable I couldn&#x27;t fall asleep).</li>
            <li> why would anyone do that, but it doesn&#x27;t press against your eyes, which can be very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> disappointed by this top-rated mask.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love these for day sleeping as I am a night shift.  Nurse!</li>
            <li> Well made - delivered on time - high quality. Have bought many, many sleep masks / none compare to this mask.  It is by far the best. Love the design, blocks all light, &amp; best of all when I blink my lashes do not rub on the mask. Highly recommend this product.  I will be buying more.  Want one for travel and one for home. If you want quality, excellent design &amp; comfort in a sleep mask this is the one to buy.</li>
            <li> Dogs love these masks too!  I have had to buy a couple of replacements of this.  The puppy thinks they are great chew toys.  However, they keep all light out and don&#x27;t feel to tight on your head.</li>
            <li> This is the only sleep mask to buy- doesn&#x27;t press against your eyes and completely blocks the light!</li>
            <li> In addition to lack of breathability mentioned in other reviews, the velcro on the strap, when adjusted properly to secure the mask gently on my face, also sticks to my hair.  Would not recommend for anyone who has...well, hair.</li>
            <li> The edges (where the foam is &amp;#34;seared off&amp;#34; or cut) are sharp and hurt my face if I try to sleep on my side. If I was a back sleeper that would be not an issue but since I am not, I cannot use this eye mask.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing the Bucky 40 blinks mask for at least 5 years. I work night shift, and apparently I have super long eye lashes, because without the eye pockets, I wouldn&#x27;t use it. I have to be able to move my eyes. They do fall apart after a little bit, so I&#x27;ve just been stitching around the edges with thin thread that matches, and strategically placed knots. They last about a year when I do. I also have been able to wash them when necessary and lie out to dry. I love these! All you night shifters out there.... This is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Jillian</li>
            <li> I love this mask. Works great to keep light out and it&#x27;s very comfortable.</li>
            <li> This is a thin contoured  piece of nothing. It does not block light and will get bent and become further useless in my suitcase. Go to target and get a buck seed one.</li>
            <li> These were lightweight and very comfortable.  They didn&#x27;t make me hot like other eye covers I have used.  They block the light well.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Bucky 40 Blinks sleep masks for years.  I had several so only recently had to purchase a new one.  It is much more rigid than previous ones and would not stay down on my cheeks.  The lower portion constantly moves up and into my eyes...probably because when sleeping on my side it touches the pillow and due to the fact that it is so rigid, it moves up on my face.  I actually cannot use it.  I am so disappointed!!</li>
            <li> Cute colors plus very easy to fit and wear.  I wore it on the plane on an overnight flight and it was quite comfortable.  I also use it at home sometimes since my bedroom windows face east; I sometimes like to sleep a little later on the weekends.</li>
            <li> Great night shades be sure to not put them in the washing machine... hand wash these.</li>
            <li> Love these things.  I&#x27;m a flight attendant and always keep one in my suitcase. Whether I am at home or on a trip  I seem to get better sleep when wearing my sleep mask.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been someone who wears eye masks to sleep. Most of the time they smash my eyes and I struggle with them coming too close to my nose. But this one is perfect! The eyes can open under the mask but keeps light out great and the nose is totally free from any fabric coming down. It&#x27;s the best eye mask I have had and highly recommend it</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd one. The first lasted many years. This is the bast sleep mask ever. Even if you don&#x27;t use the beveled space for cold cotton balls or anything, the cool thing is that this doesn&#x27;t touch your eyes, so it won&#x27;t be uncomfortable on your eye lashes or anything. You can open and close you&#x27;re eyes while wearing it.</li>
            <li> I love these face masks!  They are black on the inside so it&#x27;s very dark.  They conform to your face but they are shaped so that the pads don&#x27;t touch your eyes.  Great product.  I&#x27;ve been through several now and I&#x27;ve used each one for over a year before it needs to be replaced.</li>
            <li> I used my 1st Bucky mask through many deployments and travel and loved it. My backpack was recently stolen and my mask was inside so sadly gone...hence my need to purchase a 2nd one. I love this mask. I can open my eyes beneath the mask...yes, I understand...why would anyone do that, but it doesn&#x27;t press against your eyes, which can be very uncomfortable. It blocks all light from creeping in. Perfect eye mask!</li>
            <li> Long trip to Singapore was a breeze. The mask doesn&#x27;t irritate the lashes and completely blocks the light as long as it&#x27;s positioned correctly.</li>
            <li> This is my second Bucky sleep mask. The first one lasted about 8 years before the elastic band was shot.</li>
            <li> This is my second Bucky Sleep Mask!&lt;br /&gt;The first one I bought at TJ Maxx when I noticed it was contoured &amp; not like your &amp;#34;typical&amp;#34; flat sleeping masks that I&#x27;ve had in the past &amp; not been happy about. The first night I tried it, I was hooked! I had contoured eye spaces so you could blink and your eyes didn&#x27;t feel mushed &amp; a little cut-out to go around the nose. It was so light-weight you didn&#x27;t even know you had it on. I would hand wash it with Woolite every 2 weeks. The best part - total pitch dark! No light comes thru whatsoever! I had my first Bucky for 4 years until I wore it out - literally! The material began to separate &amp; it started to rip at the nose cutout...but after 4 years of use, I guess it was time for a new one!&lt;br /&gt;I was glad there was a &amp;#34;Bucky&amp;#34; tag on the side of the mask since I had purchased it from TJ Maxx because I wondered if I would ever find another! I was thrilled to learn there was a whole line of Bucky Masks &amp; also colors/patterns besides boring black!&lt;br /&gt;I also have to say that my NEW mask is even BETTER than the first!! This one is even lighter weight than the first, has even better shaping/conturing for the eye spaces &amp; nose, and is improved in the manufacturing. (I think after they saw complaints of how the material was separating/splitting by a few reviews, they worked on that! Thanks!)&lt;br /&gt;I am thinking of buying another version of their masks - and I never go to bed without it - especially if I have a nap during the day. I have sleeping problems &amp; since I started using this mask, it has truly improved my sleep &amp; reduced my sleeping problems. (I don&#x27;t have any &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; issues at home, but it seems that total darkness helps me get to sleep).&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for such a GREAT PRODUCT - I truly get 40 blinks!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
            <li> Love the Bucky 40 Blinks mask. I use it almost daily for naps, great for travel. You can launder it in a lingerie bag; has a long life. I hear you should not soak them for a long time in the sink or they could disintegrate; I haven&#x27;t had that problem.</li>
            <li> I have this in other colors - bought just in case they stop making them!</li>
            <li> I use these things every night! I am terribly sensitive to light and without my Bucky Mask I wake up constantly!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have needed a second one if our new fur-babies didn&#x27;t find my old one and use it as a tug toy.  Love this...no light and no pressure on the eye</li>
            <li> Not too tight on my ears, stays in place, but a little light is sometimes let in around my nose (I do have a big nose though! :-0 )</li>
            <li> Would love it more if it were actually the color that I ordered.  Ordered two of the lacy leaf pattern and one of this color - they all came in the lacy leaf pattern.  Not a problem with the product just the shippers.  I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t smash my eyes.  I have owned several of these and after awhile the inside lining starts to give way.  Otherwise a good product.</li>
            <li> i love this mask! the previous reviews were right, this is a total blackout mask. being able to blink under the mask and not feeling like your face is smushed is great!</li>
            <li> This mask is fantastic. it fits comfortably and does not smash my nose (a problem I have had with other masks.) Because it fits so well it blocks out all light and I love the material.</li>
            <li> Love this. Bought it as a replacement for one that I had for about 10 years! Perfect for blocking the morning sun.</li>
            <li> I wear this mask with my CPAP nightly and the light blocking is incredible.  Shape holds up well, it packs well, and is formed such that I an open my eyes comfortably and blink even though I&#x27;m wearing the mask.  This was a replacement for my last Bucky 40 blinks which had lasted nearly 5 years of constant use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product.  Plus all the pretty colors :-)</li>
            <li> This is the same review as on the Radial version since I bought both colors: Two years ago, my Opthalmologist diagnosed me with Sjogrens and welded my tear ducts closed. Since then, I have to put this gooey ointment in my eyes at night. I also have a Persian cat. Before I ordered my first mask from this vendor, every morning, my eyes were all gunked up with the greasy ointment and a bunch of hair. I tried another, but the eye wells were not as deep. This vendor is the one that I swear by and so does my Doc! I&#x27;m back to order a couple of the new patterns because the one I&#x27;ve worn the past two years is just not as pretty as these new ones. These masks are very comfortable for REM sleep due to the deep wells and I&#x27;m a side sleeper and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with the comfort level. The adjustable Velcro strap should make it work for anyone and if the extra Velcro is getting caught in your hair, wrap it with either a gauze or cloth band and secure it with a piece of paper or cloth tape. Works wonders for me and I&#x27;m almost certain you&#x27;ll feel the same way!</li>
            <li> This item my husband has renamed the &amp;#34;Eyekini&amp;#34; has been the best purchase!  Our bedroom filters light in the morning and I&#x27;m often awake at the crack of dawn but while using my eyekini I find myself sleeping longing and deeper.  I recently took it on vacation to block all of the hotel rooms annoying lights and it worked like a charm!  It is so comfortable that I don&#x27;t even realize it&#x27;s there most of the time.  It just formed to my face after a few wears.  I&#x27;m so happy with my eyekini that I&#x27;m buying them for all the women in my family.</li>
            <li> This sleep mask is so light weight and soft against your face that you hardly feel it.&lt;br /&gt;The molded eye sections are raised and do not make contact with your eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;This feature permits you to blink, if necessary, without your eyes feeling constricted.&lt;br /&gt;The head strap is long and can easily be adjusted to make the fit as snug or as loose as you desire.&lt;br /&gt;Velcro holds the strap together so there&#x27;s no floppy end.&lt;br /&gt;The sleep mask completely blocks out all light, allowing the wearer to enjoy a deep, undisturbed nights sleep.</li>
            <li> I use one of these 40 Blinks masks every night. They&#x27;re wonderful I have a very small face, and they fit me well. Totally block the light.</li>
            <li> Received one in my Christmas stocking, then bought these colorful sleep masks as gifts for a gals&#x27; getaway. Very comfortable to wear, however, I haven&#x27;t used other types for comparison....</li>
            <li> Too stiff if you try to sleep on your side.</li>
            <li> The design of this sleep mask does help save your eye make up from getting smeared as long as you sleep on your back.</li>
            <li> Keeps the light out without putting any pressure on your eyes. Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Seems to work as expected.</li>
            <li> I really like the Bucky sleep masks because they allow some eye movement when you have them on.  They last a fairly long time so the price is amortized just about right.</li>
            <li> I I love this mask. Stays on all night.</li>
            <li> Love love Bucky sleep masks. I have bought a ton of masks, these are the only ones that stay put all night and block 100% of light.</li>
            <li> This eye mask is so soft, and has pockets over the eyes that are so comfortable that, if you&#x27;re anything like me, you&#x27;ll never sleep without this thing again.</li>
            <li> I have a small face so it seems a little large for me and it slides onto my forehead during the night. Otherwise, I like that it has room for my eyelashes and  it doe keep all the light out.</li>
            <li> This is a great eye mask.  I&#x27;ve tried every brand / kind and this one is really my favorite.  It&#x27;s really comfortable and blocks out all the light.  Worth the money.</li>
            <li> My hopes were high for the Bucky 40 Blinks mask, as its design is almost perfect: comfortable and totally dark with huge comfortable pockets for your eyes. However, its made of a synthetic foam material that is non-absorbent and excellent at insulating - so expect to be woken up by pools of sweat where the mask (and thick elastic strap) comes in contact with your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed by this top-rated mask. Returned mine immediately.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the mask I bought from this company a few years ago, just in that it&#x27;s bigger so doesn&#x27;t fit as well on my small face, and I&#x27;m not used to the way the mask doesn&#x27;t lay flat against my eyes but bulges out a bit.  Also the colors are a bit more garish than it appears from the photo.  Still does the job, basically, though.</li>
            <li> We teasingly joked that this was the swim-top for my 18 pound American Eskimo dog, but it is a great sleep mask overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable and sturdy. Even if it falls off when I toss and turn - it won&#x27;t get ruined - no creases of I lay on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Velcro back is secure and doesn&#x27;t hurt or get my hair caught in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allows very little light through (nose just a smudge because I have a small bridge).  I&#x27;m able to blink my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not keep me awake (some others have been so uncomfortable I couldn&#x27;t fall asleep).</li>
            <li> Love this eye mask; the only one I can wear - doesn&#x27;t bother your eyelashes with the way it bubbles out over the eyes.</li>
            <li> These are amazing, third pair we&#x27;ve bought and these are hella sexy!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without these!</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd mask I have purchased and my 1st one lasted over 5 years.  Very comfortable to wear all night.</li>
            <li> I love this sleep mask.  It is adjustable with a velcro strap and fits very comfortable.  I have had some other padded masks that seemed too hot.  This one is designed so that the mask doesn&#x27;t press on your eyelids.  I also like the design (although my husband remarks that it looks like a bra on my eyes).  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This eyeshade does what it&#x27;s supposed to - block out light and not press on my eyelashes.  Bonus - it&#x27;s also really cute.</li>
            <li> Work night shift and this mask reallyrics blocks the light.</li>
            <li> Perfect light-blocking and the cupped eye design doesn&#x27;t interfere with normal nocturnal eye movements or bug my eyelashes. Nothing better than a Bucky brand sleep mask!</li>
            <li> These are the best sleep masks I&#x27;ve tried (and that&#x27;s a lot of them).  I have 3 pair. One for camping, one for home, one for travel.  I&#x27;m a very light sleeper,  and they are so comfortable, adjustable, and really block the light.  Couldn&#x27;t do without them now!</li>
