            <li>I have bought Pureology for years, so I was very excited to see I could save some money on it by buying it here!!</li>
            <li>so I figured will all the good reviews I would take my chances</li>
            <li>This has been AMAZING.</li>
            <li>A nice color-rpreserving shampoo.</li>
            <li>, it lathers very nicely even though its sulfate free.</li>
            <li>I had heard good things about pureology and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the nice thing is it doesn&#x27;t have salts or sulfates, so one&#x27;s color isn&#x27;t as strongly affected.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have drug store $5 shampoo that is much better than this one.  </li>
            <li>i love pureology, but i wouldn&#x27;t repurchase this one.  </li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t care for the scent and it seems a bit harsher than most of their products.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo because it literally removes all the gunk from the hair...</li>
            <li>love this shampoo because it tames my oily scalp when used once a week...</li>
            <li>love this shampoo because it comes in a really cute container and looks cute in my shower caddy :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a Sonicare toothbrush--once you try it you&#x27;ll never be able to go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Nice smell, much like tea tree oil and good for highlighted hair</li>
            <li>Since I color my hair, I wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t cause the color to fade and this truly keeps my hair healthy and shinny.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and how it helps...</li>
            <li>Yet it&#x27;s safe to use on my color-treated hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s sulfate free!</li>
            <li>This ais a fine shamppoo for keeping your color in and getting rid of residual shampoos, but it takes a bit more of it to get your hair really clean!</li>
            <li>this shampoo smelled real nice but didn&#x27;t seem to keep my hair clean as long as i would have liked.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair clean and free from product!  </li>
            <li>Pureology is extremely strong-</li>
            <li>Fantastic shampoo for oily, color treated hair, use 2-3 times per week</li>
            <li>This is the best shampoo I have ever used, and I can use it every day and have not any problem with hair being dried out.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a sulfate and sodium chloride free shampoo after a brazilian blowout, and came upon this one after reading reviews.</li>
            <li>Pureology is well worth the price!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Gives hair and clean and tingling feeling.</li>
            <li>It smells more natural than most shampoo&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t lather well but seems to get my hair clean.</li>
            <li>The most important thing when looking at reviews is to determine if the reviewer has similar hair to yours, the problem is most people don&#x27;t specify this in their reviews</li>
            <li>Feels cool on the scalp, and doesn&#x27;t strip hair.</li>
            <li>Like any purifying shampoo, you must gently work it through your hair as hair will tangle easily.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price....</li>
            <li>It does seem to help make hair coloring last.&lt;br /&gt;Also, seems to have improved the overall condition of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nicely scented, too</li>
            <li>It has a fresh, herbal scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used (more like natural oils rather than perfume), I like it</li>
            <li>I am never disappointed when I purchase from this whole line of products.</li>
            <li>Pureology does things right.</li>
            <li>My hair just didn&#x27;t feel right after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>this shampoo is great for clarifying your hair every few days - product gets built up in your hair and this stuff cleans it out!</li>
            <li>would NEVER use daily - monthly is more like</li>
            <li>, actually, that&#x27;s where it shines: use before coloring, so hair has no product buildup, and it will take the color more evenly and DEEPLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once you apply conditioner and rinse, your hair will be soft and silky and free of build up.</li>
            <li>I needed something clarifying but gentle enough for color and my fine hair.</li>
            <li>periodically (again once a month maybe) give your hair a really thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li>haha)</li>
            <li>I use this shampoo when I am about to get my hair dyed or when there is too much buildup on my hair and it needs to be stripped.</li>
            <li>Not only does it clean the hair, but it is gentle and does the job well.</li>
            <li>Its very cleansing (unlike many others that don&#x27;t have these ingredients) while not being too harsh.</li>
            <li>It completely stripped my color!!</li>
            <li>you use one of the new cleansing conditioners (like WEN)</li>
            <li>If you live an any drier climate you MUST buy this.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used this clarifying Shampoo my hair immediately appeared much shinier, but I only use it when my hair needs major cleansing from styling products because this is not a moisturizing shampoo.</li>
            <li>When I got the product, I thought it looked different the first time I used it, but I thought it must have been my imagination.</li>
            <li>They raised their prices by introducing new packaging, so the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; stuff is cheaper (old packaging,</li>
            <li>After a full bottle, my hair looks no better than when I first started using the shampoo except now</li>
            <li>I color my hair myself and was afraid that this shampoo would strip the color, but I&#x27;ve used it many times and the color in my hair is fine.</li>
            <li>I trust PUREOLOGY as the label is clear.  </li>
            <li>I really tried to like this shampoo and waited until I used an entire bottle before posting this review</li>
            <li>It completely takes out all the oils from your hair.</li>
            <li>This product is a complete lie.</li>
            <li>Works good but way too expensive.  </li>
            <li>From the first time I used this shampoo it made my hair (which is normally soft) feel dry and brittle</li>
            <li>Main drawback is the price, and a very mild subtle fragrance.</li>
            <li>I just wish this last bottle was the same as the first two.</li>
            <li>have long straight hair</li>
            <li>My scalp tends to be very oily with dry ends.  </li>
            <li>My hair tends to get very oily and with the suggestion of my stylist, I wash my hair about every 3 days (with a dry shampoo in between), so with the amount of oil and product build up over 3 days</li>
            <li>This product looked clear, runny, and with a funny smell and the REAL thing is green in color and more of a cream base.  </li>

            <li> Although it smells the same, it is white, not clear and much runnier, as though it has been watered down.</li>
            <li> The purpose of a shampoo is to clean your hair, no one wants to look like they have dirty hair.</li>
            <li> They make it hard to see the real list of ingredients, and the second ingredient is sodium lauryl sulfate.</li>
            <li> It left mine really dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> back to the one in the pink bottle for next time.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but just a small amount every few days makes my hair feel so clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> , you do get very deep cleansing, which tends to leave the hair rough.</li>
            <li> I DO NOT leave it long in my hair.</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This product in the line has a very specific use: remove buildup (of other products, &amp;#34;cones&amp;#34;, chlorine, and chemicals).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The first two came from a salon and the shampoo was perfectly clear and very thick (hard to squeeze out of the bottle).</li>
            <li> For me this is huge because my scalp itches like crazy with sulfates.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how dirty my hair felt before, until after using this, it just feels so CLEAN now.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way and it does the job of removing build up.  </li>
            <li> As with any Pureology product, you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> Breaks down hairspray, hair controlling mousse and gels, and air impurities without degrading the texture of your hair; and doesn&#x27;t strip any coloring processes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dont think I&#x27;m going to use any other brand!</li>
            <li> but it is a little pricey for the amount you get.  </li>
            <li> i still had to wash my hair everyday</li>
            <li> I was on the search for a clarifying shampoo because my hair was feeling heavy and sort of &#x27;built-up&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Does the job but not much better than average priced shampoos.</li>
            <li> TOo harsh - like washing hair in detergent.</li>
            <li> I had already used it a few times before thinking to look anyway...</li>
            <li> You need very little of it</li>
            <li> Have bought purology at the salon before n purple bottle and just had use small amount to lather.</li>
            <li> I look forward to the days I use it because they are usually &amp;#34;good hair days.&amp;#34; I have purchased this shampoo three times.</li>
            <li> you swim, it&#x27;s just about impossible to completely prevent chlorine buildup, so again maybe monthly use is satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The worst part about this shampoo is no matter how many times you apply and rinse it out, when you dry your hair it still looks oily and dirty and you can see the oil and feel it when running your fingers through it.</li>
            <li> My color is richer when I use this at least once a week.</li>
            <li> After using Kevin Murphy&#x27;s Maxi Wash, I wanted to find a similiar product that was less expensive.  </li>
            <li> I unfortunately also have oily hair.</li>
            <li> but this shampoo is horrible and let&#x27;s not even get started on the price ($25 for a small bottle!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Maybe Pureology changed the formula, maybe this was a bad batch or</li>
            <li> I also apply a base color and highlight my hair.</li>

            <li> Well worth the price.... It does seem to help make hair coloring last.&lt;br /&gt;Also, seems to have improved the overall condition of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nicely scented, too</li>
            <li> I really tried to like this shampoo and waited until I used an entire bottle before posting this review but it was hopeless from the start. The most important thing when looking at reviews is to determine if the reviewer has similar hair to yours, the problem is most people don&#x27;t specify this in their reviews so I figured will all the good reviews I would take my chances but this shampoo is horrible and let&#x27;s not even get started on the price ($25 for a small bottle!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long straight hair but I have a lot of hair. I also apply a base color and highlight my hair. My scalp tends to be very oily with dry ends.  From the first time I used this shampoo it made my hair (which is normally soft) feel dry and brittle but I figured that was part of the clarification process. No, it still feels like straw. The worst part about this shampoo is no matter how many times you apply and rinse it out, when you dry your hair it still looks oily and dirty and you can see the oil and feel it when running your fingers through it. Please refer to product photos  to see photos of this.  The purpose of a shampoo is to clean your hair, no one wants to look like they have dirty hair. After a full bottle, my hair looks no better than when I first started using the shampoo except now it looks oily all the time and feels like straw. I have drug store $5 shampoo that is much better than this one.  Don&#x27;t throw away your money like I did. Skip this shampoo!</li>
            <li> i love pureology, but i wouldn&#x27;t repurchase this one.  i don&#x27;t care for the scent and it seems a bit harsher than most of their products.  i&#x27;ll only use it about once every week or two.  back to the one in the pink bottle for next time.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo because it literally removes all the gunk from the hair...&lt;br /&gt;I love this shampoo because it tames my oily scalp when used once a week...&lt;br /&gt;I love this shampoo because it comes in a really cute container and looks cute in my shower caddy :)</li>
            <li> I have bought Pureology for years, so I was very excited to see I could save some money on it by buying it here!! When I got the product, I thought it looked different the first time I used it, but I thought it must have been my imagination. It completely stripped my color!! I went back to my colorist and she asked me what I was using and I told her \\&quot;the same thing I always use, but I bought it on Amazon this time.\\&quot;  She rushed out and got me a bottle from a stylist store and it was like night and day.  This product looked clear, runny, and with a funny smell and the REAL thing is green in color and more of a cream base.  I haven&#x27;t had a problem since with my hair fading prematurely. Will not buy again!!!</li>
            <li> I tend to have oily hair, so I need to wash it often. Even washing every day, isn&#x27;t enough for me. But with this shampoo, I can even skip days. It is expensive, but just a small amount every few days makes my hair feel so clean and smooth. It says it&#x27;s for color treated hair, but I use it on mine anyway. It also smells great!</li>
            <li> Fantastic shampoo for oily, color treated hair, use 2-3 times per week and it solves the problem without ruining your color.</li>
            <li> this shampoo smelled real nice but didn&#x27;t seem to keep my hair clean as long as i would have liked. i still had to wash my hair everyday</li>
            <li> Made my hair fall out. Could never recommend this product. Not only did my hair fall out, but the rest of my hair felt like steel wool.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every type of shampoo there is.  This is the only one that actually cleans.  It&#x27;s like a Sonicare toothbrush--once you try it you&#x27;ll never be able to go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: They changed the formula maybe three or four years ago and it no longer cleans like it used to. I stopped using this when they did.</li>
            <li> This product in the line has a very specific use: remove buildup (of other products, &amp;#34;cones&amp;#34;, chlorine, and chemicals).&lt;br /&gt;I would NEVER use daily - monthly is more like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, you do get very deep cleansing, which tends to leave the hair rough. A very good conditioner MUST be used in conjunction with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the nice thing is it doesn&#x27;t have salts or sulfates, so one&#x27;s color isn&#x27;t as strongly affected.&lt;br /&gt;And, actually, that&#x27;s where it shines: use before coloring, so hair has no product buildup, and it will take the color more evenly and DEEPLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use one of the new cleansing conditioners (like WEN), it doesn&#x27;t hurt to periodically (again once a month maybe) give your hair a really thorough cleaning. This is especially important if you are a silicone or styling  product junkie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you swim, it&#x27;s just about impossible to completely prevent chlorine buildup, so again maybe monthly use is satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind this is NOT a conditioning product (the hydrology line will leave hair silky) and understand what it is for, use prudently, condition after use, and you will reap the INTENDED results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do NOT shampoo twice. I DO NOT leave it long in my hair. I don&#x27;t need that degree of cleansing, just a periodic deep cleaning, as I call it. I DO NOT need a lot (all of pureology products are incredibly concentrated).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also got the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; 10 ounce bottle, BRAVO. They raised their prices by introducing new packaging, so the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; stuff is cheaper (old packaging, haha) and you get 20% more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle will last me well over two years.</li>
            <li> This ais a fine shamppoo for keeping your color in and getting rid of residual shampoos, but it takes a bit more of it to get your hair really clean!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended a purifying shampoo for me because there are minerals in my water. I color my hair myself and was afraid that this shampoo would strip the color, but I&#x27;ve used it many times and the color in my hair is fine. Like any purifying shampoo, you must gently work it through your hair as hair will tangle easily. Great product for scalp irritation from minerals.</li>
            <li> Feels cool on the scalp, and doesn&#x27;t strip hair. I can use it without conditioner, which is great. A nice color-rpreserving shampoo.</li>
            <li> I was on the search for a clarifying shampoo because my hair was feeling heavy and sort of &#x27;built-up&#x27;. I had heard good things about pureology and was not disappointed. This is the best shampoo I have ever used, and I can use it every day and have not any problem with hair being dried out. I didn&#x27;t realize how dirty my hair felt before, until after using this, it just feels so CLEAN now. Love it.</li>
            <li> Breaks down hairspray, hair controlling mousse and gels, and air impurities without degrading the texture of your hair; and doesn&#x27;t strip any coloring processes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gives hair and clean and tingling feeling.</li>
            <li> Works good but way too expensive.  Does the job but not much better than average priced shampoos.</li>
            <li> very good for oily hair, hair with product residue and dandruff.  Nice smell, much like tea tree oil and good for highlighted hair</li>
            <li> Not only does it clean the hair, but it is gentle and does the job well. Since I color my hair, I wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t cause the color to fade and this truly keeps my hair healthy and shinny.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair clean and free from product!  I love the smell and how it helps...I do use it with a  deep condition after.  I use this once a week and it&#x27;s perfect! Pureology is well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo when I am about to get my hair dyed or when there is too much buildup on my hair and it needs to be stripped. Every time I use it my hair is so silky and bouncy and luscious. I love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo. I was looking for a sulfate and sodium chloride free shampoo after a brazilian blowout, and came upon this one after reading reviews. Its very cleansing (unlike many others that don&#x27;t have these ingredients) while not being too harsh. Main drawback is the price, and a very mild subtle fragrance.</li>
            <li> After using Kevin Murphy&#x27;s Maxi Wash, I wanted to find a similiar product that was less expensive.  This fits the bill.  It lathers well, a little goes a long way and it does the job of removing build up.  Don&#x27;t let the coarse feel of your hair, post-shampoo, fool you.  Once you apply conditioner and rinse, your hair will be soft and silky and free of build up.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this clarifying Shampoo my hair immediately appeared much shinier, but I only use it when my hair needs major cleansing from styling products because this is not a moisturizing shampoo. I don&#x27;t think is intended to be used as a daily shampoo FYI.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. It completely takes out all the oils from your hair. It left mine really dry and brittle. I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I have color-treated hair, which requires a lot of product to style it. I unfortunately also have oily hair. I have tried shampoos from Kerastase to Aveda to drugstore brand in search of the best clarifier. Yes, I could use vinegar and smell like eau de vinegar or I could use this great product. Pureology is extremely strong- it cleans it all! Yet it&#x27;s safe to use on my color-treated hair. As with any Pureology product, you only need a small amount. It has a fresh, herbal scent. And best of all- it&#x27;s sulfate free! For me this is huge because my scalp itches like crazy with sulfates. I use this once per week, and it lasted me 6 mos. I&#x27;ll never go without it. Pureology does things right.</li>
            <li> this shampoo is great for clarifying your hair every few days - product gets built up in your hair and this stuff cleans it out!</li>
            <li> As I said for the conditioner, so awesome! Great on colored hair. My hair tends to get very oily and with the suggestion of my stylist, I wash my hair about every 3 days (with a dry shampoo in between), so with the amount of oil and product build up over 3 days I needed something clarifying but gentle enough for color and my fine hair. This has been AMAZING. Dont think I&#x27;m going to use any other brand!</li>
            <li> I ordered the Pureology Volumizing shampoo.  Do NOT  like  what I received.  Makes my hair feel like straw and&lt;br /&gt;stripped color.</li>
            <li> Perfect purifiy shampoo and smells wonderful as well. I trust PUREOLOGY as the label is clear.  My color is richer when I use this at least once a week. I am never disappointed when I purchase from this whole line of products.</li>
            <li> This is the best clarifying shampoo for colored hair.  It never strips color and it does a wonderful job of getting all the build up out.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this to me so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try, its a great shampoo, it lathers very nicely even though its sulfate free. It smells more natural than most shampoo&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used (more like natural oils rather than perfume), I like it and I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Have bought purology at the salon before n purple bottle and just had use small amount to lather. THis however have use a lot to make it lather and my hair felt like straw. It made me think maybe this was not a purolgy product in the container but I don&#x27;t know as I have never purchased the purify shampoo and maybe it is like that.  TOo harsh - like washing hair in detergent. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> This product is a complete lie. They make it hard to see the real list of ingredients, and the second ingredient is sodium lauryl sulfate. I had already used it a few times before thinking to look anyway... even though it is called &amp;#34;Zerosulfate&amp;#34;. I will never buy a Pureology product again.</li>
            <li> I had to give it away. My hair just didn&#x27;t feel right after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo. I use it 1-2 times a week just to get the crud out of my hair but it never strips my color. I look forward to the days I use it because they are usually &amp;#34;good hair days.&amp;#34; I have purchased this shampoo three times. The first two came from a salon and the shampoo was perfectly clear and very thick (hard to squeeze out of the bottle). You need very little of it so it lasts a long time. The last time I bought it on Amazon (from BeautyTime) and the shampoo itself is different. Although it smells the same, it is white, not clear and much runnier, as though it has been watered down. Maybe Pureology changed the formula, maybe this was a bad batch or maybe something is going on that&#x27;s not on the up and up. I just wish this last bottle was the same as the first two. I think I&#x27;ll go back to buying it in person somewhere.</li>
            <li> I like the shampoo but it is a little pricey for the amount you get.  Doesn&#x27;t lather well but seems to get my hair clean.</li>
            <li> This is a great product..especially if you have longer hair.  If you live an any drier climate you MUST buy this.  If you can only afford 1 bottle buy the shampoo..get conditioner later..</li>
