    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think any deoderant or antiperspirant is perfect.</li>
            <li>The stuff is the best I&#x27;ve found over the years.</li>
            <li>but afterwards it is incredible!</li>
            <li>Best antiperspirant deodorant.</li>
            <li>Great antiperspirant that does not stink!  </li>
            <li>Have used this product since I started using deoderant - unsented is the best.</li>
            <li>and my wife smells very, very good,</li>
            <li>I recommend to anyone looking for a great antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>Also smells great in the morning.</li>
            <li>Realllllllllly great.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really happy with their quality and how well it works for me.  </li>
            <li>Great product and prompt delivery.  </li>
            <li>Great price &amp; convenient ordering</li>
            <li>I have successfully used Ban Roll-On Unscented deodorant since it came to the market</li>
            <li>If you want to smell like something use cologne or perfume but use this superior product underneath and you will be thrilled!</li>
            <li>Just put it on when you get up, and by the time you are getting dressed, your armpits should be good to go.</li>
            <li>Shipping was on time and arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li>of course she always smells good.</li>
            <li>This product is absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had any kind of reaction to this deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Use at your own risk?</li>
            <li>Effective.</li>
            <li>It is BY FAR the best deodorant I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I shake it upside-down before using to get it to work better.</li>
            <li>I love ti deodorant.</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read that roll-ons may be the contributor to this, so maybe my many years of using Ban caused my hyperhidrosis.</li>
            <li>/&gt;2 day shipping was also free, Amazon Prime Rocks!</li>
            <li>But I found this Ban Roll-on Antiperspirant Deodorant many years ago</li>
            <li>Simply the best.</li>
            <li>more so this recommendation will be published.  </li>
            <li>Oops, one more word needed.  </li>
            <li>I guess I have been using this brand for a while, and love it because it IS unscented.  </li>
            <li>Love that I can order it here.</li>
            <li>There has been (8) communications from Amazon (and counting) regarding this order, plus one phone call to \\&quot;customer service\\&quot; (or lack thereof</li>
            <li>Scent free, effective.</li>
            <li>I am also very happy because I was lucky enough to get the three pack that includes a travel size for free!  </li>
            <li>Maybe I loved it too much, because after years of use, my armpits are immune to ALL deodorants.</li>
            <li>The unscented version is perfect to combine with a cologne or eau de toilette, as it doesn&#x27;t compete with other scents.  </li>
            <li>Replacing the cap is so easy that a caveman could do it.  </li>
            <li>Does the job...convenient container and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Thus, the amount of aluminum chlorohydrate in here works fine for me.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Would purchase again if available.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is so great because I dont have different scents on me anymore</li>
            <li>Very good product, just have to let dry first!</li>
            <li>Seems every week there is a new product on the market promising to do more, add more, save more, etc.</li>
            <li>:)  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Sometimes I have to go sit in front of a fan with my arms up or take a hair dryer on cool to my armpits</li>
            <li>/&gt;Can&#x27;t say if it stains clothes as I dont wear very much whites or light clothing.</li>
            <li>Normally I would be a stinky sweaty mess by work, even with what I thought was the best deodorant before, the Mitchum gel.</li>
            <li>But you wont find those white marks on your blacks with this for sure!</li>
            <li>I use this product about 2 or 3x a day to stay fresh.</li>
            <li>These are not expressly marketed as \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; but they sure do a heck of a job.  </li>
            <li>I am a 43 year old guy and there has never been a better deodorant ever.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways, if you let this dry it is amazing.</li>
            <li>It applies nicely, dries quickly, cleans up easy enough with soap, lasts through the day, doesn&#x27;t stain my clothing, and for being unscented, it doesn&#x27;t have a noticeably strange underlying odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have always been a very very stinky person.</li>
            <li>The whole time I was paranoid and smelling my arms but nothing!</li>
            <li>Also, being a guy means I don&#x27;t want the stuff that smells like flowers and such. :)</li>
            <li>The first time I used this and every so often this does not work at all.</li>
            <li>was scared the first day I tried it thinking it wouldn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>My otherwise beautiful and wonderful girlfriend uses it and it is by far the worst product known to man.</li>
            <li>I have been using this deodorant my whole life.  </li>
            <li>The top unscrews with minimal effort.  </li>
            <li>I bought this at Walgreens but this deodorant really works for me!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really like the product.</li>
            <li>The small bottle is fine for travelers: it&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t leak.  </li>
            <li>like..when Ive used other deodorants they just mostly mask the smell with it&#x27;s scent</li>
            <li>keep my underarms dry and odor free.  </li>
            <li>I wish this was more organic and less chemically harmful.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommended it to my friends and relatives.</li>
            <li>ban dries fast and leave no traces in my shirts, lasts easily all day long, even lasts after overnight travels as I&#x27;ve noticed no odor the next day.</li>
            <li>If you use the product, this is exactly the same stuff you would buy in the store, so you already know what it is.  </li>
            <li>If I really cared I could reapply it, but it really only wears off towards the end of the day.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve tried the natural deodorants and can&#x27;t stand those either.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sticky when you first put it on and it takes awhile to dry</li>
            <li>and I stick with it because it does exactly what it is expected to do...</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this deodorant a few years ago after reading that, among commercial antiperspirants, it has the fewest bad-for-you chemicals.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I originally purchased this deodorant a few years ago after reading that, among commercial antiperspirants, it has the fewest bad-for-you chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Both the Mitchum and Dry Idea left white clumpy stains on my clothes even after they were washed.</li>
            <li> Not only did it last all day with no scent, my arms stayed dry.</li>
            <li> I routinely have to stand in a crowded bus or train with my arms flat at my sides, in winter clothes on the heated subway.</li>
            <li> It should be impossible, but this works just amazingly well.</li>
            <li> It keeps me dry and stink-free without extra fragrances.  </li>
            <li> The only issue is that it can take about 30 minutes to dry.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the last ones I purchased with the new package is no longer working, it&#x27;s like using pure water.</li>
            <li> I used to suffer several problems like rash and other skin-related problems, stains in my shirts, need to reapply several times a day, bottles that leaks, some scent (even in unscented versions) and</li>
            <li> The only thing that works for me and there is no greasy wet residue.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long, long time, and appreciate the ability to buy this online.  </li>
            <li> Ironically enough, some \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; deodorants are very harsh.  </li>
            <li> It lasts all day long!</li>
            <li> can Amazon require other sellers to be accountable and transparent(in the form of seller feedback) when Amazon is unwilling to do the same?</li>
            <li> I Tried Dry Idea and Mitchum \\&quot;Powder Fresh\\&quot; which is supposed to be a women&#x27;s antiperspirant</li>
            <li> With this deodorant you MUST LET IT DRY 100%.</li>
            <li> Go watch the weather, wait for some water to boil, but don&#x27;t get dressed until it&#x27;s ENTIRELY dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does take a minute or two to dry</li>
            <li> but after a while, I skipped trying to wait for it to fully dry</li>
            <li> You must let it dry for two minutes after applying but if used correctly NOTHING anywhere at any price compares.  </li>
            <li> They also stayed very dry.</li>
            <li> Despite being prime stinky conditions this morning, I arrived at work smelling just like when I left, no sweat, not even a little.</li>
            <li> If you put on a shirt while it&#x27;s wet you wipe it all off</li>
            <li> It has absolutely no odor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lived far too long with antiperspirants to go back, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it one star because I&#x27;m wishing upon that one star that she starts using something other than this water bottle on a stick.</li>
            <li> One has been shipped 28 DEC 12, and the other is in limbo.</li>
            <li> There is no standard for what makes a \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; deodorant, so manufacturers throw that label around meaninglessly, often on deodorants loaded with perfumes, dyes, etc.  </li>
            <li> , then there&#x27;s slight smell of BO, and then my perfume.</li>
            <li> I bought the unscented so it doesn&#x27;t mess with my cologne or aftershave.</li>
            <li> I spent so long looking for deodorants and all of them made me smell worse and were clumpy.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m completely serious), but it MUST BE DRY.</li>
            <li> I am past 40 years now.</li>
            <li> No better deodorant brand.</li>
            <li> I smell worse than with any other deodorant</li>
            <li> She actually smells worse, yes, worse than before applying it to her under pit areas of doom.</li>
            <li> And because it&#x27;s truly unscented you don&#x27;t smell like some silly locker room pit scent or -  on the other end of the spectrum -  a bed of roses.  </li>
            <li> You know that smell of overheated baboon feces you get when you take a wrong turn at the zoo?</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been embarrassed to lift my arms up because of how bad I reek.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed and I will no longer buy or/and recommend Ban deodorant.</li>
            <li> The scented items are awful!</li>
            <li> This has been a miserable experience.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It did the job and makes it safe for me to enter into crowds without ill effect.  I especially like the fact that Ban still uses the rollball dispenser.</li>
            <li> Took a shower this morning, it is 7:18 am now, and i do not have a underarm odor problem, omg i smell like i have not put anything on. I know it is unscented, but geez, i would hope it would help against BO. I bought because it does not leave any underarm streaks but i would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> The only thing that works for me and there is no greasy wet residue. It lasts all day long! Only the unscented. The scented items are awful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying a myriad of deodorants and antiperspirants until I found ban. I used to suffer several problems like rash and other skin-related problems, stains in my shirts, need to reapply several times a day, bottles that leaks, some scent (even in unscented versions) and the list goes on.  After I started to use ban, all those problems are gone! ban dries fast and leave no traces in my shirts, lasts easily all day long, even lasts after overnight travels as I&#x27;ve noticed no odor the next day. The unscented version is perfect to combine with a cologne or eau de toilette, as it doesn&#x27;t compete with other scents.  The small bottle is fine for travelers: it&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t leak.  After almost 10 years using it, no complains! I recommend to anyone looking for a great antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd roll-on antiperspirant I have bought. I Tried Dry Idea and Mitchum \\&quot;Powder Fresh\\&quot; which is supposed to be a women&#x27;s antiperspirant but it just smells like baby powder. Both the Mitchum and Dry Idea left white clumpy stains on my clothes even after they were washed. I bought this Ban roll-on at Wal-Mart and I haven&#x27;t had that problem. This is a unisex product. I bought the unscented so it doesn&#x27;t mess with my cologne or aftershave. I believe this cost about $3.50 for one bottle. I shake it upside-down before using to get it to work better. The only problem with roll-on products is that sometimes being a guy my underarm hairs get caught in the roll-on thing which pulls at them and hurts. This product works well. Giving 4 stars. I don&#x27;t think any deoderant or antiperspirant is perfect. I use this product about 2 or 3x a day to stay fresh.</li>
            <li> Ironically enough, some \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; deodorants are very harsh.  There is no standard for what makes a \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; deodorant, so manufacturers throw that label around meaninglessly, often on deodorants loaded with perfumes, dyes, etc.  These are not expressly marketed as \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; but they sure do a heck of a job.  I&#x27;ve never had any kind of reaction to this deodorant.  Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Very good product, just have to let dry first!</li>
            <li> If you use the product, this is exactly the same stuff you would buy in the store, so you already know what it is.  By buying in bulk, you save money, time, and gas.  The stuff is the best I&#x27;ve found over the years.</li>
            <li> Deodorant delivered to the door. What a deal.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this deodorant a few years ago after reading that, among commercial antiperspirants, it has the fewest bad-for-you chemicals.  It keeps me dry and stink-free without extra fragrances.  :)  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have been using this deodorant my whole life.  It has worked for me.  I am past 40 years now.</li>
            <li> I love ti deodorant. It&#x27;s relally works.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant. Maybe I loved it too much, because after years of use, my armpits are immune to ALL deodorants. I&#x27;ve read that roll-ons may be the contributor to this, so maybe my many years of using Ban caused my hyperhidrosis. Use at your own risk?</li>
            <li> My otherwise beautiful and wonderful girlfriend uses it and it is by far the worst product known to man. She actually smells worse, yes, worse than before applying it to her under pit areas of doom. You know that smell of overheated baboon feces you get when you take a wrong turn at the zoo? Yeah that&#x27;s what this is like... Times 20. Also smells great in the morning. Realllllllllly great. I&#x27;m giving it one star because I&#x27;m wishing upon that one star that she starts using something other than this water bottle on a stick.</li>
            <li> I have successfully used Ban Roll-On Unscented deodorant since it came to the market and I highly recommended it to my friends and relatives. Unfortunately, the last ones I purchased with the new package is no longer working, it&#x27;s like using pure water. I&#x27;m very disappointed and I will no longer buy or/and recommend Ban deodorant.</li>
            <li> I COULD NOT FIND THE UNSCENTED BAN ROLLON IT THJE STORE. I FOUND IT ON THE WEBSITE SO I- I ORDERED IT AND WELL PLEASE WIRTH IT</li>
            <li> I have always been a very very stinky person. I spent so long looking for deodorants and all of them made me smell worse and were clumpy. I&#x27;ve always been embarrassed to lift my arms up because of how bad I reek. I tried this deodorant and I am amazed. Not only did it last all day with no scent, my arms stayed dry. I even went and did one of the hardest workouts WITH someone training me. The whole time I was paranoid and smelling my arms but nothing! They also stayed very dry. It&#x27;s sticky when you first put it on and it takes awhile to dry but afterwards it is incredible! I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever switch.</li>
            <li> When I made my purchase this 3 pack was actually cheaper than Wal-Mart.  I am also very happy because I was lucky enough to get the three pack that includes a travel size for free!  I&#x27;ve been using Ban unscented for years and I&#x27;m really happy with their quality and how well it works for me.  Also, being a guy means I don&#x27;t want the stuff that smells like flowers and such. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 day shipping was also free, Amazon Prime Rocks!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this and every so often this does not work at all. I smell worse than with any other deodorant and it&#x27;s useless. With this deodorant you MUST LET IT DRY 100%. Sometimes I have to go sit in front of a fan with my arms up or take a hair dryer on cool to my armpits (I&#x27;m completely serious), but it MUST BE DRY. If you put on a shirt while it&#x27;s wet you wipe it all off and it&#x27;s useless. Go watch the weather, wait for some water to boil, but don&#x27;t get dressed until it&#x27;s ENTIRELY dry. If it&#x27;s sticky, it&#x27;s not dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, if you let this dry it is amazing. It is BY FAR the best deodorant I&#x27;ve used. I routinely have to stand in a crowded bus or train with my arms flat at my sides, in winter clothes on the heated subway. Normally I would be a stinky sweaty mess by work, even with what I thought was the best deodorant before, the Mitchum gel. This blows it out of the park. Despite being prime stinky conditions this morning, I arrived at work smelling just like when I left, no sweat, not even a little. It should be impossible, but this works just amazingly well. I also work with computers, which requires you to have your arms pressed to your sides to type a lot and this lasts almost all day. If I really cared I could reapply it, but it really only wears off towards the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Best antiperspirant deodorant. Effective.</li>
            <li> Seems every week there is a new product on the market promising to do more, add more, save more, etc. But I found this Ban Roll-on Antiperspirant Deodorant many years ago and I stick with it because it does exactly what it is expected to do...keep my underarms dry and odor free.  I subscribe to your auto shipment program because I never want to be without it.  Simply the best.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing.  The top unscrews with minimal effort.  The roller is spherical and simply glides over the target area with ease.  Replacing the cap is so easy that a caveman could do it.  I am in awe of this product.</li>
            <li> Great antiperspirant that does not stink!  No additional smell!  I for one do not need to have a replacement odor coming from my pits!!!</li>
            <li> As advertised.  I have to write 18 words more so this recommendation will be published.  So here they are. Oops, one more word needed.  Now I am over.  Oh well.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long, long time, and appreciate the ability to buy this online.  Beats having to run to the store when you suddenly run out.</li>
            <li> If you want to ruin your shirts with yellow under arm stains buy this product.</li>
            <li> I do not sweat profusely. Thus, the amount of aluminum chlorohydrate in here works fine for me. It has absolutely no odor. The only issue is that it can take about 30 minutes to dry. Just put it on when you get up, and by the time you are getting dressed, your armpits should be good to go.</li>
            <li> Does the job...convenient container and easy to apply.  No residue deposit.  Would purchase again if available.  Shipping was on time and arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Walgreens but this deodorant really works for me!&lt;br /&gt;I was scared the first day I tried it thinking it wouldn&#x27;t work because..well it&#x27;s watery and unscented..so how could it?!  But I went on about my day and suprisingly,  no stank!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take a minute or two to dry but after a while, I skipped trying to wait for it to fully dry and it still works! (I still fan it for a couple seconds though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is so great because I dont have different scents on me anymore like..when Ive used other deodorants they just mostly mask the smell with it&#x27;s scent, then there&#x27;s slight smell of BO, and then my perfume. Now i just smell like perfume or nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say if it stains clothes as I dont wear very much whites or light clothing. But you wont find those white marks on your blacks with this for sure!</li>
            <li> I guess I have been using this brand for a while, and love it because it IS unscented.  Love that I can order it here.</li>
            <li> Great product and prompt delivery.  No better deodorant brand.</li>
            <li> I am a 43 year old guy and there has never been a better deodorant ever.  You must let it dry for two minutes after applying but if used correctly NOTHING anywhere at any price compares.  And because it&#x27;s truly unscented you don&#x27;t smell like some silly locker room pit scent or -  on the other end of the spectrum -  a bed of roses.  Most deodorant scents (including baby powder and those made by Ban) are horribly fake / chemical smelling.  If you want to smell like something use cologne or perfume but use this superior product underneath and you will be thrilled!</li>
            <li> It work like it should and my wife smells very, very good, of course she always smells good. that is all</li>
            <li> Have used this product since I started using deoderant - unsented is the best. Never plan on changing either unless they quit making unsented...</li>
            <li> I wish this was more organic and less chemically harmful. But I&#x27;ve tried the natural deodorants and can&#x27;t stand those either. I&#x27;ve lived far too long with antiperspirants to go back, unfortunately. This one is unscented and does the job.</li>
            <li> I really like the product. It applies nicely, dries quickly, cleans up easy enough with soap, lasts through the day, doesn&#x27;t stain my clothing, and for being unscented, it doesn&#x27;t have a noticeably strange underlying odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for delivery, I&#x27;ve had a quantity of (2) on order since 12 OCT 12. One has been shipped 28 DEC 12, and the other is in limbo. There has been (8) communications from Amazon (and counting) regarding this order, plus one phone call to \\&quot;customer service\\&quot; (or lack thereof I should say).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How can Amazon require other sellers to be accountable and transparent(in the form of seller feedback) when Amazon is unwilling to do the same? This has been a miserable experience. (sold and shipped by Amazon)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had nothing but lies and misdirection from \\&quot;customer service\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Great price &amp; convenient ordering</li>
            <li> Safeway dropped this product so I order online.  Scent free, effective.</li>
            <li> Puchased for my husband. He loves the lack of fragrance and its long-used and trusted results.</li>
