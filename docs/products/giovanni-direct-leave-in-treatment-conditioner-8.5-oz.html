            <li>Also the smell is great :)</li>

            <li>AND IT SMELLS AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Amazing leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>As you may imagaine I was thrilled to find this leave in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I washed and conditioned my hair with my own products, then put in the leave in condionter.</li>
            <li>I like for my hair products to smell nice</li>
            <li>Aloe is good for many things but hair is not one of them.</li>
            <li>to me it smells like a nice cup of tea</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t know what kind</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel nice.</li>
            <li>Conditions nicely and softens.</li>
            <li>It does nice thing for my hair and is quite inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I was even able to maintain pretty good 2 day hair!!</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years and was very pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with this product so far!</li>
            <li>Giovanni Direct Leave in Conditioner is the best I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>This is the best leave-in I&#x27;ve tried by far.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing, light, melts in my hair, it&#x27;s a good detangler, fairly priced and smells good.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and may be a good product for the right hair type.</li>
            <li>I had nice, shiny plump curls and bends the next day, plus the most compliments ever on my hair!!!</li>
            <li>I love that you don&#x27;t need a lot at all, so go easy ladies!</li>
            <li>It is very light weight and didn&#x27;t leave a residue on my hair.  </li>
            <li>and the scent is also very light and wears off as your hair dries.</li>
            <li>The shipment was sent quickly and was a good price.  </li>
            <li>It is a wonderful product and I would definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li>But I am glad that I did.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>If it was just neutral it would be okay</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more of this.  </li>
            <li>The container can be better as you have to force the product out each time.</li>
            <li>I have tried many leave in conditioner</li>
            <li>but this is the one that I fell in love with.</li>
            <li>I love this leave-in.</li>
            <li>It has a lot more ingredients than are listed.</li>
            <li>So I tried it as a deep conditioner, and it was perfect, just added some grape seed oil to it.  </li>
            <li>I accidentially purchased 2 bottles and I am glad for my error.  </li>
            <li>Instead, it is more like free-flowing Crisco.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ABSOLUTELY LOVE</li>
            <li>I call this &#x27;Magic Hair Cream&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>so we can assume that they are being enjoyed.</li>
            <li>and so glad I did</li>
            <li>As an added bonus, this product is organic and cruelty free!</li>
            <li>Able to stretch it, also.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s way more in stores.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this and definately will purchase again  where the pricing is better.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend and I both use this and love it.</li>
            <li>and Im pleased</li>
            <li>but I wanted a lil more.</li>
            <li>TO ME ITS BETTER AS A PRE WASH.</li>
            <li>Im satisfied</li>
            <li>dont need a lotvand very ligt smells great</li>
            <li>Many of my friends love it too.</li>
            <li>but I have discovered an even better leave-in for curly hair.</li>
            <li>Its called curls unleashed organic root stimulator :)</li>
            <li>I love this leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>this, along with the Giovanni Smooth as Silk conditioner and shampoo, and the VitaPro fusion treatment seems to help a lot!</li>
            <li>I saw so many reviews on this product that was saying wonderful things prior to the formula change.</li>
            <li>and I have to say I agree with most reviews.</li>
            <li>I am in LOVE with this product.</li>
            <li>Seems like my hair is more greasy in using this product.</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>i LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>but I am glad it does.</li>
            <li>I order this product in hopes of getting something better then my \\&quot;Shea Butter\\&quot; leave in.</li>
            <li>Try it, you will love it</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li>I really LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>IT BEST TO USE ON TOWEL DRY HAIR.</li>
            <li>I have wavy, fine, shoulder length, dirty-blonde hair that is just more stubborn than I am.</li>
            <li>I love its light weight texture and the effect it has on my hair.  </li>
            <li>This product is great as defining curls and leaves your hair feeling soft all day.</li>
            <li>Great product for my natural hair.</li>
            <li>Its lightweight and moisturizing and is quickly becoming a go to product for me.</li>
            <li>I just putA  some on after washing my hair follow it with their volume boost , takes me 4 mins and my hair looks amazingly healthy , light , and bouncy...</li>
            <li>Great slip and soft hold for all styles.</li>
            <li>I love the light weight feel of this product.</li>
            <li>Anyway, other than that, this is an excellent leave in-</li>
            <li>I have kinky bohemian curly hair that dries out very quickly.</li>
            <li>We strongly prefer organic products and research all ingredients to make an informed purchase.</li>
            <li>Giovanni is an excellent product if you want NATURAL, but as far as moisturizing, which is what I wanted Its ok, explains the 4 stars.</li>
            <li>It has a slightly acidic ph which is best for hair.</li>
            <li>We wanted a leave-in conditioner to protect her fine, smooth, corkscrew curls from drying out and hair breakage.</li>
            <li>In addition to helping my hair stay soft and smelling slightly girly (in a good way), my waves remain perfectly preserved throughout the day regardless of the humidity level.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s surprisingly light in my fine hair and gives me that day after shampoo look</li>
            <li>I ended up purchasing this product because I needed something else to make the shipping free.  </li>
            <li>I was introduced to it while reading a customer&#x27;s review for another product, and fortunately gave it a try.</li>
            <li>great moisturizer for your hair gave it a 4 because if you use it with another oil based product it makes your hair white but will disappear within 5 minutes</li>
            <li>I can also get it at Target and the Vitamin Shoppe, so it&#x27;s readily available.</li>
            <li>I searched on youtube and watched a video by \\&quot;kimmaytube\\&quot; about the ph balance of hair and why the ph balance of your product is so important.</li>
            <li>If I knew how to make my own, trust me I would, but until I learn I&#x27;ll be using the consumer ready stuff.</li>
            <li>In terms of consistency, the cream goes in smooth.</li>
            <li>It is NOT weightless or light even.</li>
            <li>have relaxed hair so the protein/moisture balance is extremely important to reduce breakage and retain length.</li>
            <li>This product is quite light, but it does moisturize to an extent(I guess it depends on your hair type).</li>
            <li>This leave-in is light, yet moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair look fabulous.</li>
            <li>packaging is attractive, although it can be tricky to get the product out when it runs low in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I honestly like the product just ran out too fast for me.</li>
            <li>Fantastic leave-in conditioner</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a week and so far its been good.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s more natural than other conditioners, it provides great slip for detangling and a nice hit of protein for your hair.</li>
            <li>Because I live in a desert climate I am constantly searching for an excellent conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love on the first day, taming flyways and locking in moisture and shine -plus</li>
            <li>The only negatives I have are: The smell....not a pleasant scent</li>
            <li>Words can&#x27;t really describe how much I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It has a light fresh scent.</li>
            <li>wish that when a product is good they would simply leave it alone.  </li>
            <li>My hair is natural and it makes it feel really nice.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling soft and it has a nice fragrance-nothing overpowering.</li>
            <li>Like many others with very curly hair, I&#x27;ve sworn off shampoo, using this in its place and again as a conditioner.</li>
            <li>Not a bad moisturizer at all.</li>
            <li>They work great and cost about 25% of what other organics do.</li>
            <li>My hair felt like it was better moisturized, softer and it smells pretty good too without being overpowering like other products I have used, it&#x27;s light and fresh.  </li>
            <li>most products on the market today have entirely too many chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The direct leave-in is very nice and makes your hair feel soft and silky.</li>
            <li>so the site was pretty accurate.</li>
            <li>At first my hair felt smooth but them began klumping up.</li>
            <li>The prime reason I found about this is because they ARE A CRUELTY FREE COMPANY , Lets keep supporting these companies</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t know how much good it will do for me long term yet.</li>
            <li>This product would probably be great for someone that needs less hold/control.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;I used it on wet hair the first couple of times and it did not work that great</li>
            <li>Also, fast shipping !!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is great if you experience trouble retaining moisture.</li>
            <li>and it seems I have to use a lot more than I have with the old formula.</li>
            <li>It would be useful to have this in a pump rather than a squeeze bottle.</li>
            <li>, I love it so far.</li>
            <li>i started making the Kimmaytube conditioner which wins every time.</li>
            <li>original formula was  identified on the bottle as Pure Organic.  </li>
            <li>However, I have searched high and low for a good leave in for my daughter</li>
            <li>My hair is coarse but very fine, so I can&#x27;t use moisturizing oils or creams - they&#x27;re too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am african american with type 4b hair, since this product was great for all hair types i tried it.</li>
            <li>Standard is still the same great way.  </li>
            <li>It was soft and easy to come.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it very much for my hair.</li>
            <li>I find that it leaves my hair feeling pretty crI spy afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product consistently for four years.  </li>
            <li>The product is better on damp afro hair if you don&#x27;t want any white residue on your hair.</li>
            <li>Leery at first, I eventually decided to try it out after cowashing and before sealing and braiding.</li>
            <li>I see what all the fuss is about now ;)</li>
            <li>you had more than enough leave-in already.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Overall im satisfied.</li>
            <li>This seems to work pretty well in my hair.</li>
            <li>Why are you paing more for the same item?</li>
            <li>Glad I only ordered one bottle and not a 3 set.</li>
            <li>Will buy more in the future!</li>
            <li>I have read many blogs on which people rave about this product, especially for curly hair.</li>
            <li>I find the Direct Leave-In to be too light for my hair.</li>
            <li>First miss from Giovanni.</li>
            <li>FIRST IT SOFTENS HAIR</li>
            <li>Love it, makes my kinky hair manageable, bought a bigger one after i finished this one.</li>
            <li>Versatile as well - you can layer it on overnight for a deep treatment and my hubbs uses it to shave :)</li>
            <li>Found other products to be more fitting since I have gone natural.</li>
            <li>After reading many highly rated reviews, I had high hopes that this leave-in conditioner would detangle and condition my long fine colored and permed hair.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t wait to get to Whole Foods to buy the Direct Leave-In along with Smooth as Silk shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I tried this product for the first time and my hair which is normally coarse and dry felt amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been \\&quot;natural\\&quot; (my hair is a mix of 3C, 4A and 4B) for a little over 9 months and have tried multiple leave-ins throughout these months and to say that Giovanni&#x27;s Direct Leave-In is the best I have tried would be an understatement.</li>
            <li>This light leave-in conditioner keeps my natural hair thoroughly moisturized, and is light enough to not over power my styling products.</li>
            <li>Not bad as far as product goes.</li>
            <li>My 3 year old cries every time I brush her hair, even straight out of the bath with clean hair.  </li>
            <li>If you have hair like mine that tends to be dry you&#x27;ll probably need an additional moisturizing product on top of this one.&lt;br /&gt;The smell:</li>
            <li>Better to use with dry hair.</li>
            <li>The cream is rich, but because it has alcohol you may find yourself applying more than usual.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t really need much of this conditioner in your hair.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s also another product on here called kinky curls or \\&quot;Shea Moisture Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Curl &amp; Hold Smoothie\\&quot;, both, imo, work really well.</li>
            <li>Love this brand a lot, arrived when expected.</li>
            <li>I did try it as a leave-In, but there was way too much build up, and I had difficulty combing thru my hair.  </li>
            <li>Product came fast and was sealed in plastic for safety.</li>
            <li>and sometimes I feel I have to do way too much for wash and gos.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately this is too light and doesn&#x27;t provide enough slip to detangle or keep it untangled,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The search goes on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light &amp; doesn&#x27;t flake or leave white stuff in my head when paired with my gel.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t figure nor am I too stressed with the whole type thing...</li>
            <li>The product is very lite weight and works well in my children&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really care for it in mone.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a product that really does moisturize my hair.</li>
            <li>I would buy this again  because i really like it</li>
            <li>It is inexpensive so you really don&#x27;t have to order it online.</li>
            <li>I kept feeling it through the day and sure it enough, it was still soft.  </li>
            <li>However if you are a newly natural, this is a trusty cannot go wrong product that is inexpensive and gives excellent results.</li>
            <li>and I actually just looked it up at my local Wal-Mart (because I do not like to depend on products I can&#x27;t get on a whim with a quick trip down the street) to make sure this is a product I will be able to have in supply whenever I need it.</li>
            <li>I had heard wonderful things about it from other websites devoted to African American Naturally Curly/Coily hair and had always thought \\&quot;one day\\</li>
            <li>, not sticky doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel heavy, leaves it very light, smells nice, i recommend to anyone who is natural an needs a too leave-in for dry hair.</li>
            <li>I have really frizzy mixed hair that I usually wear curly, and this product kept my curls looking nice and smooth for days.</li>
            <li>I hope other reviewers have a better experience, but I will not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li>You never get that combination with many other leave in conditioners.</li>
            <li>We lightly mist with water, apply Giovanni Direct, comb with wide tooth comb, and do a quick finger twist of curls, ponytails, etc.</li>
            <li>My hair is really coily, fine, dense, and dry.</li>
            <li>Really disappointed because I had heard so many great things about this line.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time on my natural hair.</li>
            <li>the past 6 months I discovered that this product became Eco friendly and no longer hair friendly.</li>
            <li>You think that you don&#x27;t have enough and add more only to find out</li>
            <li>Now it has been reformalized, with aloe added as the main ingredient.  </li>
            <li>It is the same exact thing I was looking for .It defines my curles perfectly, no frizz at all and very good volume without heaviness or clumping.</li>
            <li>It smells okay, not sweet or flowery or anything you like your hair to smell like.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for at least two years and love it!</li>
            <li>I highly suggest purchasing...</li>
            <li>Thing is, they&#x27;re a little more pricey than this Giovanni product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is a little more dense</li>
            <li>LOVE IT AND A LITTLE OF THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li>have 4A natural hair and this product is the BUSINESS!!</li>
            <li>Anyway, if you can find the old formula with (oils) instead of aloe vera gel in the new formula, I highly recommend to buy it!</li>
            <li>But the next day, it is super soft.</li>
            <li>Her curls dry the slightest bit crunchy, but a light squeeze frees them to a natural bounce.</li>
            <li>Very light weight and leaves my curls fluffy and soft.</li>
            <li>When I began using the older formula my hair was shiny, soft and managable.  </li>
            <li>not only are they being compassionate and socially responsible but they are creating high quality products!</li>
            <li>I use it right after a wash for flat twist outs and Bantu knot outs.</li>
            <li>This is the first product I have found that leaves my hair feeling soft, and not dry and oily at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>It definitely did help keep more moisture in my hair, but that lasted for only a short time - my hair just didn&#x27;t respond well to this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I order this product assuming that I will be getting the exact same product i had.</li>
            <li>Just be aware that they might send you one with different ingredients!</li>
            <li>and this was a pretty big mistake for me.</li>
            <li>Yay Giovanni Direct leave In!</li>
            <li>My hair had become so dry and brittle from fun in the sun that I couldn&#x27;t even get a comb through it.</li>
            <li>My hair stays soft and moisturized from the time that I put it in my hair early in the morning until I go bed at night.</li>
            <li>Giovanni Direct Leave</li>
            <li>&quot; I&#x27;ll check it out and just haven&#x27;t in years I&#x27;ve been natural.  </li>
            <li>But to the review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied this product to my hair directly after washing and towel drying my hair in sections of four.  </li>
            <li>and my hair still feels soft and moisturized even though I haven&#x27;t even sprayed my hair with anything at all.  </li>
            <li>I put it on my natural hair and couldn&#x27;t believe it.  </li>
            <li>yep, still soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft, shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li>The minute I put this product in my hair, It felt so soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I am a natural.</li>
            <li>and my hair is really soft from this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used almost every leave-in under the sun, until one day I began to use natural oils (jojoba, coconut)...</li>
            <li>all, I&#x27;m saying this product is not as natural as it seems, and no leave-in conditioner should have alcohol as the 4th ingredient.</li>
            <li>all, I&#x27;m saying this product is not as natural as it seems, and no leave-in conditioner should have alcohol as the 4th ingredient.</li>
            <li>This product definitely makes detangling my hair much easier since it gives it plenty of slip.</li>
            <li>It appears to enhance my naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>It works well as a detangler and moisturizer when used directly  after washing hair with a denman.</li>
            <li>Her hair is soft but needs a thicker leave-in for moisture.</li>
            <li>As far as shipping it took my product about a wk to get here</li>
            <li>Makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>This leave-in does the job on natural hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone natural.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling really soft.</li>
            <li>but I must say, I was pleasantly surprised once I used</li>
            <li>Leaves the kidd hair soft and manageable</li>
            <li>Also, it make your hair really soft.</li>
            <li>I NOTICE MY HAIR WAS WAY SOFT.</li>
            <li>direct</li>
            <li>It is not as shiny and soft as with Kimmaytube&#x27;s recipe on my 4a/b hair .</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to all who wear their hair natural.</li>
            <li>I find that this conditioner gives my hair a soft, shiny look yet</li>
            <li>I have 4a/4b medium length natural hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have a good leave-in product without a bunch of nasty chemicals.  </li>
            <li>This has been about the only leave in that does not weigh down my fine hair when I do wash and go style.</li>
            <li>The main problem, and it&#x27;s a big one, is stickiness.  </li>
            <li>It was not, I&#x27;m not saying this is not a good product, but my natural hair response better to \\&quot;Shea</li>
            <li>Did a fabulous job of conditioning my Black American hair.  </li>
            <li>was just ok.. not sure what I expected but was like normal conditioner in my hair rather than a leave in</li>
            <li>Before ordering this leave in, my hair was super dry and products would only last for a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li>But the back of my hair was pretty close to dry by the time I was finishing up the front.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes it squirts out much too fast and it is difficult to open the top and put the extra back in the container.</li>
            <li>I use it as a leave in after washing and it has not really hardened my hair as mentioned in another comment but it has not reall done much in the way of moistre either.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m big on organic/ natural products with no sulfate.</li>
            <li>in order to use up the bottle, I now use the rest in the shower and it doesn&#x27;t condition or detangle very well wet either.  </li>
            <li>Going back to my old conditioner...</li>
            <li>I have natural, course hair (dreadlocks, actually)</li>
            <li>I have seen this product numerous times on natural blogs</li>
            <li>This left my hair pretty sticky and coarse even when it was dry.</li>
            <li>have very curly, coarse, dry hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of different avenues to try and tame this mane with my scrunch and air dry routine - deep conditioners, moisturizing shampoo and conditioner duos, leave ins, argan oil, hair oil, pequi oil, etc, and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I heard a lot of hype about this product on youtube and several other blogs that were actually pretty referable.</li>
            <li>Moisturizes curly hair very well and leaves hair feeling soft without drying or leaving a heavy buildup.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an African American woman with natural 3c hair with 4a in my crown area...</li>
            <li>I have natural african american hair and this product does wonders.</li>
            <li>African american mom with natural daughter</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African American with natural hair</li>
            <li>Besides as a natural hair girl, I was searching for a product that was all natural or mostly natural and this product does not fit that bill.</li>
            <li>it is organic, the scent is barely discernible, and a dollop the size of a dime is plenty for her entire head of 5-inch curls.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an African American woman that recently went from relaxed to natural hair, so I&#x27;ve been experimenting with products that will keep my hair moisturized and</li>
            <li>This could be because I used more leave-in than I normally use since this product is not as thick as my usual leave-in.</li>
            <li>What I found most annoying was this stuff would dry out after 5 minutes leaving this weird, gooey textured hair, and the more I tried to comb through it the more</li>
            <li>It does not weigh the hair down much at all.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair at all, no matter how much I use.</li>
            <li>the product itself is great, but I only received about 3/4 of the product because the bottle was punctured :(</li>
            <li>it on dry hair, it made my hair sooo soft and detangled.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I use this I still use a natural Shea butter mixture with it and my hair does not end up being oily and dry.</li>
            <li>EverybodieS hair is different and mine is typical right on the verge of being dry.</li>
            <li>I have been trying a few different products to find one that works for me and had I not spent so much on it</li>
            <li>The ultimate test was when I had tried a new shampoo and conditioner that left my hair very dry.</li>
            <li>And the ends of my hair seem to curl around each other a little better which cuts down on the amount of gel I have to use.  </li>
            <li>And the consistency is also light, which is a plus for me since my hair is very thick and</li>

            <li> It is a wonderful product and I would definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> But I am glad that I did.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> If it was just neutral it would be okay</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more of this.  </li>
            <li> The container can be better as you have to force the product out each time.</li>
            <li> I have tried many leave in conditioner</li>
            <li> but this is the one that I fell in love with.</li>
            <li> I love this leave-in.</li>
            <li> It has a lot more ingredients than are listed.</li>
            <li> So I tried it as a deep conditioner, and it was perfect, just added some grape seed oil to it.  </li>
            <li> I accidentially purchased 2 bottles and I am glad for my error.  </li>
            <li> Instead, it is more like free-flowing Crisco.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE</li>
            <li> I call this &#x27;Magic Hair Cream&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> so we can assume that they are being enjoyed.</li>
            <li> and so glad I did</li>
            <li> As an added bonus, this product is organic and cruelty free!</li>
            <li> Able to stretch it, also.  </li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s way more in stores.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this and definately will purchase again  where the pricing is better.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I both use this and love it.</li>
            <li> and Im pleased</li>
            <li> but I wanted a lil more.</li>
            <li> TO ME ITS BETTER AS A PRE WASH.</li>
            <li> Im satisfied</li>
            <li> dont need a lotvand very ligt smells great</li>
            <li> Many of my friends love it too.</li>
            <li> but I have discovered an even better leave-in for curly hair.</li>
            <li> Its called curls unleashed organic root stimulator :)</li>
            <li> I love this leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> this, along with the Giovanni Smooth as Silk conditioner and shampoo, and the VitaPro fusion treatment seems to help a lot!</li>
            <li> I saw so many reviews on this product that was saying wonderful things prior to the formula change.</li>
            <li> and I have to say I agree with most reviews.</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with this product.</li>
            <li> Seems like my hair is more greasy in using this product.</li>
            <li> Okay.</li>
            <li> i LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> but I am glad it does.</li>
            <li> I order this product in hopes of getting something better then my \\&quot;Shea Butter\\&quot; leave in.</li>
            <li> Try it, you will love it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this leave-in conditioner.</li>

            <li> I really LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> IT BEST TO USE ON TOWEL DRY HAIR.</li>
            <li> I have wavy, fine, shoulder length, dirty-blonde hair that is just more stubborn than I am.</li>
            <li> I love its light weight texture and the effect it has on my hair.  </li>
            <li> This product is great as defining curls and leaves your hair feeling soft all day.</li>
            <li> Great product for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> Its lightweight and moisturizing and is quickly becoming a go to product for me.</li>
            <li> I just putA  some on after washing my hair follow it with their volume boost , takes me 4 mins and my hair looks amazingly healthy , light , and bouncy...</li>
            <li> Great slip and soft hold for all styles.</li>
            <li> I love the light weight feel of this product.</li>
            <li> Anyway, other than that, this is an excellent leave in-</li>
            <li> I have kinky bohemian curly hair that dries out very quickly.</li>
            <li> We strongly prefer organic products and research all ingredients to make an informed purchase.</li>
            <li> Giovanni is an excellent product if you want NATURAL, but as far as moisturizing, which is what I wanted Its ok, explains the 4 stars.</li>
            <li> It has a slightly acidic ph which is best for hair.</li>
            <li> We wanted a leave-in conditioner to protect her fine, smooth, corkscrew curls from drying out and hair breakage.</li>
            <li> In addition to helping my hair stay soft and smelling slightly girly (in a good way), my waves remain perfectly preserved throughout the day regardless of the humidity level.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s surprisingly light in my fine hair and gives me that day after shampoo look</li>
            <li> I ended up purchasing this product because I needed something else to make the shipping free.  </li>
            <li> I was introduced to it while reading a customer&#x27;s review for another product, and fortunately gave it a try.</li>
            <li> great moisturizer for your hair gave it a 4 because if you use it with another oil based product it makes your hair white but will disappear within 5 minutes</li>
            <li> I can also get it at Target and the Vitamin Shoppe, so it&#x27;s readily available.</li>
            <li> I searched on youtube and watched a video by \\&quot;kimmaytube\\&quot; about the ph balance of hair and why the ph balance of your product is so important.</li>
            <li> If I knew how to make my own, trust me I would, but until I learn I&#x27;ll be using the consumer ready stuff.</li>
            <li> In terms of consistency, the cream goes in smooth.</li>
            <li> It is NOT weightless or light even.</li>
            <li> have relaxed hair so the protein/moisture balance is extremely important to reduce breakage and retain length.</li>
            <li> This product is quite light, but it does moisturize to an extent(I guess it depends on your hair type).</li>
            <li> This leave-in is light, yet moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair look fabulous.</li>
            <li> packaging is attractive, although it can be tricky to get the product out when it runs low in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I honestly like the product just ran out too fast for me.</li>
            <li> Fantastic leave-in conditioner</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a week and so far its been good.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s more natural than other conditioners, it provides great slip for detangling and a nice hit of protein for your hair.</li>
            <li> Because I live in a desert climate I am constantly searching for an excellent conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love on the first day, taming flyways and locking in moisture and shine -plus</li>
            <li> The only negatives I have are: The smell....not a pleasant scent</li>
            <li> Words can&#x27;t really describe how much I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It has a light fresh scent.</li>
            <li> wish that when a product is good they would simply leave it alone.  </li>
            <li> My hair is natural and it makes it feel really nice.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling soft and it has a nice fragrance-nothing overpowering.</li>
            <li> Like many others with very curly hair, I&#x27;ve sworn off shampoo, using this in its place and again as a conditioner.</li>
            <li> Not a bad moisturizer at all.</li>
            <li> They work great and cost about 25% of what other organics do.</li>
            <li> My hair felt like it was better moisturized, softer and it smells pretty good too without being overpowering like other products I have used, it&#x27;s light and fresh.  </li>
            <li> most products on the market today have entirely too many chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The direct leave-in is very nice and makes your hair feel soft and silky.</li>
            <li> so the site was pretty accurate.</li>
            <li> At first my hair felt smooth but them began klumping up.</li>
            <li> The prime reason I found about this is because they ARE A CRUELTY FREE COMPANY , Lets keep supporting these companies</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t know how much good it will do for me long term yet.</li>
            <li> This product would probably be great for someone that needs less hold/control.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;I used it on wet hair the first couple of times and it did not work that great</li>
            <li> Also, fast shipping !!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is great if you experience trouble retaining moisture.</li>
            <li> and it seems I have to use a lot more than I have with the old formula.</li>
            <li> It would be useful to have this in a pump rather than a squeeze bottle.</li>
            <li> , I love it so far.</li>
            <li> i started making the Kimmaytube conditioner which wins every time.</li>
            <li> original formula was  identified on the bottle as Pure Organic.  </li>
            <li> However, I have searched high and low for a good leave in for my daughter</li>
            <li> My hair is coarse but very fine, so I can&#x27;t use moisturizing oils or creams - they&#x27;re too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am african american with type 4b hair, since this product was great for all hair types i tried it.</li>
            <li> Standard is still the same great way.  </li>
            <li> It was soft and easy to come.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it very much for my hair.</li>
            <li> I find that it leaves my hair feeling pretty crI spy afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product consistently for four years.  </li>
            <li> The product is better on damp afro hair if you don&#x27;t want any white residue on your hair.</li>
            <li> Leery at first, I eventually decided to try it out after cowashing and before sealing and braiding.</li>
            <li> I see what all the fuss is about now ;)</li>
            <li> you had more than enough leave-in already.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Overall im satisfied.</li>
            <li> This seems to work pretty well in my hair.</li>
            <li> Why are you paing more for the same item?</li>
            <li> Glad I only ordered one bottle and not a 3 set.</li>
            <li> Will buy more in the future!</li>
            <li> I have read many blogs on which people rave about this product, especially for curly hair.</li>
            <li> I find the Direct Leave-In to be too light for my hair.</li>
            <li> First miss from Giovanni.</li>
            <li> FIRST IT SOFTENS HAIR</li>
            <li> Love it, makes my kinky hair manageable, bought a bigger one after i finished this one.</li>
            <li> Versatile as well - you can layer it on overnight for a deep treatment and my hubbs uses it to shave :)</li>
            <li> Found other products to be more fitting since I have gone natural.</li>
            <li> After reading many highly rated reviews, I had high hopes that this leave-in conditioner would detangle and condition my long fine colored and permed hair.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to get to Whole Foods to buy the Direct Leave-In along with Smooth as Silk shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for the first time and my hair which is normally coarse and dry felt amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been \\&quot;natural\\&quot; (my hair is a mix of 3C, 4A and 4B) for a little over 9 months and have tried multiple leave-ins throughout these months and to say that Giovanni&#x27;s Direct Leave-In is the best I have tried would be an understatement.</li>
            <li> This light leave-in conditioner keeps my natural hair thoroughly moisturized, and is light enough to not over power my styling products.</li>
            <li> Not bad as far as product goes.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old cries every time I brush her hair, even straight out of the bath with clean hair.  </li>
            <li> If you have hair like mine that tends to be dry you&#x27;ll probably need an additional moisturizing product on top of this one.&lt;br /&gt;The smell:</li>
            <li> Better to use with dry hair.</li>
            <li> The cream is rich, but because it has alcohol you may find yourself applying more than usual.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t really need much of this conditioner in your hair.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also another product on here called kinky curls or \\&quot;Shea Moisture Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Curl &amp; Hold Smoothie\\&quot;, both, imo, work really well.</li>
            <li> Love this brand a lot, arrived when expected.</li>
            <li> I did try it as a leave-In, but there was way too much build up, and I had difficulty combing thru my hair.  </li>
            <li> Product came fast and was sealed in plastic for safety.</li>
            <li> and sometimes I feel I have to do way too much for wash and gos.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately this is too light and doesn&#x27;t provide enough slip to detangle or keep it untangled,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The search goes on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light &amp; doesn&#x27;t flake or leave white stuff in my head when paired with my gel.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t figure nor am I too stressed with the whole type thing...</li>
            <li> The product is very lite weight and works well in my children&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really care for it in mone.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a product that really does moisturize my hair.</li>
            <li> I would buy this again  because i really like it</li>
            <li> It is inexpensive so you really don&#x27;t have to order it online.</li>
            <li> I kept feeling it through the day and sure it enough, it was still soft.  </li>
            <li> However if you are a newly natural, this is a trusty cannot go wrong product that is inexpensive and gives excellent results.</li>
            <li> and I actually just looked it up at my local Wal-Mart (because I do not like to depend on products I can&#x27;t get on a whim with a quick trip down the street) to make sure this is a product I will be able to have in supply whenever I need it.</li>
            <li> I had heard wonderful things about it from other websites devoted to African American Naturally Curly/Coily hair and had always thought \\&quot;one day\\</li>
            <li> , not sticky doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel heavy, leaves it very light, smells nice, i recommend to anyone who is natural an needs a too leave-in for dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have really frizzy mixed hair that I usually wear curly, and this product kept my curls looking nice and smooth for days.</li>
            <li> I hope other reviewers have a better experience, but I will not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> You never get that combination with many other leave in conditioners.</li>
            <li> We lightly mist with water, apply Giovanni Direct, comb with wide tooth comb, and do a quick finger twist of curls, ponytails, etc.</li>
            <li> My hair is really coily, fine, dense, and dry.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed because I had heard so many great things about this line.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time on my natural hair.</li>
            <li> the past 6 months I discovered that this product became Eco friendly and no longer hair friendly.</li>
            <li> You think that you don&#x27;t have enough and add more only to find out</li>
            <li> Now it has been reformalized, with aloe added as the main ingredient.  </li>
            <li> It is the same exact thing I was looking for .It defines my curles perfectly, no frizz at all and very good volume without heaviness or clumping.</li>
            <li> It smells okay, not sweet or flowery or anything you like your hair to smell like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for at least two years and love it!</li>
            <li> I highly suggest purchasing...</li>
            <li> Thing is, they&#x27;re a little more pricey than this Giovanni product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is a little more dense</li>
            <li> LOVE IT AND A LITTLE OF THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li> have 4A natural hair and this product is the BUSINESS!!</li>
            <li> Anyway, if you can find the old formula with (oils) instead of aloe vera gel in the new formula, I highly recommend to buy it!</li>
            <li> But the next day, it is super soft.</li>
            <li> Her curls dry the slightest bit crunchy, but a light squeeze frees them to a natural bounce.</li>
            <li> Very light weight and leaves my curls fluffy and soft.</li>
            <li> When I began using the older formula my hair was shiny, soft and managable.  </li>
            <li> not only are they being compassionate and socially responsible but they are creating high quality products!</li>
            <li> I use it right after a wash for flat twist outs and Bantu knot outs.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I have found that leaves my hair feeling soft, and not dry and oily at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> It definitely did help keep more moisture in my hair, but that lasted for only a short time - my hair just didn&#x27;t respond well to this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> I order this product assuming that I will be getting the exact same product i had.</li>
            <li> Just be aware that they might send you one with different ingredients!</li>
            <li> and this was a pretty big mistake for me.</li>
            <li> Yay Giovanni Direct leave In!</li>
            <li> My hair had become so dry and brittle from fun in the sun that I couldn&#x27;t even get a comb through it.</li>
            <li> My hair stays soft and moisturized from the time that I put it in my hair early in the morning until I go bed at night.</li>
            <li> Giovanni Direct Leave</li>
            <li> &quot; I&#x27;ll check it out and just haven&#x27;t in years I&#x27;ve been natural.  </li>
            <li> But to the review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied this product to my hair directly after washing and towel drying my hair in sections of four.  </li>
            <li> and my hair still feels soft and moisturized even though I haven&#x27;t even sprayed my hair with anything at all.  </li>
            <li> I put it on my natural hair and couldn&#x27;t believe it.  </li>
            <li> yep, still soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft, shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li> The minute I put this product in my hair, It felt so soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I am a natural.</li>
            <li> and my hair is really soft from this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used almost every leave-in under the sun, until one day I began to use natural oils (jojoba, coconut)...</li>
            <li> all, I&#x27;m saying this product is not as natural as it seems, and no leave-in conditioner should have alcohol as the 4th ingredient.</li>
            <li> all, I&#x27;m saying this product is not as natural as it seems, and no leave-in conditioner should have alcohol as the 4th ingredient.</li>
            <li> This product definitely makes detangling my hair much easier since it gives it plenty of slip.</li>
            <li> It appears to enhance my naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> It works well as a detangler and moisturizer when used directly  after washing hair with a denman.</li>
            <li> Her hair is soft but needs a thicker leave-in for moisture.</li>
            <li> As far as shipping it took my product about a wk to get here</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> This leave-in does the job on natural hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone natural.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling really soft.</li>
            <li> but I must say, I was pleasantly surprised once I used</li>
            <li> Leaves the kidd hair soft and manageable</li>
            <li> Also, it make your hair really soft.</li>
            <li> I NOTICE MY HAIR WAS WAY SOFT.</li>
            <li> direct</li>
            <li> It is not as shiny and soft as with Kimmaytube&#x27;s recipe on my 4a/b hair .</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to all who wear their hair natural.</li>
            <li> I find that this conditioner gives my hair a soft, shiny look yet</li>
            <li> I have 4a/4b medium length natural hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have a good leave-in product without a bunch of nasty chemicals.  </li>
            <li> This has been about the only leave in that does not weigh down my fine hair when I do wash and go style.</li>
            <li> The main problem, and it&#x27;s a big one, is stickiness.  </li>
            <li> It was not, I&#x27;m not saying this is not a good product, but my natural hair response better to \\&quot;Shea</li>
            <li> Did a fabulous job of conditioning my Black American hair.  </li>
            <li> was just ok.. not sure what I expected but was like normal conditioner in my hair rather than a leave in</li>
            <li> Before ordering this leave in, my hair was super dry and products would only last for a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li> But the back of my hair was pretty close to dry by the time I was finishing up the front.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it squirts out much too fast and it is difficult to open the top and put the extra back in the container.</li>
            <li> I use it as a leave in after washing and it has not really hardened my hair as mentioned in another comment but it has not reall done much in the way of moistre either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m big on organic/ natural products with no sulfate.</li>
            <li> in order to use up the bottle, I now use the rest in the shower and it doesn&#x27;t condition or detangle very well wet either.  </li>
            <li> Going back to my old conditioner...</li>
            <li> I have natural, course hair (dreadlocks, actually)</li>
            <li> I have seen this product numerous times on natural blogs</li>
            <li> This left my hair pretty sticky and coarse even when it was dry.</li>
            <li> have very curly, coarse, dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of different avenues to try and tame this mane with my scrunch and air dry routine - deep conditioners, moisturizing shampoo and conditioner duos, leave ins, argan oil, hair oil, pequi oil, etc, and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I heard a lot of hype about this product on youtube and several other blogs that were actually pretty referable.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes curly hair very well and leaves hair feeling soft without drying or leaving a heavy buildup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American woman with natural 3c hair with 4a in my crown area...</li>
            <li> I have natural african american hair and this product does wonders.</li>
            <li> African american mom with natural daughter</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American with natural hair</li>
            <li> Besides as a natural hair girl, I was searching for a product that was all natural or mostly natural and this product does not fit that bill.</li>
            <li> it is organic, the scent is barely discernible, and a dollop the size of a dime is plenty for her entire head of 5-inch curls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American woman that recently went from relaxed to natural hair, so I&#x27;ve been experimenting with products that will keep my hair moisturized and</li>
            <li> This could be because I used more leave-in than I normally use since this product is not as thick as my usual leave-in.</li>
            <li> What I found most annoying was this stuff would dry out after 5 minutes leaving this weird, gooey textured hair, and the more I tried to comb through it the more</li>
            <li> It does not weigh the hair down much at all.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair at all, no matter how much I use.</li>
            <li> the product itself is great, but I only received about 3/4 of the product because the bottle was punctured :(</li>
            <li> it on dry hair, it made my hair sooo soft and detangled.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I use this I still use a natural Shea butter mixture with it and my hair does not end up being oily and dry.</li>
            <li> EverybodieS hair is different and mine is typical right on the verge of being dry.</li>
            <li> I have been trying a few different products to find one that works for me and had I not spent so much on it</li>
            <li> The ultimate test was when I had tried a new shampoo and conditioner that left my hair very dry.</li>
            <li> And the ends of my hair seem to curl around each other a little better which cuts down on the amount of gel I have to use.  </li>
            <li> And the consistency is also light, which is a plus for me since my hair is very thick and</li>
            <li> At first it seemed to be making my hair soft, but the next morning, my hair was hard as a rock!</li>
            <li> heard about Giovanni from other natural women on YouTube</li>
            <li> You really have to measure out a small amount of this or it will have your hair fully white.</li>
            <li> Works as well as more expensive natural leave-in&#x27;s but for less money.  </li>
            <li> With the current product my hair acts as though I left a big glob of conditioner in it, it is dull and very sticky.  </li>
            <li> She seems to make it last a long time.</li>
            <li> I also mix it with a little water and use it to moisturize my ends and seal with jojoba oil and my hair stays soft all day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black women who enjoys my hair natural.</li>
            <li> It works all right as a leave-in conditioner, but I think that the scent could definitely be improved upon, because it&#x27;s very strong and absolutely disgusting.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for this product much due to the white residue it left in my hair.</li>
            <li> I think one of the other reviews said it left white stuff in her hair.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and defines my curls a little.</li>
            <li> but it has this strange unpleasantness to it that had I known</li>
            <li> I am hispanic with long 2c/3a hair.  </li>
            <li> My staple/holy grail leave in since I BCd had always been Herbal Essences Long Term Relationship, which worked quite well, but I kept hearing about this product.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and use a squirt between pea-</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t go without it for long.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy residue, and makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing the natural hair thing for a few months now</li>
            <li> GOES A LONG WAY.</li>
            <li> I can say this product has provided me with soft, fluffy, and moisturized hair for 2-3 days!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t wait to see how it works in the long term.</li>
            <li> But I hate when I see all good reviews for a product and try it</li>
            <li> People rave about this stuff but for me it weighed my hair down and left a white cast.</li>
            <li> Maybe a little heavy, but I could be using too much.</li>
            <li> It left my extremely knotted, and dry.</li>
            <li> but if you have dry curly hair...forget about it....</li>
            <li> any damp product in my hair tends to have an extended amount of time to dry.  </li>
            <li> I let my hair air dry</li>
            <li> By the end of the day, my hair is usually dry as a bone.</li>
            <li> I passed it on to another curly with thicker, less coarse hair</li>
            <li> I use it on wet, damp, and dry hair.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair very dry, did not add any moisture to my hair.  </li>
            <li> , I just don&#x27;t understand the wide price fluctuations.</li>
            <li> It actually makes my stands stick together and become limp.</li>
            <li> I think it sort of suds up after putting in hair when wet.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that i wish the bottle was bigger, but a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> I found it to be as heavy as a regular conditioner and on top of all that it stinks!</li>
            <li> I tried a little in my Caucasian type hair and it left it feeling weighed down.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The new formula sucks!</li>
            <li> overall it defines my curls but leaves my scalp extremely itchy!!!</li>
            <li> In fact we looked at other Giovanni products and bought some for ourselves.</li>
            <li> While this product may work well for some, it did not exactly work well for me.  </li>
            <li> , I wonder didn&#x27;t one other person feel like this?</li>
            <li> I might try another&lt;br /&gt;one of their gels or their other products.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try Giovanni&#x27;s other products.  </li>
            <li> Due to the lack of ph compatibility with the hair follicle, you may incur some damage.</li>
            <li> Due to the lack of ph compatibility with the hair follicle, you may incur some damage.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t use it with other products</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any other leave in conditioner at this point since this one seems to be working.</li>
            <li> was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount, which I rub all through my just washed hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought this item due to the million reviews I Read on naturallycurly.com and the reviews in other places.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not open to trying the products I mentioned, do yourself a favor and start experimenting with preferences, or at least learn about hair and ph balance.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not open to trying the products I mentioned, do yourself a favor and start experimenting with preferences, or at least learn about hair and ph balance.</li>
            <li> Although I do not like my hair to feel greasy or weighed down...</li>
            <li> Detangles, moisturizers, does not weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> A lightweight leave in which firms the hair and allows for manageability without weighting down my shaft.</li>
            <li> so I knew this wouldn&#x27;t let me down.</li>
            <li> I had less breakeage and it helped with detangling.</li>
            <li> white clumps and not a good moisturizer</li>
            <li> Not cool.</li>
            <li> I have  long thick afro-american type hair</li>
            <li> this doesn&#x27;t do enough for my curly hair...not a bad product if you have normal or oily hair...</li>
            <li> little of this product goes a very long way, at least in my hair.  </li>
            <li> this product is a little \\&quot;too light\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> So my little review is just to make you tread with caution, and I hope it helps.</li>
            <li> I had to create a little cocoa butter/ Giovanni product infusion just to keep things balanced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> I can use it everyday for a week with little to no build up</li>
            <li> I am natural 4c hair, this stuff makes my hair sooo manageable its unbelievable!!!</li>
            <li> it just got a bit worse for me actually.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li> I used Giovanni a few times before trying \\&quot;Knot</li>
            <li> MAKES MY HAIR SOO SOFT, AND IT ISN&#x27;T OVERLY EXPENSIVE.</li>
            <li> Moisturizers my 4b hair without leaving it greasy and heavy</li>
            <li> I use it everyday on my 3c/4a hair.</li>
            <li> dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> It completely dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> It also took a while to absorb, so it sat on my hair until my hair dried.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell, but I prefer little smell to fake chemical fragrances!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend sometimes uses it in place of styling gel, to hold his hair in place without being stiff.  </li>
            <li> I guess, it may need to be watered down because it&#x27;s thick.</li>
            <li> This leave in does not weigh my hair down, and on days when I don&#x27;t feel like using styling products I can add some jojoba or coconut oil with this leave in and go!!</li>
            <li> I used very little too, so maybe it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
            <li> Once your hair dries, it leaves my hair heavy and some strands crunchy and hard</li>
            <li> Usually I use a spray moisturizer every day after twisting my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually wear my hair in a bun</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s like a small amount increases as you put it in your head.</li>
            <li> no more crying!  </li>
            <li> (Not sure what type.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t go wrong using it, just need larger quantities.</li>
            <li> I like it because the smell is decent and for the price, the amount I got is not too bad.</li>
            <li> but thankfully it&#x27;s not a strong smell that takes over the bathroom or my house!</li>
            <li> a try.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is cumbersome and a little difficult to get product out as it goes down.</li>
            <li> The scent was absolutely awful, too, which made it all to easy for me to decide to give this away.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for something a little less expensive but it works so I will stay with it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> I wish they made it in a bigger bottle, I go through this stuff like crazy</li>
            <li> I know the formula has now changed, so I guess I am to late.</li>
            <li> It has a thick texture so you will not need a lot.</li>
            <li> Works well for my thick curly hair</li>
            <li> the smell is subtle and i didn&#x27;t smell it on my hair once it was in.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until after I started using Knot Today that I realized this stuff was seriously drying out my hair.</li>
            <li> Its very disappointing because the old formula worked wonders.</li>
            <li> The product is thick and my hair loves it!</li>
            <li> I had to suffer through work all day until I was finally about to come home and scrape that crap out of my hair.</li>
            <li> and my hair was ten times worst.</li>
            <li> Maybe I am using it wrong.....</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I am quite underwhelmed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it does not!  </li>
            <li> Getting a comb through it is impossible.</li>
            <li> The smell (which was the worse aspect for me) is really terrible.</li>
            <li> I noticed my scalp being in chunks of dandruff :(</li>
            <li> YOU WON&#x27;T BE DISAPPOINTED</li>
            <li> I have multi-textured hair and it is annoying.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed and will never buy this item again.  </li>
            <li> and it works terrible for me</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> the product itself is great, but I only received about 3/4 of the product because the bottle was punctured :(</li>
            <li> After 8 months I am still using this conditioner.  It is a wonderful product and I would definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I find that it leaves my hair feeling pretty crI spy afterwards.  But the next day, it is super soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American woman with natural 3c hair with 4a in my crown area...this product is a little \\&quot;too light\\&quot;. Although I do not like my hair to feel greasy or weighed down...this doesn&#x27;t do enough for my curly hair...not a bad product if you have normal or oily hair...but if you have dry curly hair...forget about it....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been \\&quot;natural\\&quot; (my hair is a mix of 3C, 4A and 4B) for a little over 9 months and have tried multiple leave-ins throughout these months and to say that Giovanni&#x27;s Direct Leave-In is the best I have tried would be an understatement. My hair stays soft and moisturized from the time that I put it in my hair early in the morning until I go bed at night. It&#x27;s beyond amazing and I cannot see myself needing to try another leave-in any time soon.</li>
            <li> Our infant daughter is biracial---African american and Caucasian. We wanted a leave-in conditioner to protect her fine, smooth, corkscrew curls from drying out and hair breakage. We strongly prefer organic products and research all ingredients to make an informed purchase. Giovanni Direct Leave In conditioner is great! it is organic, the scent is barely discernible, and a dollop the size of a dime is plenty for her entire head of 5-inch curls. We lightly mist with water, apply Giovanni Direct, comb with wide tooth comb, and do a quick finger twist of curls, ponytails, etc. Her curls dry the slightest bit crunchy, but a light squeeze frees them to a natural bounce. For an organic product the price is great, too! In fact we looked at other Giovanni products and bought some for ourselves. They work great and cost about 25% of what other organics do. Win and win.</li>
            <li> I ended up purchasing this product because I needed something else to make the shipping free.  LOL!  But I am glad that I did.  I had heard wonderful things about it from other websites devoted to African American Naturally Curly/Coily hair and had always thought \\&quot;one day\\&quot; I&#x27;ll check it out and just haven&#x27;t in years I&#x27;ve been natural.  But to the review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied this product to my hair directly after washing and towel drying my hair in sections of four.  I was prepping my hair for 2 strand twist.  As I started to twist, I noticed that this leave in has some great \\&quot;slip\\&quot; to it and it made my hair feel easier to twist.  And the ends of my hair seem to curl around each other a little better which cuts down on the amount of gel I have to use.  My hair felt like it was better moisturized, softer and it smells pretty good too without being overpowering like other products I have used, it&#x27;s light and fresh.  And the consistency is also light, which is a plus for me since my hair is very thick and any damp product in my hair tends to have an extended amount of time to dry.  But the back of my hair was pretty close to dry by the time I was finishing up the front.  I&#x27;ve had my twists in for 2 days now and my hair still feels soft and moisturized even though I haven&#x27;t even sprayed my hair with anything at all.  Usually I use a spray moisturizer every day after twisting my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thoroughly impressed with this product and I actually just looked it up at my local Wal-Mart (because I do not like to depend on products I can&#x27;t get on a whim with a quick trip down the street) to make sure this is a product I will be able to have in supply whenever I need it.</li>
            <li> Words can&#x27;t really describe how much I love this stuff.  I will never stop using it.  I love its light weight texture and the effect it has on my hair.  Leaves my hair moisturized.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for this product much due to the white residue it left in my hair. I&#x27;ve discontinued using this product. Besides as a natural hair girl, I was searching for a product that was all natural or mostly natural and this product does not fit that bill.</li>
            <li> I had ordered a different leave in for $18.00.  It was watery out of the bottle.  The minute I opened the Giovanni, I could tell it was different.  I put it on my natural hair and couldn&#x27;t believe it.  It kept my hair moisturized.  I kept feeling it through the day and sure it enough, it was still soft.  I slept with it and the next day yep, still soft and moisturized.  Before ordering this leave in, my hair was super dry and products would only last for a couple of hours.  I put it in a spray bottle with glycerin, olive oil, and water.  I found my staple!</li>
            <li> Love it. Took it on a beach vacation and everyone who tried it ended up buying it also.Leaves hair soft, shiny and manageable. Hard to find in stores so we just ordered it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Giovanni Direct Leave in Conditioner is the best I have ever used.  I have used this product consistently for four years.  This product arrived quickly at a good price.</li>
            <li> While this product may work well for some, it did not exactly work well for me.  It definitely did help keep more moisture in my hair, but that lasted for only a short time - my hair just didn&#x27;t respond well to this.  The scent was absolutely awful, too, which made it all to easy for me to decide to give this away.  It works all right as a leave-in conditioner, but I think that the scent could definitely be improved upon, because it&#x27;s very strong and absolutely disgusting.</li>
            <li> This product is very moisturizing without being heavy or greasy. It has a light fresh scent. I use it under eco styler gel to combat dryness. It is a great end protectant.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and may be a good product for the right hair type. My hair is really coily, fine, dense, and dry. white clumps and not a good moisturizer</li>
            <li> I bought this on the advice of a friend who heard great things about it. I also saw the reviews and that it was wirth a try.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is cumbersome and a little difficult to get product out as it goes down. The smell (which was the worse aspect for me) is really terrible. If it was just neutral it would be okay but it has this strange unpleasantness to it that had I known I would have left it. The smell does not grow on you it just got a bit worse for me actually. I use it as a leave in after washing and it has not really hardened my hair as mentioned in another comment but it has not reall done much in the way of moistre either. I have been trying a few different products to find one that works for me and had I not spent so much on it (I did not buy on amazon) I would have given it away. But I won&#x27;t let good money go to waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, everyone&#x27;s hair is different and so what does not work for me, may do wonders for you. But I hate when I see all good reviews for a product and try it and it works terrible for me, I wonder didn&#x27;t one other person feel like this? Why didn&#x27;t they leave a review. So my little review is just to make you tread with caution, and I hope it helps.</li>
            <li> I dident know this product at all.I was introduced to it while reading a customer&#x27;s review for another product, and fortunately gave it a try. It is the same exact thing I was looking for .It defines my curles perfectly, no frizz at all and very good volume without heaviness or clumping.The sine is good too.There is nothing left that I expect from a hair product.All done!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Giovanni.Thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am not Anthony I am his wife.  I have used this product for many years and was very pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very curly, coarse, dry hair.  As you may imagaine I was thrilled to find this leave in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the past 6 months I discovered that this product became Eco friendly and no longer hair friendly. I have no idea what they changed but it is no longer something I can use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish that when a product is good they would simply leave it alone.  When I began using the older formula my hair was shiny, soft and managable.  With the current product my hair acts as though I left a big glob of conditioner in it, it is dull and very sticky.  Getting a comb through it is impossible.</li>
            <li> My title says it all.  This product would probably be great for someone that needs less hold/control.&lt;br /&gt;My hair became too big and frizzy when I used it.  I wish it would have worked for me.  I might try another&lt;br /&gt;one of their gels or their other products.</li>
            <li> great moisturizer for your hair gave it a 4 because if you use it with another oil based product it makes your hair white but will disappear within 5 minutes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and fell in love with it. I order this product assuming that I will be getting the exact same product i had. It&#x27;s not the same anymore. They changed the ingredients/formula. Its very disappointing because the old formula worked wonders. The new formula sucks! It doesn&#x27;t detangled nor moisturizer as well...and it seems I have to use a lot more than I have with the old formula. Anyway, if you can find the old formula with (oils) instead of aloe vera gel in the new formula, I highly recommend to buy it! Dont waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li> I am african american with type 4b hair, since this product was great for all hair types i tried it. I washed and conditioned my hair with my own products, then put in the leave in condionter. At first my hair felt smooth but them began klumping up. I let my hair air dry and my hair was ten times worst. It left my extremely knotted, and dry. I usually wear my hair in a bun but that was even a hassel, i just washed the product out.</li>
            <li> was just ok.. not sure what I expected but was like normal conditioner in my hair rather than a leave in-I didnt notice a difference</li>
            <li> I am hispanic with long 2c/3a hair.  The minute I put this product in my hair, It felt so soft and manageable.  The ultimate test was when I had tried a new shampoo and conditioner that left my hair very dry. I put this on after and the dryness was gone.  It is very light weight and didn&#x27;t leave a residue on my hair.  the smell is subtle and i didn&#x27;t smell it on my hair once it was in.  I can&#x27;t wait to try Giovanni&#x27;s other products.  I am very impressed with this product so far!</li>
            <li> this is really good stuff.  I have seen reviews on this on you tube.  I used this and it is great.  I will be ordering more of this.  I am a natural. and my hair is really soft from this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black women who enjoys my hair natural. I heard a lot of hype about this product on youtube and several other blogs that were actually pretty referable. So I gave it a shot. At first it seemed to be making my hair soft, but the next morning, my hair was hard as a rock! I could bearly pull it back in a puff. I had to suffer through work all day until I was finally about to come home and scrape that crap out of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have about 6 inches of hair now after I did the big chop last spring. This has been about the only leave in that does not weigh down my fine hair when I do wash and go style.</li>
            <li> Not a bad moisturizer at all. The container can be better as you have to force the product out each time. The product is better on damp afro hair if you don&#x27;t want any white residue on your hair.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and works great! My only complaint would be that i wish the bottle was bigger, but a little does go a long way. You don&#x27;t really need much of this conditioner in your hair. Also the smell is great :)</li>
            <li> The direct leave-in is very nice and makes your hair feel soft and silky. I like the product, however, I do not like the bottle. Sometimes it squirts out much too fast and it is difficult to open the top and put the extra back in the container.</li>
            <li> My staple/holy grail leave in since I BCd had always been Herbal Essences Long Term Relationship, which worked quite well, but I kept hearing about this product. Leery at first, I eventually decided to try it out after cowashing and before sealing and braiding. I had nice, shiny plump curls and bends the next day, plus the most compliments ever on my hair!!! I was even able to maintain pretty good 2 day hair!! I see what all the fuss is about now ;)</li>
            <li> LOOOOVE this product! My favourite leave in conditioner EVER! I have tried many leave in conditioner but this is the one that I fell in love with. I am a kinki multitextured gal with 4a - 4c hair! The product is thick and my hair loves it! My styles come out better when I use this!</li>
            <li> I love this leave-in. I kept trying different leave-ins hoping to find something by an African-American owned company that I could support, but it&#x27;s a no go. This is the best leave-in I&#x27;ve tried by far. I&#x27;m done searching for others. It is very moisturizing, light, melts in my hair, it&#x27;s a good detangler, fairly priced and smells good. I can also get it at Target and the Vitamin Shoppe, so it&#x27;s readily available.</li>
            <li> You really have to measure out a small amount of this or it will have your hair fully white. I don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s like a small amount increases as you put it in your head. You think that you don&#x27;t have enough and add more only to find out you had more than enough leave-in already. Anyway, other than that, this is an excellent leave in- Detangles excellently.</li>
            <li> I have kinky bohemian curly hair that dries out very quickly. Because I live in a desert climate I am constantly searching for an excellent conditioner. I&#x27;ve used almost every leave-in under the sun, until one day I began to use natural oils (jojoba, coconut)... Love the oils! But I missed the cream consistency for application. I searched on youtube and watched a video by \\&quot;kimmaytube\\&quot; about the ph balance of hair and why the ph balance of your product is so important. After that, I began using a product called \\&quot;knot today\\&quot; and yeah, that stuff works great. There&#x27;s also another product on here called kinky curls or \\&quot;Shea Moisture Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Curl &amp; Hold Smoothie\\&quot;, both, imo, work really well. Thing is, they&#x27;re a little more pricey than this Giovanni product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soooo... until the review: I use this Giovanni product when I want to save money. I&#x27;m big on organic/ natural products with no sulfate. If I knew how to make my own, trust me I would, but until I learn I&#x27;ll be using the consumer ready stuff. I used Giovanni a few times before trying \\&quot;Knot Today\\&quot; and thought it was good. It wasn&#x27;t until after I started using Knot Today that I realized this stuff was seriously drying out my hair. If you read the ingredients, Alcohol is the 4th, meaning it is prevalent amongst the product. In terms of consistency, the cream goes in smooth. I think one of the other reviews said it left white stuff in her hair. I can see that being possible with the thickness. The cream is rich, but because it has alcohol you may find yourself applying more than usual. Yesterday I applied 1/3 the bottle in my hair trying to keep it moisturized, and another 1/3rd in my daughters hair. FYI, my daughters hair has a texture that best resembles Caucasian or Hispanic hair. What I found most annoying was this stuff would dry out after 5 minutes leaving this weird, gooey textured hair, and the more I tried to comb through it the more I felt I was damaging our hair! I had to create a little cocoa butter/ Giovanni product infusion just to keep things balanced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I&#x27;m saying this product is not as natural as it seems, and no leave-in conditioner should have alcohol as the 4th ingredient. Due to the lack of ph compatibility with the hair follicle, you may incur some damage. If you&#x27;re not open to trying the products I mentioned, do yourself a favor and start experimenting with preferences, or at least learn about hair and ph balance. You will save yourself a lot of hair damage, time and $$$ in the future.

            <li> This product is not fully described. It has a lot more ingredients than are listed. There should have been a picture of the BACK of the bottle! It has protein which is something I DIDN&amp;#34;T want. It is NOT weightless or light even. I found it to be as heavy as a regular conditioner and on top of all that it stinks! I like for my hair products to smell nice and this doesn&#x27;t! Really disappointed because I had heard so many great things about this line. I&#x27;m trying to return it so I hope I can get a refund! I will continue to use Neutrogena Triple Moisture Leave in Conditioner which is WONDERFUL and is ALL moisture no protein! I was looking for something a little less expensive but it works so I will stay with it!&lt;br /&gt;I have relaxed hair so the protein/moisture balance is extremely important to reduce breakage and retain length.</li>
            <li> Love this brand a lot, arrived when expected. I wish they made it in a bigger bottle, I go through this stuff like crazy but over all it&#x27;s a very good product, I&#x27;d recommend it!</li>
            <li> Did a fabulous job of conditioning my Black American hair.  I did try it as a leave-In, but there was way too much build up, and I had difficulty combing thru my hair.  So I tried it as a deep conditioner, and it was perfect, just added some grape seed oil to it.  When I purchased this item, I paid $4.83, and currently it is selling for $7.89.  Go figure, I just don&#x27;t understand the wide price fluctuations.</li>
            <li> This is a nice lightweight leave in that products excellent conditioning to hair.  I accidentially purchased 2 bottles and I am glad for my error.  This product does not weigh hair down.&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy with delivery.  Product came fast and was sealed in plastic for safety.</li>
            <li> This used to be a great leave-in conditioner. Now it has been reformalized, with aloe added as the main ingredient.  Aloe is good for many things but hair is not one of them. The main problem, and it&#x27;s a big one, is stickiness.  Weightless it is not. Instead, it is more like free-flowing Crisco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original formula was  identified on the bottle as Pure Organic.  Now it calls itself Eco-Chic, whatever that means.</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS LEAVE IN IT MAKES MY HAIR SOO SOFT, AND IT ISN&#x27;T OVERLY EXPENSIVE. I HAVE A KEEPER.</li>
            <li> I call this &#x27;Magic Hair Cream&#x27;.  My 3 year old cries every time I brush her hair, even straight out of the bath with clean hair.  I tried this and it a miracle - no more crying!  We love this product!!!</li>
            <li> These were a gift. I am unsure as to how well the person likes them.  However, we have not heard anything back from them so we can assume that they are being enjoyed.</li>
            <li> Youtube.com brought me to buy this and so glad I did..  I was watching a video and someone suggested this product...use it all the time!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love it ! Moisturizers my 4b hair without leaving it greasy and heavy</li>
            <li> After reading many highly rated reviews, I had high hopes that this leave-in conditioner would detangle and condition my long fine colored and permed hair.  Unfortunately it does not!  This item looks and feels like moisturizer and doesn&#x27;t detangle, repair, or manage hair.  Once your hair dries, it leaves my hair heavy and some strands crunchy and hard like the look and feel of mousse.  in order to use up the bottle, I now use the rest in the shower and it doesn&#x27;t condition or detangle very well wet either.  I&#x27;m very disappointed and will never buy this item again.  Sticking to my DermaOrganic Intensive Hair Repair Masque.</li>
            <li> This product definitely makes detangling my hair much easier since it gives it plenty of slip. This product is quite light, but it does moisturize to an extent(I guess it depends on your hair type). If you have hair like mine that tends to be dry you&#x27;ll probably need an additional moisturizing product on top of this one.&lt;br /&gt;The smell: to me it smells like a nice cup of tea (I don&#x27;t know what kind but it smells like tea lol!) and the scent is also very light and wears off as your hair dries. As an added bonus, this product is organic and cruelty free!</li>
            <li> I have natural african american hair and this product does wonders. It creates great slip which allows for easy detangling.</li>
            <li> This leave-in is light, yet moisturizing.  It mixes well with any product I&#x27;ve used, with no flakes.  I had heard alot of good things about it and it has lived up to those for me!</li>
            <li> I like this leave-in a lot---it tames freeze and thickens the hair. It does not weigh the hair down much at all. Does not seem to build up on my hair. It appears to enhance my naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> Works as well as more expensive natural leave-in&#x27;s but for less money.  Able to stretch it, also.  It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> This does not help me detangle. It moisturizes okay I guess, it may need to be watered down because it&#x27;s thick. It actually makes my stands stick together and become limp. It smells okay, not sweet or flowery or anything you like your hair to smell like. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again but I gave it three stars bc of the price kuz it&#x27;s way more in stores. Maybe I am using it wrong.....</li>
            <li> I like the feel of it and the nutrients it provides my hair. The only negatives I have are: The smell....not a pleasant scent but thankfully it&#x27;s not a strong smell that takes over the bathroom or my house! I only know the smell because I get a whif while I&#x27;m massaging it into my hair</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reviewing a youtube video for 4a/b hair. It works well as a detangler and moisturizer when used directly  after washing hair with a denman.I would recommend this and definately will purchase again  where the pricing is better.</li>
            <li> Great leave in conditioner for by bi-racial daughter! Her hair is soft but needs a thicker leave-in for moisture. I tried a little in my Caucasian type hair and it left it feeling weighed down. However, I have searched high and low for a good leave in for my daughter and I think I found it!</li>
            <li> I have 4B/4C hair and sometimes I feel I have to do way too much for wash and gos. This product is great as defining curls and leaves your hair feeling soft all day. After cowashing my hair, put some of this on and call it a day! Makes my hair look fabulous. I will purchase the three pack next time!</li>
            <li> Keeps the hair moisturized, easy to apply &amp; smells great. I use it everyday on my 3c/4a hair. Also, fast shipping !!</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair that gets frizzy at the slightest provocation.  When I want to wash-n-go I use this conditioner (sparingly), comb it through, and don&#x27;t worry about my hair the rest of the day.  In addition to helping my hair stay soft and smelling slightly girly (in a good way), my waves remain perfectly preserved throughout the day regardless of the humidity level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little of this product goes a very long way, at least in my hair.  I have long hair and use a squirt between pea- and grape-sized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is attractive, although it can be tricky to get the product out when it runs low in the bottle.  It would be useful to have this in a pump rather than a squeeze bottle.</li>
            <li> never buying this product again. dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> This left my hair pretty sticky and coarse even when it was dry. It didn&#x27;t help detangle it at all.</li>
            <li> I am natural 4c hair, this stuff makes my hair sooo manageable its unbelievable!!! I love that you don&#x27;t need a lot at all, so go easy ladies! I highly suggest purchasing...</li>
            <li> I specifically chose this item and looked at the ingredients before I bought it. I received another that had completely different ingredients on the label. Just be aware that they might send you one with different ingredients!</li>
            <li> Standard is still the same great way.  It provides moisture and manageability after I shampoo and deep condition my hair.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I both use this and love it. It&#x27;s nice to have a good leave-in product without a bunch of nasty chemicals.  My boyfriend sometimes uses it in place of styling gel, to hold his hair in place without being stiff.  It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell, but I prefer little smell to fake chemical fragrances!</li>
            <li> I do the curly girl method and I bought this because it is described as a lightweight leave in. My hair is coarse but very fine, so I can&#x27;t use moisturizing oils or creams - they&#x27;re too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately this is too light and doesn&#x27;t provide enough slip to detangle or keep it untangled,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The search goes on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does smell good. I passed it on to another curly with thicker, less coarse hair and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I have 3c hair and was in need of a leave-in conditioner for my hair. It has a thick texture so you will not need a lot. I</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a wk now and Im pleased but I wanted a lil more. Giovanni is an excellent product if you want NATURAL, but as far as moisturizing, which is what I wanted Its ok, explains the 4 stars. EverybodieS hair is different and mine is typical right on the verge of being dry. TO ME ITS BETTER AS A PRE WASH. As far as shipping it took my product about a wk to get here so the site was pretty accurate. Im satisfied I guess.</li>
            <li> African american mom with natural daughter different but similar textures works greatvu dont need a lotvand very ligt smells great</li>
            <li> My hair had become so dry and brittle from fun in the sun that I couldn&#x27;t even get a comb through it. Now I carry this with me to apply after beach time. Works great!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t use it with other products</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so soft. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and will use it for years to come.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner, I use this with Castor oil, jojoba oil and Aloe vera juice to make the kimmaytube leave-in conditioner. The Recipe is as follows: 2 Tbsp Leave-In Conditioner&lt;br /&gt;2 Tbsp Aloe Vera Juice&lt;br /&gt;2 Tsp Jojoba Oil&lt;br /&gt;2 Tsp Castor Oi&lt;br /&gt;This is great if you experience trouble retaining moisture. It has a slightly acidic ph which is best for hair. With or without additions Giovanni is my staple conditioner and I couldn&#x27;t go without it for long. Many of my friends love it too.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel nice.</li>
            <li> good product, but I have discovered an even better leave-in for curly hair. Its called curls unleashed organic root stimulator :)</li>
            <li> This leave-in does the job on natural hair. Softens while is conditions.  Keeps hair manageable, I love it so far.</li>
            <li> One of the best leave in conditioners. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this leave in conditioner. I have 3c hair and it worked great, better that Kinky Curly leave in. I had less breakeage and it helped with detangling. The smell is light which is great. Overall im satisfied. This is my staple leave-in conditioner now.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes curly hair very well and leaves hair feeling soft without drying or leaving a heavy buildup. Leaves no residue.</li>
            <li> Works good as a leave in conditioner. I like the feeling it leaves in my hair. Doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy residue, and makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone natural.I have 4c hair. This seems to work pretty well in my hair. I haven&#x27;t tried any other leave in conditioner at this point since this one seems to be working.</li>
            <li> You can buy this same sized product at vitacost.com for $4.87. Why are you paing more for the same item?</li>
            <li> I honestly like the product just ran out too fast for me. I blame the bottle shape.  Going back to my old conditioner...</li>
            <li> Great product for my natural hair. It&#x27;s light &amp; doesn&#x27;t flake or leave white stuff in my head when paired with my gel. I got it at a great price too. Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling really soft. My hair is natural and it makes it feel really nice. I would recommed this to my friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American woman that recently went from relaxed to natural hair, so I&#x27;ve been experimenting with products that will keep my hair moisturized and this, along with the Giovanni Smooth as Silk conditioner and shampoo, and the VitaPro fusion treatment seems to help a lot!</li>
            <li> This product is probably great but it is not for me. It completely dried out my hair. I have natural, course hair (dreadlocks, actually) and this was a pretty big mistake for me. Glad I only ordered one bottle and not a 3 set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American with natural hair (Not sure what type. Can&#x27;t figure nor am I too stressed with the whole type thing...lol) I know the formula has now changed, so I guess I am to late. I saw so many reviews on this product that was saying wonderful things prior to the formula change. I think it is OK...nothing to brag about. I think it sort of suds up after putting in hair when wet. Better to use with dry hair.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time on my natural hair. It works great and is a great Detangler! Will buy more in the future!</li>
            <li> Not bad as far as product goes. I like it because the smell is decent and for the price, the amount I got is not too bad. I have seen this product numerous times on natural blogs and I have to say I agree with most reviews. Its lightweight and moisturizing and is quickly becoming a go to product for me. I can use it everyday for a week with little to no build up so I definitely recommend it. I just don&#x27;t know how much good it will do for me long term yet.</li>
            <li> Detangles, moisturizers, does not weigh hair down. I also mix it with a little water and use it to moisturize my ends and seal with jojoba oil and my hair stays soft all day!</li>
            <li> I have really frizzy mixed hair that I usually wear curly, and this product kept my curls looking nice and smooth for days. It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair at all, no matter how much I use.</li>
            <li> I have read many blogs on which people rave about this product, especially for curly hair. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get to Whole Foods to buy the Direct Leave-In along with Smooth as Silk shampoo and conditioner. Unfortunately, I am quite underwhelmed. I find the Direct Leave-In to be too light for my hair. It also took a while to absorb, so it sat on my hair until my hair dried. Not cool. No one likes to walk around looking like they didn&#x27;t properly rub the product into their hair. This could be because I used more leave-in than I normally use since this product is not as thick as my usual leave-in. I hope other reviewers have a better experience, but I will not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with this product. I&#x27;ve been doing the natural hair thing for a few months now and it&#x27;s so hard&lt;br /&gt;to keep the hair moisturized and most products on the market today have entirely too many chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;I heard about Giovanni from other natural women on YouTube so I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical at first but I must say, I was pleasantly surprised once I used it.&lt;br /&gt;I used it on wet hair the first couple of times and it did not work that great but when I&lt;br /&gt;tried it on dry hair, it made my hair sooo soft and detangled.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure it isn&#x27;t the absolute BEST product in the world but for now, this is the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for at least two years and love it! It only takes a small amount, which I rub all through my just washed hair.  It leaves my hair feeling soft and it has a nice fragrance-nothing overpowering.</li>
            <li> This light leave-in conditioner keeps my natural hair thoroughly moisturized, and is light enough to not over power my styling products. This leave in does not weigh my hair down, and on days when I don&#x27;t feel like using styling products I can add some jojoba or coconut oil with this leave in and go!! It&#x27;s amazing, and a staple product of mine!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even use it because it foams for me.  First miss from Giovanni.</li>
            <li> Very light weight and leaves my curls fluffy and soft. I use it right after a wash for flat twist outs and Bantu knot outs.</li>
            <li> The product is very lite weight and works well in my children&#x27;s hair. My hair is a little more dense and I don&#x27;t really care for it in mone. Leaves the kidd hair soft and manageable</li>
            <li> It does moisturize your hair well. Maybe a little heavy, but I could be using too much. I&#x27;ll play around with the amount, but if you want moisture this product does the job. Also, it make your hair really soft.</li>
            <li> Good product. Smells great. Conditions nicely and softens. Also helps with detangling. Good leave in for all seasons. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Seems like my hair is more greasy in using this product. I used it after shampooing; tried it several times with the same result.&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Okay. I don&#x27;t use it very much for my hair. Found other products to be more fitting since I have gone natural.</li>
            <li> I buy this on amazon when I can&#x27;t find it in the store. I love that it&#x27;s more natural than other conditioners, it provides great slip for detangling and a nice hit of protein for your hair. The bottle lasts me a while too.</li>
            <li> When I received my bottle I decided to go through  a series of 3 times a week wash, deep conditioning and leave in for a month. I noticed my scalp being in chunks of dandruff :( overall it defines my curls but leaves my scalp extremely itchy!!!</li>
            <li> i LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS LEAVE IN. FIRST IT SOFTENS HAIR AND IT SMELLS AMAZING. AFTER USING IT ONE TIME I NOTICE MY HAIR WAS WAY SOFT. LOVE IT AND A LITTLE OF THE PRODUCT GOES A LONG WAY. IT BEST TO USE ON TOWEL DRY HAIR. GET  IT  YOU WON&#x27;T BE DISAPPOINTED</li>
            <li> I am an African American with 4b/c hair. I like this product when I mix it with castor oil and olive oil in my hand. It makes my hair soft and defines my curls a little.</li>
            <li> i started making the Kimmaytube conditioner which wins every time. I have gone back to trusty giovanni direct but you know what? It is not as shiny and soft as with Kimmaytube&#x27;s recipe on my 4a/b hair . However if you are a newly natural, this is a trusty cannot go wrong product that is inexpensive and gives excellent results. It can also be found at any local health food store.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a product that really does moisturize my hair. I have multi-textured hair and it is annoying.  Water and oil doesn&#x27;t moisturize it. By the end of the day, my hair is usually dry as a bone. This is the first product I have found that leaves my hair feeling soft, and not dry and oily at the end of the day. I have been using it for a week and so far its been good. When I use this I still use a natural Shea butter mixture with it and my hair does not end up being oily and dry. Yay Giovanni Direct leave In! I don&#x27;t understand how it works but I am glad it does.</li>
            <li> It does what its supposed to, it conditions my hair and my hair is left feeling moisturized days after using the product.&lt;br /&gt;i will continue to purchase this item.</li>
            <li> This is another great product from Giovanni Cosmetics, There whole product line is awesome, I&#x27;ve never had so many AWESOME hair days. I just putA  some on after washing my hair follow it with their volume boost , takes me 4 mins and my hair looks amazingly healthy , light , and bouncy...You never get that combination with many other leave in conditioners. The prime reason I found about this is because they ARE A CRUELTY FREE COMPANY , Lets keep supporting these companies not only are they being compassionate and socially responsible but they are creating high quality products!</li>
            <li> I order this product in hopes of getting something better then my \\&quot;Shea Butter\\&quot; leave in. It was not, I&#x27;m not saying this is not a good product, but my natural hair response better to \\&quot;Shea Butter\\&quot; products. So now I know!</li>
            <li> This product is living up to my expectations. A lightweight leave in which firms the hair and allows for manageability without weighting down my shaft. I would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and affordable. Great slip and soft hold for all styles. I would buy this again  because i really like it</li>
            <li> The shipment was sent quickly and was a good price.  I am very happy with the product, it works well for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this item due to the million reviews I Read on naturallycurly.com and the reviews in other places. I can say this product has provided me with soft, fluffy, and moisturized hair for 2-3 days!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 4A natural hair and this product is the BUSINESS!! Won&#x27;t go wrong using it, just need larger quantities.</li>
            <li> Like many others with very curly hair, I&#x27;ve sworn off shampoo, using this in its place and again as a conditioner. It does nice thing for my hair and is quite inexpensive. I find the fragrance pleasant and not overbearing and like the flip top container as well</li>
            <li> People rave about this stuff but for me it weighed my hair down and left a white cast. Massaging and brushing the hair for 10 minutes helped it disappear. I used very little too, so maybe it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
            <li> I use this every time i wash a co wash an it works great, not sticky doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel heavy, leaves it very light, smells nice, i recommend to anyone who is natural an needs a too leave-in for dry hair.</li>
            <li> Love it, makes my kinky hair manageable, bought a bigger one after i finished this one. Try it, you will love it</li>
            <li> I have wavy, fine, shoulder length, dirty-blonde hair that is just more stubborn than I am. I&#x27;ve tried lots of different avenues to try and tame this mane with my scrunch and air dry routine - deep conditioners, moisturizing shampoo and conditioner duos, leave ins, argan oil, hair oil, pequi oil, etc, and this is my favorite. It&#x27;s surprisingly light in my fine hair and gives me that day after shampoo look I love on the first day, taming flyways and locking in moisture and shine -plus the day after still looks good. Versatile as well - you can layer it on overnight for a deep treatment and my hubbs uses it to shave :)</li>
            <li> Fantastic leave-in conditioner</li>
            <li> Amazing leave in conditioner. I already tried Giovanni products before so I knew this wouldn&#x27;t let me down. I have  long thick afro-american type hair lol So yes, this can work on our hair too lol</li>
            <li> It was recommended by a contributor to YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;Works just as described.  I absolutely love this leave-in conditioner. It is the best.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is inexpensive so you really don&#x27;t have to order it online. I would recommend it to all who wear their hair natural.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair very dry, did not add any moisture to my hair.  I will not be using it again.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Works well for my thick curly hair</li>
            <li> I find that this conditioner gives my hair a soft, shiny look yet it keeps my hair controlled without being greasy .</li>
            <li> I love the light weight feel of this product. It leaves the hair moisturized without making it feel greasy.  I really LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> My mom likes this product so every once and awhile I pick up a bottle for her. She seems to make it last a long time.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for the first time and my hair which is normally coarse and dry felt amazing! It was soft and easy to come. I have only tried it once, I can&#x27;t wait to see how it works in the long term.</li>
            <li> My hair has a boyfriend! This stuff is perfect! I have 4a/4b medium length natural hair. I use it on wet, damp, and dry hair.</li>
