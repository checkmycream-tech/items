    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>However, that said, the best thing about an eye serum truly shouldn&#x27;t be how it smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I am impressed with the quality of this product.</li>
            <li>They are the best products for unruly or damaged hair.  </li>
            <li>Absorption into the skin and the tightening effect is incredible.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Phyto 5 eye serum for a couple of weeks now and am happy with how the serum works.  </li>
            <li>The Phyto 5 Ageless Eye Serum is pleasant to use, and it smooths and tightens the under-eye area.</li>
            <li>The serum feels good on my face and seems to have a bit of a tightening effect on my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, but</li>
            <li>not THAT good.</li>
            <li>does it smell good?</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, does it feel good?</li>
            <li>it smell good?</li>
            <li>Did it feel good?</li>
            <li>Smell good?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve laughed a lot, I&#x27;ve cried a lot, and that is going to take its toll in lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li>, honestly I don&#x27;t find it pleasant</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not bashing the product, but I just LOVE the scent!</li>
            <li>It feels great going on and remains comfortable.</li>
            <li>She applies it twice a day and it has amazing effect.</li>
            <li>I just didn&#x27;t see anything spectacular with it either.</li>
            <li>Just nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li>Your own aesthetics will have to inform you whether or not this product is for you.</li>
            <li>I liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going to say that this is a nice splurgey product,</li>
            <li>/&gt;Application is lovely: it has a nice texture and smells nice as well.</li>
            <li>Rose Oil and Rose Water are included in many products including perfume as well as tonics taken orally.</li>
            <li>Well, I appreciate the commitment to plant-based ingredients (95% is pretty good!), but I&#x27;m a bit concerned that it contains Sodium Hydroxide (lye).</li>
            <li>You might want to look for a more cost effective solution.</li>
            <li>It looks kind of shiny unless you put makeup on top of it</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a lovely experience but has not (yet) shown us the kind of performance that would prompt my wife to purchase more.</li>
            <li>The serum is made partly from rose petals, and smells strongly of roses.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t feel like I had some huge, &amp;#34;WOW!  </li>
            <li>This was an okay product.</li>
            <li>I am fairly pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>What I love most about this eye serum is it&#x27;s scent.</li>
            <li>I ask: are my eyes more &amp;#34;radiant, hydrated and youthful&amp;#34; as this product claims?</li>
            <li>Makeup can be applied over the top of it if you wish, or you can go out with just the serum.</li>
            <li>I found it to be refreshing and soothing at the end of the day when I readied myself before bed.</li>
            <li>Better than a cucumber wash.</li>
            <li>Even my favorite eye cream by La Mer doesn&#x27;t touch them, but I hoped a serum that claimed to help might do just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe for others whose circles aren&#x27;t genetic (as I assume mine are) would have better luck.</li>
            <li>Well, mostly supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>Maybe you need more wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This serum has something women love: results.</li>
            <li>it contain ingredients I&#x27;m ok with having on my face?</li>
            <li>and I look better</li>
            <li>I think my eye area looks my age, and to some degree I&#x27;m okay with that.  </li>
            <li>some report greater benefits might be derived from making sure the amino acid</li>
            <li>now it feels like more of a preventative measure than a restorative one.</li>
            <li>so there&#x27;s not much to fix, but for her, while it was a very pleasant experience with a nice temporary effect, there did not seem to be any permanent line reduction over time.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any huge difference that this serum has made, but will continue to use it to see if there are better results after just 3 weeks of use, and will update here.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also happy this doesn&#x27;t cause any reaction in my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>First off, many products like this bother my skin, kind of a stinging sensation.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a gentle rose fragrance that I very much enjoyed, although a neighbor who tried this out described it as &amp;#34;too perfumey&amp;#34; for them, so your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li>Another featured ingredient, Beech Tree Bud Extract, contains hydroxyproline, which is claimed to encourage production of collagen, the lattice that keeps skin taunt and so reduce the appearance of fine lines.</li>
            <li>I did not see a huge difference in my crows feet however.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s nice to use, and not irritating, but just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, without an odor and does not irritate or make my eyes water.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll say that when this dries it leaves a light shiny sheen.  </li>
            <li>My wife says the serum is light weight and the effects are felt immediately.</li>
            <li>It has a rose scent which I don&#x27;t really care for</li>
            <li>does it contain ingredients I&#x27;m comfortable with having on my face?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>With that said, I was excited to try the eye serum.  </li>
            <li>In general, I tend to review them like this: does it feel good?</li>
            <li>a familiar smell that I cant place</li>
            <li>It dissipates quickly, so it may not be a huge issue even for someone who doesn&#x27;t care for it, but at this price point, you might want to test it out in a store before you order it online scent unsmelled.</li>
            <li>It has a light fragrance of roses, which dissipates fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>The serum itself is light and applies well to the skin, but when it dries, it leaves a film on the surface of the skin rather than being absorbed.</li>
            <li>given it almost the full 30 days</li>
            <li>I had no bad reactions to this Serum.  </li>
            <li>Comes in an easy to use bottle and smells of Rose essential oil.</li>
            <li>The compact pump dispenser is quick and easy, but use the pump with a light touch to avoid dispensing too much product.</li>
            <li>So, while the formulation is good for sensitive skin, and the sensations are pleasant, the effects are minimal, at least for her very fair skin.</li>
            <li>This is also the reason for the 3 star rating, I feel I should give it a little more time to be fair.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and most eye creams irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>I especially like the container it comes in and the easy dispensing top.</li>
            <li>I have Rose essential oil that I paid a lot of money for</li>
            <li>But it was worth the try.</li>
            <li>It does seem to tighten up the saggy skin and help with the old under eye bags, which I love.  </li>
            <li>but then that absorbed.  </li>
            <li>I really cant say it&#x27;s done much to make my skin look any more youthful either.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t sting or have any fumes or vapors that bug my eyes, though there is a floral fragrance that fades pretty quickly on application.</li>
            <li>and I really cant see any significant difference on my eyes, or my bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However, it is wonderful for getting rid of puffiness, dark circles, and minor lines.</li>
            <li>and they smell exactly alike</li>
            <li>First I want to state that I have been using Phyto hair care products for years.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps, as another reviewer pointed out, was the skin looser and/or creased with more lines, there would have been a lasting change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There might be a tiny bit more moisture in the skin on days when I use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even after the first use.</li>
            <li>first the serum doesn&#x27;t seem to work</li>
            <li>I tried this, without real high expectations.  </li>
            <li>It is rich in vitamins, is a natural anti-inflammatory and is said to promote healing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely not left with skin that&#x27;s any more &amp;#34;radiant, hydrated and youthful,&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;more supple and luminous.&amp;#34; For the price, I&#x27;d expect a whole lot</li>
            <li>it make you look younger?&amp;#34;) is pretty much always</li>
            <li>The funny part is that I really didn&#x27;t think I needed any toning-but lo and behold-I can use a bit.</li>
            <li>The serum has a very strong scent when first applied, but it dissipates within a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>So you have to wash your face then put this on and then wait till it drys really well before applying makeup.</li>
            <li>I really like this and will buy it again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, this may be a function of my wife&#x27;s eyes having only light lines</li>
            <li>A real firming and tightening of the skin under the eyes could be felt, so I like this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I haven&#x27;t noticed that it really does anything noticeable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a natural scent, not artificial, but if you&#x27;re not a fan of roses, this might be an issue.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see any difference in my skin when I wash it off</li>
            <li>ask these questions because the answer to the *real* question (&amp;#34;Does</li>
            <li>Not contain too much toxic grossness.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t seem to be getting very noticeable results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a kind of gel, very heavily scented of rosewater (which I happen to like, but be aware).</li>
            <li>The scent was mild and not unpleasant, and the product absorbed quickly, but there was no apparent tightening (although in fairness, there is not much need for any).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll also need to report back later after a more extended use to give it a fair evaluation due to the incremental and gradual change of any skin nutritional product that only occurs over time.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s derived from is sufficiently present in your diet, though deficiencies are rare and it&#x27;s important to consume amino acids in their proper ratios so oral  </li>
            <li>Just be aware that you&#x27;ll have to apply any subsequent makeup very gently.</li>
            <li>Older gal here.</li>
            <li>Three weeks is a bare minimum to report on any noticeable difference in skin composition, and I can only thus far say the serum is refreshing, does help reduce puffiness and has a tightening feel.</li>
            <li>little goes a long way, so that&#x27;s good, but as far as it absorbing into my skin, I found that it didn&#x27;t very well.</li>
            <li>I would like to give this a little more time to see &amp;#34;noticeable&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>so it does make this appear a little better</li>
            <li>That said, I had no negative reactions to the ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once applied, it does have a nice tightening effect that lasts for a few hours, though it has not, as of yet, provided any long term positive</li>
            <li>really like this product but am hesitant to give it five stars because of the high price and the fact that it won&#x27;t really improve deep crows feet.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like to leave a negative review on a product from a company that I love, but there you have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to scented products, but this serum works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I eat very healthy, the puffiness remains, although some days it is worse than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure I will ever be able to rationalize the price, though, as this is spendy stuff.</li>
            <li>As you might guess, rose oil is produced from rose pedals, requiring a large quantity of flowers for a small quantity of oil, making pure oil very expensive to produce.</li>
            <li>This eye serum has a faint pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>Maybe worth a try if you have loose skin and want the tightening feature.</li>
            <li>The Algenist does a good job of taking care of small crows feet and mild puffiness, but I haven&#x27;t yet found anything to combat the dark circles (other than sleep).</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with how my skin did not feel tight but visibly looked flatter and less puffy.</li>
            <li>This serum hasn&#x27;t helped with either so far.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for a month and haven&#x27;t noticed much difference, maybe it will show improvement in my eyes bags latter?</li>
            <li>After about 5 days of use the firmness around my half-century old (plus) eyes is noticeable.</li>
            <li>My wife has particularly sensitive skin, and has difficulty finding cosmetics and skin care products that don&#x27;t cause irritation or even rashes.  </li>
            <li>The skin under my eyes looks pretty much exactly the same as it does on the days I&#x27;ve forgotten to put this on, with the possible exception noted above</li>
            <li>It has a firming action that is noticeable for hours after application.</li>
            <li>am 40 years old and do a lot of laughing</li>
            <li>will take a before picture and continue using it until the bottle is empty, if there is anything worth posting</li>
            <li>It is thick and the pump will pump too much out with one full pump so a half pump is about right.</li>
            <li>serum, at least, is different from most eye-area moisturizer.</li>
            <li>the laugh lines are less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The major problem I have with this product is it is sticky.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m starting to get some laugh lines but not too bad.&lt;br /&gt;The product goes on clear and leaves a slight film</li>
            <li>I gave it only 3 stars because the effect was at most subtle considering the premium cost.  </li>
            <li>In theory, it tightens, but apparently my skin doesn&#x27;t benefit from this</li>
            <li>I was skeptical,so when I took a bit of the clear serum from the simple applicator container I used it under my eyes and above near the brow.</li>
            <li>They may have been minimally improved but were still very visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>serum is fairly thick and rich for a serum (which I like), rather than watery like others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It just takes a slight push on the top to get out just the small amount that a I need.  </li>
            <li>I have used an eye product for at least 10 years, and this is the first one that I have used that does not seem to absorb into the skin, no matter how long you gently pat or rub it in.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also got sensitive skin not only because it&#x27;s dry but because I have a slew of allergies.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s because my wife&#x27;s eyes are only 45 years old and not 65, but this product had limited appeal</li>
            <li>It does make the skin around my eyes feel tightened so it does have a very limited effect on the skin as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am happy with the moisturizing effect of this serum, but am a little disappointed that it hasn&#x27;t done anything to remove the dark circles under my eyes or reduce the wrinkles under my eyes when I smile.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> some report greater benefits might be derived from making sure the amino acid</li>
            <li> now it feels like more of a preventative measure than a restorative one.</li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s not much to fix, but for her, while it was a very pleasant experience with a nice temporary effect, there did not seem to be any permanent line reduction over time.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any huge difference that this serum has made, but will continue to use it to see if there are better results after just 3 weeks of use, and will update here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also happy this doesn&#x27;t cause any reaction in my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> First off, many products like this bother my skin, kind of a stinging sensation.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a gentle rose fragrance that I very much enjoyed, although a neighbor who tried this out described it as &amp;#34;too perfumey&amp;#34; for them, so your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li> Another featured ingredient, Beech Tree Bud Extract, contains hydroxyproline, which is claimed to encourage production of collagen, the lattice that keeps skin taunt and so reduce the appearance of fine lines.</li>
            <li> I did not see a huge difference in my crows feet however.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s nice to use, and not irritating, but just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, without an odor and does not irritate or make my eyes water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll say that when this dries it leaves a light shiny sheen.  </li>
            <li> My wife says the serum is light weight and the effects are felt immediately.</li>
            <li> It has a rose scent which I don&#x27;t really care for</li>
            <li> does it contain ingredients I&#x27;m comfortable with having on my face?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> With that said, I was excited to try the eye serum.  </li>
            <li> In general, I tend to review them like this: does it feel good?</li>
            <li> a familiar smell that I cant place</li>
            <li> It dissipates quickly, so it may not be a huge issue even for someone who doesn&#x27;t care for it, but at this price point, you might want to test it out in a store before you order it online scent unsmelled.</li>
            <li> It has a light fragrance of roses, which dissipates fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> The serum itself is light and applies well to the skin, but when it dries, it leaves a film on the surface of the skin rather than being absorbed.</li>
            <li> given it almost the full 30 days</li>
            <li> I had no bad reactions to this Serum.  </li>
            <li> Comes in an easy to use bottle and smells of Rose essential oil.</li>
            <li> The compact pump dispenser is quick and easy, but use the pump with a light touch to avoid dispensing too much product.</li>
            <li> So, while the formulation is good for sensitive skin, and the sensations are pleasant, the effects are minimal, at least for her very fair skin.</li>
            <li> This is also the reason for the 3 star rating, I feel I should give it a little more time to be fair.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and most eye creams irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> I especially like the container it comes in and the easy dispensing top.</li>
            <li> I have Rose essential oil that I paid a lot of money for</li>
            <li> But it was worth the try.</li>
            <li> It does seem to tighten up the saggy skin and help with the old under eye bags, which I love.  </li>
            <li> but then that absorbed.  </li>
            <li> I really cant say it&#x27;s done much to make my skin look any more youthful either.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t sting or have any fumes or vapors that bug my eyes, though there is a floral fragrance that fades pretty quickly on application.</li>
            <li> and I really cant see any significant difference on my eyes, or my bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However, it is wonderful for getting rid of puffiness, dark circles, and minor lines.</li>
            <li> and they smell exactly alike</li>
            <li> First I want to state that I have been using Phyto hair care products for years.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps, as another reviewer pointed out, was the skin looser and/or creased with more lines, there would have been a lasting change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There might be a tiny bit more moisture in the skin on days when I use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even after the first use.</li>
            <li> first the serum doesn&#x27;t seem to work</li>
            <li> I tried this, without real high expectations.  </li>
            <li> It is rich in vitamins, is a natural anti-inflammatory and is said to promote healing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely not left with skin that&#x27;s any more &amp;#34;radiant, hydrated and youthful,&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;more supple and luminous.&amp;#34; For the price, I&#x27;d expect a whole lot</li>
            <li> it make you look younger?&amp;#34;) is pretty much always</li>
            <li> The funny part is that I really didn&#x27;t think I needed any toning-but lo and behold-I can use a bit.</li>
            <li> The serum has a very strong scent when first applied, but it dissipates within a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> So you have to wash your face then put this on and then wait till it drys really well before applying makeup.</li>
            <li> I really like this and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, this may be a function of my wife&#x27;s eyes having only light lines</li>
            <li> A real firming and tightening of the skin under the eyes could be felt, so I like this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I haven&#x27;t noticed that it really does anything noticeable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a natural scent, not artificial, but if you&#x27;re not a fan of roses, this might be an issue.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see any difference in my skin when I wash it off</li>
            <li> ask these questions because the answer to the *real* question (&amp;#34;Does</li>
            <li> Not contain too much toxic grossness.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t seem to be getting very noticeable results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a kind of gel, very heavily scented of rosewater (which I happen to like, but be aware).</li>
            <li> The scent was mild and not unpleasant, and the product absorbed quickly, but there was no apparent tightening (although in fairness, there is not much need for any).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll also need to report back later after a more extended use to give it a fair evaluation due to the incremental and gradual change of any skin nutritional product that only occurs over time.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s derived from is sufficiently present in your diet, though deficiencies are rare and it&#x27;s important to consume amino acids in their proper ratios so oral  </li>
            <li> Just be aware that you&#x27;ll have to apply any subsequent makeup very gently.</li>
            <li> Older gal here.</li>
            <li> Three weeks is a bare minimum to report on any noticeable difference in skin composition, and I can only thus far say the serum is refreshing, does help reduce puffiness and has a tightening feel.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way, so that&#x27;s good, but as far as it absorbing into my skin, I found that it didn&#x27;t very well.</li>
            <li> I would like to give this a little more time to see &amp;#34;noticeable&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> so it does make this appear a little better</li>
            <li> That said, I had no negative reactions to the ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once applied, it does have a nice tightening effect that lasts for a few hours, though it has not, as of yet, provided any long term positive</li>
            <li> really like this product but am hesitant to give it five stars because of the high price and the fact that it won&#x27;t really improve deep crows feet.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like to leave a negative review on a product from a company that I love, but there you have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to scented products, but this serum works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I eat very healthy, the puffiness remains, although some days it is worse than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure I will ever be able to rationalize the price, though, as this is spendy stuff.</li>
            <li> As you might guess, rose oil is produced from rose pedals, requiring a large quantity of flowers for a small quantity of oil, making pure oil very expensive to produce.</li>
            <li> This eye serum has a faint pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> Maybe worth a try if you have loose skin and want the tightening feature.</li>
            <li> The Algenist does a good job of taking care of small crows feet and mild puffiness, but I haven&#x27;t yet found anything to combat the dark circles (other than sleep).</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with how my skin did not feel tight but visibly looked flatter and less puffy.</li>
            <li> This serum hasn&#x27;t helped with either so far.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for a month and haven&#x27;t noticed much difference, maybe it will show improvement in my eyes bags latter?</li>
            <li> After about 5 days of use the firmness around my half-century old (plus) eyes is noticeable.</li>
            <li> My wife has particularly sensitive skin, and has difficulty finding cosmetics and skin care products that don&#x27;t cause irritation or even rashes.  </li>
            <li> The skin under my eyes looks pretty much exactly the same as it does on the days I&#x27;ve forgotten to put this on, with the possible exception noted above</li>
            <li> It has a firming action that is noticeable for hours after application.</li>
            <li> am 40 years old and do a lot of laughing</li>
            <li> will take a before picture and continue using it until the bottle is empty, if there is anything worth posting</li>
            <li> It is thick and the pump will pump too much out with one full pump so a half pump is about right.</li>
            <li> serum, at least, is different from most eye-area moisturizer.</li>
            <li> the laugh lines are less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The major problem I have with this product is it is sticky.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m starting to get some laugh lines but not too bad.&lt;br /&gt;The product goes on clear and leaves a slight film</li>
            <li> I gave it only 3 stars because the effect was at most subtle considering the premium cost.  </li>
            <li> In theory, it tightens, but apparently my skin doesn&#x27;t benefit from this</li>
            <li> I was skeptical,so when I took a bit of the clear serum from the simple applicator container I used it under my eyes and above near the brow.</li>
            <li> They may have been minimally improved but were still very visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> serum is fairly thick and rich for a serum (which I like), rather than watery like others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It just takes a slight push on the top to get out just the small amount that a I need.  </li>
            <li> I have used an eye product for at least 10 years, and this is the first one that I have used that does not seem to absorb into the skin, no matter how long you gently pat or rub it in.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also got sensitive skin not only because it&#x27;s dry but because I have a slew of allergies.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because my wife&#x27;s eyes are only 45 years old and not 65, but this product had limited appeal</li>
            <li> It does make the skin around my eyes feel tightened so it does have a very limited effect on the skin as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am happy with the moisturizing effect of this serum, but am a little disappointed that it hasn&#x27;t done anything to remove the dark circles under my eyes or reduce the wrinkles under my eyes when I smile.</li>
            <li> and my trouble spots are dark circles under my eyes and under eye wrinkles when I smile.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to heavy cloying floral fragrances, and this is definitely not that.</li>
            <li> I have dry, older mom skin but not a huge amount of wrinkles around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> It has a different feel to it than other under eye moisturizers I have used and lasts the entire day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She was very pleased to find that this Eye Serum caused her no trouble, but was disappointed to find little in the way of noticeable results.  </li>
            <li> I also am not wild about he scent, but that is minor.  </li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes instantly felt tighter and after a few minutes, I was pleasantly surprised to see my regular dark circles under my eyes were almost gone.  </li>
            <li> In view of the included ingredients that was not unexpected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick translucent gel, and it spreads on very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no tightening, no smoothing, and I definitely don&#x27;t notice any change in the dark circles.</li>
            <li> but a little goes a long way so it will last a while.</li>
            <li> It is also such a small amount that if you used it daily and then at night you would need another bottle in a month or so.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t speak to long term use yet, since I&#x27;ve only had the serum a few days now.  </li>
            <li> When I do this, I must be very very careful to barely touch the area, since the eye serum tends to roll off, the way dead skin rolls off.  </li>
            <li> However it does seem to irritate my eyes a little which is why I started only applying it when i was going to sleep at night.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are careful you can cover this with powder.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not really a value given the lack of results I saw after a month or using it.</li>
            <li> A little seems to go a long way.</li>
            <li> And be very careful not to depress the dispenser pump all the way, since it will give you a dollop that would cover your entire face at least.  </li>
            <li> I have used other eye serums in the past and the Phyto 5 is the only one that seems to have an all day moisturizing</li>
            <li> /&gt;The other reason for the 2 stars is the cost.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It left a little sticky residue for a few minutes</li>
            <li> It makes me feel like my eyes are being protected from the harsh dry air throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> but I do have lines under my eyes that bother me and make me look old and tired.</li>
            <li> It lays on the surface, and dries to a slightly tacky shiny finish.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance doesn&#x27;t bother me, although it is a little odd.</li>
            <li> This eye serum has helped a little.</li>
            <li> So I decided to put it on before my makeup and that didn&#x27;t work for me either because it was a little crusty</li>
            <li> You do not need but a little dab on your fingers for use on both eyes.</li>
            <li> but it does hide the lines a little.</li>
            <li> My eyes are a little saggy</li>
            <li> and it does hide the lines a little under my eyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I did notice that if I rubbed my eye area, like when putting on some concealer or something, the dried serum would come off in little pills and clumps.</li>
            <li> Like putting too much lotion on dirty skin and all your dead skin comes off and flakes heavy</li>
            <li> I would advise waiting a few minutes to apply eye makeup after using this product.  </li>
            <li> a few minutes after applying it, the skin around my eyes does feel like it has tightened up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;That doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m not interested in my eyes looking younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also is a little too thick.</li>
            <li> It absorbs a little slowly, but doesn&#x27;t leave the skin tacky or with any residue.</li>
            <li> It reduced the puffiness of my eyes and some small wrinkles under my eye were minimized.  </li>
            <li> eye cream has some perfume aroma but it is not overwhelming, and I like</li>
            <li> (and I&#x27;m not faithful about using it morning and evening, as instructed, but I&#x27;m usually using it at least in the morning)</li>
            <li> so really hard to say if it works on the puffiness because it is not immediate but the lines around my eyes are not noticeable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m having a hard time telling if there has been any change at all.</li>
            <li> It does tighten the skin under your eye, but does nothing for puffiness, and costs a fortune, so use your common sense.</li>
            <li> I have fairly bad puffiness below my eyes and although I&#x27;m drinking a green smoothie daily</li>
            <li> I have been putting it on before bed almost every night and while it hasn&#x27;t had a negative effect</li>
            <li> Just a very small amount is all it takes for me to cover the area under and to the sides of my eyes.  </li>
            <li> It goes on in a thin coating and dries in place.</li>
            <li> It is just a weird feeling how sticky it is around your eye</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really expensive</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This was an okay product. I didn&#x27;t see a noticable difference in my skin, but didn&#x27;t find the product drying. I just didn&#x27;t see anything spectacular with it either.</li>
            <li> I am fairly pleased with the results. The serum feels good on my face and seems to have a bit of a tightening effect on my skin. However, I must offer the caveat that my wife cannot stand the smell, to the point where she refuses to use this after trying it once. The fragrance doesn&#x27;t bother me, although it is a little odd. It dissipates quickly, so it may not be a huge issue even for someone who doesn&#x27;t care for it, but at this price point, you might want to test it out in a store before you order it online scent unsmelled.</li>
            <li> What I love most about this eye serum is it&#x27;s scent. I&#x27;m not bashing the product, but I just LOVE the scent! However, that said, the best thing about an eye serum truly shouldn&#x27;t be how it smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way, so that&#x27;s good, but as far as it absorbing into my skin, I found that it didn&#x27;t very well. It stays moist and that&#x27;s bothersome to me. I haven&#x27;t seen any huge difference that this serum has made, but will continue to use it to see if there are better results after just 3 weeks of use, and will update here. This is also the reason for the 3 star rating, I feel I should give it a little more time to be fair.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Phyto 5 eye serum for a couple of weeks now and am happy with how the serum works.  I have used other eye serums in the past and the Phyto 5 is the only one that seems to have an all day moisturizing effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying the serum is simple.  It just takes a slight push on the top to get out just the small amount that a I need.  Just a very small amount is all it takes for me to cover the area under and to the sides of my eyes.  The serum has a very strong scent when first applied, but it dissipates within a few minutes.  I am very sensitive to scented products, but this serum works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my 30s and my trouble spots are dark circles under my eyes and under eye wrinkles when I smile.  This serum hasn&#x27;t helped with either so far.  What I like about the serum is the moisturizing effect.  It makes me feel like my eyes are being protected from the harsh dry air throughout the day.  It has a different feel to it than other under eye moisturizers I have used and lasts the entire day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am happy with the moisturizing effect of this serum, but am a little disappointed that it hasn&#x27;t done anything to remove the dark circles under my eyes or reduce the wrinkles under my eyes when I smile.</li>
            <li> My quest for something that actually helps with my puffy eyes continues, unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum, at least, is different from most eye-area moisturizer. It&#x27;s a kind of gel, very heavily scented of rosewater (which I happen to like, but be aware). It goes on in a thin coating and dries in place. In theory, it tightens, but apparently my skin doesn&#x27;t benefit from this feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I did notice that if I rubbed my eye area, like when putting on some concealer or something, the dried serum would come off in little pills and clumps. Not very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice to use, and not irritating, but just didn&#x27;t work for me. Maybe worth a try if you have loose skin and want the tightening feature. Just be aware that you&#x27;ll have to apply any subsequent makeup very gently.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical,so when I took a bit of the clear serum from the simple applicator container I used it under my eyes and above near the brow.I was very pleased with how my skin did not feel tight but visibly looked flatter and less puffy. I like the results and will continue using tho product. The funny part is that I really didn&#x27;t think I needed any toning-but lo and behold-I can use a bit.A little seems to go a long way.</li>
            <li> It does tighten the skin under your eye, but does nothing for puffiness, and costs a fortune, so use your common sense. It&#x27;s good, but not THAT good. You might want to look for a more cost effective solution.</li>
            <li> Comes in an easy to use bottle and smells of Rose essential oil. I have Rose essential oil that I paid a lot of money for and they smell exactly alike so I am impressed with the quality of this product. I have been using it for a month and haven&#x27;t noticed much difference, maybe it will show improvement in my eyes bags latter? The major problem I have with this product is it is sticky. I put it on in the mornings and my eyes have a stickiness that lasts for awhile. If I put makeup on like cover up or concealer this comes off in clumps. Like putting too much lotion on dirty skin and all your dead skin comes off and flakes heavy, that is what this does and it is gross. So you have to wash your face then put this on and then wait till it drys really well before applying makeup. I only put it on at night because I don&#x27;t have time to wait. It is just a weird feeling how sticky it is around your eye and it bugs.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I would like to give this a little more time to see &amp;#34;noticeable&amp;#34; improvements before I review so I might update my review again at a later date. I have very sensitive skin and most eye creams irritate my eyes. This does not. It goes on smoothly, without an odor and does not irritate or make my eyes water. I really like this and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> After about 5 days of use the firmness around my half-century old (plus) eyes is noticeable. It also doesn&#x27;t sting or have any fumes or vapors that bug my eyes, though there is a floral fragrance that fades pretty quickly on application. After using Phyto 5 Ageless Eye Serum I ask: are my eyes more &amp;#34;radiant, hydrated and youthful&amp;#34; as this product claims? Yes, they are &amp;#34;more&amp;#34; radiant, hydrated and youthful. Just nothing spectacular. Your own aesthetics will have to inform you whether or not this product is for you. But, it DOES work.</li>
            <li> This eye serum has helped a little. I can not say I am sold on it. But it was worth the try. It also is a little too thick. It takes a while to rub it all the way in.</li>
            <li> First I want to state that I have been using Phyto hair care products for years.  They are the best products for unruly or damaged hair.  With that said, I was excited to try the eye serum.  I have been using it for over 2 weeks now and I really cant see any significant difference on my eyes, or my bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using it to tighten up my bags after I applied my makeup like I do with my current cream that reduces puffiness and lines.  If I applied after my makeup, I saw no difference.  So I decided to put it on before my makeup and that didn&#x27;t work for me either because it was a little crusty and you could see it.  So, I stopped wearing it during the day and just applied it at night time. After 2 weeks, I did not notice a difference, however you may have to wear it longer to notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other reason for the 2 stars is the cost.  At 83.00 it is significantly more expensive than what I currently use and doesn&#x27;t work as well. It is also such a small amount that if you used it daily and then at night you would need another bottle in a month or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, it may just be me.  I really don&#x27;t like to leave a negative review on a product from a company that I love, but there you have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had the chance, I would try a sample and see how it works for you before you make the purchase.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because my wife&#x27;s eyes are only 45 years old and not 65, but this product had limited appeal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application is lovely: it has a nice texture and smells nice as well. It feels great going on and remains comfortable. Makeup can be applied over the top of it if you wish, or you can go out with just the serum. Once applied, it does have a nice tightening effect that lasts for a few hours, though it has not, as of yet, provided any long term positive results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, this may be a function of my wife&#x27;s eyes having only light lines so there&#x27;s not much to fix, but for her, while it was a very pleasant experience with a nice temporary effect, there did not seem to be any permanent line reduction over time. Perhaps, as another reviewer pointed out, was the skin looser and/or creased with more lines, there would have been a lasting change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, it&#x27;s a lovely experience but has not (yet) shown us the kind of performance that would prompt my wife to purchase more.</li>
            <li> I like this eye serum, but I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; it.  I have used an eye product for at least 10 years, and this is the first one that I have used that does not seem to absorb into the skin, no matter how long you gently pat or rub it in.  It lays on the surface, and dries to a slightly tacky shiny finish.  It does seem to tighten up the saggy skin and help with the old under eye bags, which I love.  But I feel that I must put on a foundation or powder makeup or SOMETHING over it, to mute that shine.  When I do this, I must be very very careful to barely touch the area, since the eye serum tends to roll off, the way dead skin rolls off.  I also am not wild about he scent, but that is minor.  And be very careful not to depress the dispenser pump all the way, since it will give you a dollop that would cover your entire face at least.  A tiny dab will do you.</li>
            <li> A real firming and tightening of the skin under the eyes could be felt, so I like this product.  Can&#x27;t speak to long term use yet, since I&#x27;ve only had the serum a few days now.  But I&#x27;ll edit this post if I see or feel anything else noteworthy.</li>
            <li> My wife has particularly sensitive skin, and has difficulty finding cosmetics and skin care products that don&#x27;t cause irritation or even rashes.  She was very pleased to find that this Eye Serum caused her no trouble, but was disappointed to find little in the way of noticeable results.  The scent was mild and not unpleasant, and the product absorbed quickly, but there was no apparent tightening (although in fairness, there is not much need for any).  So, while the formulation is good for sensitive skin, and the sensations are pleasant, the effects are minimal, at least for her very fair skin.</li>
            <li> You do not need but a little dab on your fingers for use on both eyes. I found it to be refreshing and soothing at the end of the day when I readied myself before bed. Goes on really smooth and immediately you can feel the cooling sense on tired eyes. I especially like the container it comes in and the easy dispensing top. Just one push and you have all you need. Better than a cucumber wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum twice daily under Algenist eye cream. The Algenist does a good job of taking care of small crows feet and mild puffiness, but I haven&#x27;t yet found anything to combat the dark circles (other than sleep). Even my favorite eye cream by La Mer doesn&#x27;t touch them, but I hoped a serum that claimed to help might do just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is fairly thick and rich for a serum (which I like), rather than watery like others I&#x27;ve tried. It has a light fragrance of roses, which dissipates fairly quickly. It absorbs a little slowly, but doesn&#x27;t leave the skin tacky or with any residue. I&#x27;m also happy this doesn&#x27;t cause any reaction in my sensitive skin. There might be a tiny bit more moisture in the skin on days when I use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I haven&#x27;t noticed that it really does anything noticeable. The skin under my eyes looks pretty much exactly the same as it does on the days I&#x27;ve forgotten to put this on, with the possible exception noted above (I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s in my head). There&#x27;s no tightening, no smoothing, and I definitely don&#x27;t notice any change in the dark circles. Maybe for others whose circles aren&#x27;t genetic (as I assume mine are) would have better luck. I&#x27;m definitely not left with skin that&#x27;s any more &amp;#34;radiant, hydrated and youthful,&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;more supple and luminous.&amp;#34; For the price, I&#x27;d expect a whole lot more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the benefits may take a while to show up, so I&#x27;ll update my review if anything changes. For now, I just can&#x27;t recommend this for the price.</li>
            <li> Older gal here. I have dry, older mom skin but not a huge amount of wrinkles around the eyes.  Just the micro ones thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also got sensitive skin not only because it&#x27;s dry but because I have a slew of allergies.  I had no bad reactions to this Serum.  No stinging or burning. The serum just went on without any irritation and then it tightened as it was supposed to do.  Well, mostly supposed to do.  I didn&#x27;t see a lot of change.  Maybe you need more wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also haven&#x27;t noticed any moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a final note I&#x27;ll say that when this dries it leaves a light shiny sheen.  If you are careful you can cover this with powder.</li>
            <li> This serum has something women love: results. It has a firming action that is noticeable for hours after application. Even after the first use. The serum is made partly from rose petals, and smells strongly of roses. It&#x27;s a natural scent, not artificial, but if you&#x27;re not a fan of roses, this might be an issue.</li>
            <li> This eye serum has a faint pleasant scent.  Although there were no directions on the bottle or box, I found directions on how and when to apply in the product description here.  I applied it after washing my face in the morning and used circular motions around my eye on both lids and the corners where I have crows feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It left a little sticky residue for a few minutes but then that absorbed.  I would advise waiting a few minutes to apply eye makeup after using this product.  The skin around my eyes instantly felt tighter and after a few minutes, I was pleasantly surprised to see my regular dark circles under my eyes were almost gone.  It reduced the puffiness of my eyes and some small wrinkles under my eye were minimized.  I did not see a huge difference in my crows feet however.  They may have been minimally improved but were still very visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product but am hesitant to give it five stars because of the high price and the fact that it won&#x27;t really improve deep crows feet.  However, it is wonderful for getting rid of puffiness, dark circles, and minor lines.</li>
            <li> My wife says the serum is light weight and the effects are felt immediately. Absorption into the skin and the tightening effect is incredible. She applies it twice a day and it has amazing effect.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see any difference in my skin when I wash it off but it does hide the lines a little. It has a rose scent which I don&#x27;t really care for but it isn&#x27;t overpowering. It is thick and the pump will pump too much out with one full pump so a half pump is about right. It is probably too soon to tell about any anti aging effects. It does make the skin around my eyes feel tightened so it does have a very limited effect on the skin as far as I can tell. It does stay sticky feeling for a while which I don&#x27;t like. My eyes are a little saggy so it does make this appear a little better and it does hide the lines a little under my eyes. I don&#x27;t have crows feet but I do have lines under my eyes that bother me and make me look old and tired. It looks kind of shiny unless you put makeup on top of it so I would recommend some makeup with it</li>
            <li> The Phyto 5 Ageless Eye Serum is pleasant to use, and it smooths and tightens the under-eye area. The herbal-rose scent lessens with time after the application. The compact pump dispenser is quick and easy, but use the pump with a light touch to avoid dispensing too much product. The serum itself is light and applies well to the skin, but when it dries, it leaves a film on the surface of the skin rather than being absorbed. It seems as though the film tightens as it dries, thereby giving the \\&quot;lift\\&quot; to the under-eye area. When you cleanse your face after using the product, you feel the serum coming back off of the skin. As a temporary firming product for the under-eye area, it works well.</li>
            <li> Ah, anti-aging products. In general, I tend to review them like this: does it feel good? does it smell good? does it contain ingredients I&#x27;m comfortable with having on my face?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ask these questions because the answer to the *real* question (&amp;#34;Does it make you look younger?&amp;#34;) is pretty much always no. You know what makes you look younger? A TIME MACHINE. Is this eye serum a time machine? NO IT IS NOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, does it feel good? Yes it does. It&#x27;s a thick translucent gel, and it spreads on very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it smell good? I think so! It&#x27;s got a gentle rose fragrance that I very much enjoyed, although a neighbor who tried this out described it as &amp;#34;too perfumey&amp;#34; for them, so your mileage may vary. I&#x27;m sensitive to heavy cloying floral fragrances, and this is definitely not that. I liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it contain ingredients I&#x27;m ok with having on my face? Well, I appreciate the commitment to plant-based ingredients (95% is pretty good!), but I&#x27;m a bit concerned that it contains Sodium Hydroxide (lye). That said, I had no negative reactions to the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to say that this is a nice splurgey product, but it&#x27;s not really a value given the lack of results I saw after a month or using it. Then again, it&#x27;s not a time machine... so my expectations were low. Did it feel good? Yeah. Smell good? Yeah. Not contain too much toxic grossness. Yeeeah-ish.</li>
            <li> I have fairly bad puffiness below my eyes and although I&#x27;m drinking a green smoothie daily and I eat very healthy, the puffiness remains, although some days it is worse than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first the serum doesn&#x27;t seem to work but then hours later I look at my face and my under-the-eye puffiness is gone and I look better so really hard to say if it works on the puffiness because it is not immediate but the lines around my eyes are not noticeable.  I&#x27;m 59 by the way and have been using the serum daily for a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eye cream has some perfume aroma but it is not overwhelming, and I like the scent.&lt;br /&gt;The serum dries tacky, and seems to stay that way.  I cover it with face powder to eliminate the stickiness.  It&#x27;s really expensive but a little goes a long way so it will last a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 48, just to put that out there, up front.  I think my eye area looks my age, and to some degree I&#x27;m okay with that.  I&#x27;ve laughed a lot, I&#x27;ve cried a lot, and that is going to take its toll in lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m not interested in my eyes looking younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I tried this, without real high expectations.  First off, many products like this bother my skin, kind of a stinging sensation.  This one doesn&#x27;t at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t feel like I had some huge, &amp;#34;WOW!  LOOK AT THAT!&amp;#34; moment with this product, but I have noticed two things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) a few minutes after applying it, the skin around my eyes does feel like it has tightened up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) after using this for about two weeks (and I&#x27;m not faithful about using it morning and evening, as instructed, but I&#x27;m usually using it at least in the morning) the laugh lines are less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;m liking the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure I will ever be able to rationalize the price, though, as this is spendy stuff.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of daily use under the eyes I can report that the serum has produced a tightening and soothing effect of that thinner, fragile skin. In view of the included ingredients that was not unexpected. Rose Oil and Rose Water are included in many products including perfume as well as tonics taken orally. As you might guess, rose oil is produced from rose pedals, requiring a large quantity of flowers for a small quantity of oil, making pure oil very expensive to produce. It is rich in vitamins, is a natural anti-inflammatory and is said to promote healing. Another featured ingredient, Beech Tree Bud Extract, contains hydroxyproline, which is claimed to encourage production of collagen, the lattice that keeps skin taunt and so reduce the appearance of fine lines. Three weeks is a bare minimum to report on any noticeable difference in skin composition, and I can only thus far say the serum is refreshing, does help reduce puffiness and has a tightening feel. There is some question as to hydroxyproline&#x27;s ability to penetrate the skin deeply enough to effect a change and some report greater benefits might be derived from making sure the amino acid it&#x27;s derived from is sufficiently present in your diet, though deficiencies are rare and it&#x27;s important to consume amino acids in their proper ratios so oral  supplementation is not encouraged.  Though I found the product soothing I gave it only 3 stars because the effect was at most subtle considering the premium cost.  Each person&#x27;s skin and chemistry are different so you might want to experiment to see your individual results. I&#x27;ll also need to report back later after a more extended use to give it a fair evaluation due to the incremental and gradual change of any skin nutritional product that only occurs over time.</li>
            <li> So since I received this item through the Vine I had 30 days to test it before I had to write a review.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve given it almost the full 30 days and here&#x27;s what I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m having a hard time telling if there has been any change at all. I have been putting it on before bed almost every night and while it hasn&#x27;t had a negative effect I really cant say it&#x27;s done much to make my skin look any more youthful either.&lt;br /&gt;I am 40 years old and do a lot of laughing so I&#x27;m starting to get some laugh lines but not too bad.&lt;br /&gt;The product goes on clear and leaves a slight film but it&#x27;s not too bad.&lt;br /&gt;Has a familiar smell that I cant place, honestly I don&#x27;t find it pleasant but maybe that&#x27;s just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any irritation at all from it on my skin so that&#x27;s a good thing. However it does seem to irritate my eyes a little which is why I started only applying it when i was going to sleep at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish i could say its a miracle worker. Maybe it is for some but I don&#x27;t seem to be getting very noticeable results.&lt;br /&gt;I will take a before picture and continue using it until the bottle is empty, if there is anything worth posting I&#x27;ll post an after shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now it feels like more of a preventative measure than a restorative one.</li>
