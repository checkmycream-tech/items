            <li>Great product!!!!</li>
            <li>This eyebrow makeup is the best been using this product for about 8 years</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I use the brown powder and stencils to define my brows and cover the gray (works great esp if you dab a moist finger over the gray hairs before you stencil).</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>So happy with everything.</li>
            <li>After reading the good reviews about this product, I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>Love the product and was happy to find it since mine was out</li>
            <li>I thought this product would be a good way for me to get a nice, even brow.  </li>
            <li>Great eyebrow kit, makes doing eyebrow as easy as could be.</li>
            <li>The best brow product I have ever used and very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>but this product is quite nice, I discovered it at a mall threading shop.  </li>
            <li>Great price, fast shipping!</li>
            <li>The stencils are ok, they&#x27;re better than a lot that are out there.</li>
            <li>I love this eyebrow shadow.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this.</li>
            <li>I love this eyebrow makeup.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love that it stays on even when you sweat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to buy two more when one would have lasted me years.</li>
            <li>It was fair, during hot weather, and my face being oily, it was a product that didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>I recently bought the Christian Perfect Brow in Australia for my mother and it came in a beautiful case with a lovely two-sided brush and the eyebrow stencils.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t even imagine how excited I was to find it being sold at my favorite online connection, Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply, not permanent but</li>
            <li>I have light brown hair and the dark brown color is perfect.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for everyday and during occasions.</li>
            <li>but it was still to light for me</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it since I am losing most of my brow to old age and greying hairs!</li>
            <li>If your natural eyebrows are more rounded like mine the stencil just won&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own with no stencil and a different brush but truthfully, I have some Maybelline eyebrow powder color that was half the price and does just as good a job.  </li>
            <li>It easy and very functional, you can choice diferent sizes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d probably like this product if I had a different stencil that more accurately fit my eyebrow.  </li>
            <li>Admittedly, it was $40 there, but worth the money.  </li>
            <li>First, the brush that comes with the kit can only be used with the stencil so if the stencil isn&#x27;t the shape you want  you won&#x27;t be able to use the huge brush that comes with it</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get this, because I have very sparse eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Maybe if I got black I would have been more satisfied.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a great eyebrow shadow to fill in the small gaps.</li>
            <li>Even stays on in hot weather.</li>
            <li>I tried to use the stencil, more than once, just on the ends of my eyebrows with limited success.  </li>
            <li>I certainly wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s semi permanent</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Very with the purchase.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>The dark brown is perfect, the stencils(could be bigger) are great, but the only thing that was a bummer was when I tried yanking a small hair off the little brush that comes with it</li>
            <li>But I bought dark brown from a different vender and it matched perfectly and was less powdery as this one.</li>
            <li>Nicer, more expensive compacts are pressed better.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Love the product, I use it everyday.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long lasting and it has all shades and way better than have</li>
            <li>This must not be the same company or a very cheap imitation.  </li>
            <li>My face looks fresh and it&#x27;s not a stark contrast against my long gray hair.</li>
            <li>Also, while other reviewers said the product stayed on all day I have to mention that the first time I used it I accidentally brushed up against my eyebrow right after applying it and completely erased that eyebrow.    </li>
            <li>Stays on.all day and looks natural.</li>
            <li>But my superglue fixed it.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>It is extremely light on my dark skin, it&#x27;s actually lighter than my actual eyebrow color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no where near dark brown, it&#x27;s more of a greenish brown colour, I&#x27;m not sure what hair colour you would have to have for it to match.</li>
            <li>I get endless compliments on the shape of my eyebrows thanks to Christian Eyebrow Makeup Kit.  </li>

            <li> I get endless compliments on the shape of my eyebrows thanks to Christian Eyebrow Makeup Kit.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin as I do and are not able to have your eyebrows waxed, then take the time to do them yourself and come out looking as if you just had your eyebrows professionally done.</li>
            <li> only complaint is because of they changed the brush, and the new one it´s softer, so the finished is not equal than before.</li>
            <li> The powder is not pigmented enough or dark enough for me to use</li>
            <li> stays as long as I need it to.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, it was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> The stencil is a bit flimsy so you have to be careful not to tear it.  </li>
            <li> If you have few eyebrows this is definitely for you, I&#x27;ve used this product over 10 yrs</li>
            <li> The eyebrow stencils are all quite thin, even the one marked thick and all are very angular.  </li>
            <li> I got the dark brown  </li>
            <li> I wish there were other colors!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 51 year old woman whose eyebrows have been getting a little thin at the ends.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to buy it again because I lost the little molds that came with the kit that helps you shape your brows.  </li>
            <li> I usually think you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> so I usually just use the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; stencil or sometimes the &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; stencil.</li>
            <li> It has been a big disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had thick brows and have kept them in order with threading and waxing.</li>
            <li> So I would not recommend this, not good quality.</li>
            <li> not perfect</li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t drop the shadow case because it WILL crumble, and then be useless.  </li>
            <li> For now, it&#x27;s a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I cannot even use the brush, it&#x27;s so pathetic, and there&#x27;s no case in which to hold everything.  </li>

            <li> I was really excited to get this, because I have very sparse eyebrows. Honestly, it was very disappointing. It&#x27;s no where near dark brown, it&#x27;s more of a greenish brown colour, I&#x27;m not sure what hair colour you would have to have for it to match. The stencils are ok, they&#x27;re better than a lot that are out there.</li>
            <li> After reading the good reviews about this product, I decided to try it. It is extremely light on my dark skin, it&#x27;s actually lighter than my actual eyebrow color. Maybe if I got black I would have been more satisfied. But I bought dark brown from a different vender and it matched perfectly and was less powdery as this one. So I would not recommend this, not good quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. I&#x27;ve always had thick brows and have kept them in order with threading and waxing. However, with the years have come some gray brow hairs and I didn&#x27;t want to pluck my eyebrows into oblivion! I use the brown powder and stencils to define my brows and cover the gray (works great esp if you dab a moist finger over the gray hairs before you stencil). My face looks fresh and it&#x27;s not a stark contrast against my long gray hair. Great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 51 year old woman whose eyebrows have been getting a little thin at the ends. I thought this product would be a good way for me to get a nice, even brow.  Based on the reviews I purchased it.  It has been a big disappointment.  First, the brush that comes with the kit can only be used with the stencil so if the stencil isn&#x27;t the shape you want  you won&#x27;t be able to use the huge brush that comes with it you&#x27;ll have to acquire a different brush.  The eyebrow stencils are all quite thin, even the one marked thick and all are very angular.  If your natural eyebrows are more rounded like mine the stencil just won&#x27;t fit.  Also, while other reviewers said the product stayed on all day I have to mention that the first time I used it I accidentally brushed up against my eyebrow right after applying it and completely erased that eyebrow.    I tried to use the stencil, more than once, just on the ends of my eyebrows with limited success.  I tried using the eyebrow color on it&#x27;s own with no stencil and a different brush but truthfully, I have some Maybelline eyebrow powder color that was half the price and does just as good a job.  I&#x27;d probably like this product if I had a different stencil that more accurately fit my eyebrow.  For now, it&#x27;s a disappointment.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.  I have gone back to my eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li> The best brow product I have ever used and very inexpensive. Stays on.all day and looks natural. Even stays on in hot weather.</li>
            <li> Love the product and was happy to find it since mine was out and I couldn&#x27;t find it at my location.</li>
            <li> It was fair, during hot weather, and my face being oily, it was a product that didn&#x27;t work for me. Cooler temperatures this is do well.</li>
            <li> What a great deal! I love this eyebrow shadow. I really don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s semi permanent but it&#x27;s a great eyebrow shadow to fill in the small gaps. I highly recommend it. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this. No joke. The dark brown is perfect, the stencils(could be bigger) are great, but the only thing that was a bummer was when I tried yanking a small hair off the little brush that comes with it and it all came out. But my superglue fixed it. So happy with everything. c:</li>
            <li> Love the product, I use it everyday. The only suggestion for improvement is the brush, sometime do not work well not enev.</li>
            <li> I recently bought the Christian Perfect Brow in Australia for my mother and it came in a beautiful case with a lovely two-sided brush and the eyebrow stencils.  Admittedly, it was $40 there, but worth the money.  This must not be the same company or a very cheap imitation.  I cannot even use the brush, it&#x27;s so pathetic, and there&#x27;s no case in which to hold everything.  I certainly wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again.  Think I will return.</li>
            <li> It easy and very functional, you can choice diferent sizes. It makes you look gorgeous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is because of they changed the brush, and the new one it´s softer, so the finished is not equal than before.</li>
            <li> excellent product charm me 100% recommended.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product some time ago and I wanted to buy it again because I lost the little molds that came with the kit that helps you shape your brows.  To my dismay, the store I bought it from went out of business.  You can&#x27;t even imagine how excited I was to find it being sold at my favorite online connection, Amazon.  I get endless compliments on the shape of my eyebrows thanks to Christian Eyebrow Makeup Kit.  If you have sensitive skin as I do and are not able to have your eyebrows waxed, then take the time to do them yourself and come out looking as if you just had your eyebrows professionally done.</li>
            <li> I wish there were other colors! Great product!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this eyebrow makeup.  I have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this product.  Only product she uses</li>
            <li> I am still trying to master it, but I can goods results coming.</li>
            <li> Great eyebrow kit, makes doing eyebrow as easy as could be. Save tons of time every morning, shape always comes out the way I want it to.</li>
            <li> This eyebrow makeup is the best been using this product for about 8 years and I love it. Love that it stays on even when you sweat.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I expected.  Meets my needs.  Brow shapes are usable...not perfect but what is?  We are all different.  Easy to apply, not permanent but stays as long as I need it to.  Glad I bought it since I am losing most of my brow to old age and greying hairs!</li>
            <li> I usually think you get what you pay for but this product is quite nice, I discovered it at a mall threading shop.  I have light brown hair and the dark brown color is perfect.  The stencil is a bit flimsy so you have to be careful not to tear it.  And don&#x27;t drop the shadow case because it WILL crumble, and then be useless.  Nicer, more expensive compacts are pressed better.  I&#x27;ve had to buy two more when one would have lasted me years.</li>
            <li> Perfect for everyday and during occasions.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the stencil. The powder is not pigmented enough or dark enough for me to use so I usually just use the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; stencil or sometimes the &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; stencil.</li>
            <li> Very with the purchase.  My 3rd.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Great price, fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast. I got the dark brown  but it was still to light for me</li>
            <li> If you have few eyebrows this is definitely for you, I&#x27;ve used this product over 10 yrs and I LOVE it!!!!!! It&#x27;s long lasting and it has all shades and way better than have your eyebrows tattooed.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this product!!!!!</li>
