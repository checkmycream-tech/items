            <li>Cleans and smells good.</li>
            <li>The matching deodorant is also very nice and effective.  </li>
            <li>Axe shower gel works great and smells great without being overly strong.</li>
            <li>Smells great but bottle has an angled top</li>
            <li>This is our favorite scent and at $15 for 6 bottles it was a steal... cant seem to find that good of a price now though.</li>

            <li>I think this is by far the best smelling axe shower gel.</li>
            <li>VERY FAST DELIVERY AND GREAT PRICE</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this axe shower gel, this is the only thing I buy and with the deal on amazon, its perfect</li>
            <li>Need I say more?</li>
            <li>Which still cost a $1 more.</li>
            <li>Both my boyfriend and I love this scent.  </li>
            <li>It works well and the scent of it has to be my favorite.</li>
            <li>and I realized that was the consistency I have been used to and was a much better experience.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought in bulk.</li>
            <li>I have bought this stuff for years, and I still love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and I repeatedly order it.</li>
            <li>Do not apply body spray on top.</li>
            <li>The price for a 6-pack is pretty good too.</li>
            <li>She likes the familiar smell at this point :)</li>
            <li>Not too strong as to interfere with any cologne.</li>
            <li>It has a nice, balanced scent that is very much in line with Armani Attitude</li>
            <li>Just a bit more scent than usual but probably the best fragrance offered by Axe.  </li>
            <li>Love it, not only does it clean well but smells great, would never go elsewhere.</li>
            <li>The scent is more of a sweet/spicy nature than a fresh, citrus nature - but it really is masculine and pleasant.</li>
            <li>Nice long lasting and strong scent, not too strong to annoy but perfect to charm.</li>
            <li>As said in other reviews here on the Amazon channel, Axe products are the best for shower gels, IMHO, but choose your own from a broad line of smells.</li>
            <li>Dark Temptation smells awesome and keeps you fresh all day.</li>
            <li>(if you are familiar with that cologne).</li>
            <li>Fortunately am able to lean it against the wall of the shower and it stays pretty well.</li>
            <li>I just use it for the clean feeling it gives me.</li>
            <li>Smells good and last a while.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good body wash that gets you clean and lathers pretty well without making your skin dry.  </li>
            <li>Goth girlfriend loves it, smells like chocolate, dark themed, I always get this kind!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the scent for everyone which is why I gave it four stars, other than that, its a good buy</li>
            <li>I got a quick whiff at the store and really didn&#x27;t like the coconut scent.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not sure whether that&#x27;s a good thing or not.  </li>
            <li>It was, almost immediately, given \\&quot;LARGE</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have any complaints.  </li>
            <li>The people at Axe must have thought they had a real winner on their hands when they came out with this scent.</li>
            <li>However, I really do like it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product overall, but the commercials for this line of gels are a bit over the top and exaggerated.</li>
            <li>The only impact was that the shower gel got used quickly, ohh well...</li>
            <li>Personally I think the old spice line of scents smell better overall</li>
            <li>This is a normal every day use product for me.  </li>
            <li>I got a bottle of Dark Temptation shower gel for free recently, and must say that it leaves you smelling fresh, and feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li>Will keep buying them since I love the smell and also it doesnt dry my skin out too much like some of the other shower gels I have used.</li>
            <li>He really likes this scent, and my local stores don&#x27;t carry the stick deodorant in this scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only soap I&#x27;ve found to date that does not dry my skin out too much.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is invigorating, especially for an early morning shower.</li>
            <li>This is a good buy at this price for the bulk, because even if the guys you know don&#x27;t use it all of the time, they usually opt for this over some peaches and cream crap you have by Dove or Oil of Olay.&lt;br /&gt;Besides, whats a better way to say you care than to give the ones you care about a bottle of soap?</li>
            <li>I love Axe shower gel, but I like only a few scents such as Dark Temptation.</li>

            <li> I love Axe shower gel, but I like only a few scents such as Dark Temptation.</li>
            <li> The price, the expedient response, enhaces the shower experience while completing the necessary cleaning without a dry or greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I thought this consistency of the gel is specific to the \\&quot;Dark Temptation\\&quot; brand and gave it no further thought (until recently).</li>
            <li> The other stuff (attraction) is for the younger generation to sort out.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recently I bought the Axe Shower Gel, Dark Temptation, single pack off the shelf at a local store</li>
            <li> This stuff gets you clean no matter how dirty you are.</li>
            <li> axe shower gel, dark temptation, the product speaks for itself.  </li>
            <li> , I felt the Shower gel was dilute (sort of watered down) compared to previous Axe shower gels I have used.</li>
            <li> Chocolaty with a little kick of spice and fruit.</li>
            <li> I could not find a less expensive price anywhere else.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s awkward to place upside down as the contents are depleted.</li>
            <li> He has been using this for a couple of years and it works, never get tired of smelling it.  </li>
            <li> I hate the soap on a rope, it&#x27;s so cliche.</li>
            <li> Packaging was terrible, shrink wrap with no support.  </li>

            <li> Love the smell of this axe shower gel, this is the only thing I buy and with the deal on amazon, its perfect, I always buy them in bulk and have been happy with the product as well as the price. I think this is by far the best smelling axe shower gel. I also have the deodorant sticks in the same fragrance. Will keep buying them since I love the smell and also it doesnt dry my skin out too much like some of the other shower gels I have used.</li>
            <li> My wife loves chocolate.  She eats the stuff up like an addict.  This stuff smells like chocolate.  Need I say more?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always make it for Christmas or Birthdays, and you never know when someone may need an extra bar of soap and all you have on hand is what makes you smell girly. This is a good buy at this price for the bulk, because even if the guys you know don&#x27;t use it all of the time, they usually opt for this over some peaches and cream crap you have by Dove or Oil of Olay.&lt;br /&gt;Besides, whats a better way to say you care than to give the ones you care about a bottle of soap? I hate the soap on a rope, it&#x27;s so cliche. It&#x27;s not the scent for everyone which is why I gave it four stars, other than that, its a good buy and I would definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great. My husband says it leaves you feeling great all day!! Amazon is the cheapest place I found it, another then SAMs. Which still cost a $1 more.</li>
            <li> GOOD BUY&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE THIS PRODUCT ON STANDING ORDER AND NEVER LOOKED BACK.&lt;br /&gt;My husband loves this product and won&#x27;t stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it came with different scents though....its just one but we&#x27;ll make it work</li>
            <li> I love Axe shower gel, but I like only a few scents such as Dark Temptation. Dark Temptation smells awesome and keeps you fresh all day.</li>
            <li> Just got my order and started using this.  I don&#x27;t really have any complaints.  It&#x27;s a good body wash that gets you clean and lathers pretty well without making your skin dry.  I just can&#x27;t get over the fact that it smells like tootsie rolls to me and I&#x27;m not sure whether that&#x27;s a good thing or not.  I ordered the six pack from Amazon so we&#x27;ll see if I get hooked after going through these.  Personally I think the old spice line of scents smell better overall but I do like some of the axe antiperspirant scents I&#x27;ve used before switching to just deodorant (sans antiperspirant).</li>
            <li> Excellent service. Product just as described.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal on a nice product. I use it quite often and everyone around always says I smell great. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. Can&#x27;t beat this deal</li>
            <li> This stuff gets you clean no matter how dirty you are. Lathers up good and leaves you smelling like a man. Good stuff</li>
            <li> The people at Axe must have thought they had a real winner on their hands when they came out with this scent. It was, almost immediately, given \\&quot;LARGE BOTTLE\\&quot; status. I got a quick whiff at the store and really didn&#x27;t like the coconut scent. When I was showering with it, I felt like I was bathing with suntan lotion. I don&#x27;t know of any women who get off on the smell of coconuts. Are coconuts and suntan lotion even considered \\&quot;manly\\&quot; scents? I think not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re trying to get the ladies by smelling \\&quot;hot,\\&quot; this one&#x27;s a big \\&quot;not\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> axe shower gel, dark temptation, the product speaks for itself.  The price, the expedient response, enhaces the shower experience while completing the necessary cleaning without a dry or greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Both my boyfriend and I love this scent.  I have a standing every month order for 6 bottles to help him not run out.</li>
            <li> This is our favorite scent and at $15 for 6 bottles it was a steal... cant seem to find that good of a price now though.</li>
            <li> Nice long lasting and strong scent, not too strong to annoy but perfect to charm.</li>
            <li> He has been using this for a couple of years and it works, never get tired of smelling it.  The shipping and the price is good.</li>
            <li> Packaging was terrible, shrink wrap with no support.  3 of 6 bottles had leaked to the extent USPS had re-wrapped it in a garbage bag.  Even then fluid was pooled in package.  5 of the 6 was item ordered, 6th was different brand.</li>
            <li> Obviously, each individual is going to have preferences for scents - but I have to say , out of all the AXE offerings, I find this one to be the best (and I have tried them all). It has a nice, balanced scent that is very much in line with Armani Attitude (if you are familiar with that cologne). The scent is more of a sweet/spicy nature than a fresh, citrus nature - but it really is masculine and pleasant. A good winter/night out scent.</li>
            <li> I like it and my wife likes it.  It doesn&#x27;t clash with the cologne that my wife likes me to wear, also (Drakkar Noir).</li>
            <li> I like the way my husband smells. That is a good thing. He really likes this scent, and my local stores don&#x27;t carry the stick deodorant in this scent. I subscribe and save for the deodorant/antiperspirant and the shower gel, so he never runs out. I&#x27;m going to have to up my order, though, because two of my sons have decided they want this stuff too.</li>
            <li> I could not find a less expensive price anywhere else.  Smells really good. :)</li>
            <li> My 2 kids and husband all use this and smell good after taking a shower, now if I can just get the teens to use the body spray and deoorant too!!</li>
            <li> This is a normal every day use product for me.  It works well and the scent of it has to be my favorite.</li>
            <li> This a nice shower gel and has a great scent. The price for a 6-pack is pretty good too. I have been using different Axe shower gels for a while now and they&#x27;ve all been good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got this order, I felt the Shower gel was dilute (sort of watered down) compared to previous Axe shower gels I have used. I thought this consistency of the gel is specific to the \\&quot;Dark Temptation\\&quot; brand and gave it no further thought (until recently). The only impact was that the shower gel got used quickly, ohh well...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I bought the Axe Shower Gel, Dark Temptation, single pack off the shelf at a local store and I realized that was the consistency I have been used to and was a much better experience. This bulk pack I got from Amazon was diluted. Perhaps, you get what you pay for, but I did not expect that from Amazon bulk packs.</li>
            <li> Axe shower gel works great and smells great without being overly strong. Axe products are great.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would like it. However, I really do like it.  Smells good and last a while. Glad I bought in bulk.</li>
            <li> VERY FAST DELIVERY AND GREAT PRICE</li>
            <li> I have bought this stuff for years, and I still love it.  It&#x27;s the only soap I&#x27;ve found to date that does not dry my skin out too much.</li>
            <li> Cleans and smells good. Not too strong as to interfere with any cologne. Will buy again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Have used Axe Body Wash for years. Love it, not only does it clean well but smells great, would never go elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Goth girlfriend loves it, smells like chocolate, dark themed, I always get this kind!  She likes the familiar smell at this point :)</li>
            <li> I love this product and I repeatedly order it.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is invigorating, especially for an early morning shower. The matching deodorant is also very nice and effective.  Also I would recommend their shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> great product...she loves it.</li>
            <li> This and the underarm complement are the best products AXE has made in years. Chocolaty with a little kick of spice and fruit. Mixed with sweat, it actually still smells decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, AXE with moderation. Do not apply body spray on top.</li>
            <li> What can you say, it&#x27;s shower gel! Smells great but bottle has an angled top so it&#x27;s awkward to place upside down as the contents are depleted. Fortunately am able to lean it against the wall of the shower and it stays pretty well.</li>
