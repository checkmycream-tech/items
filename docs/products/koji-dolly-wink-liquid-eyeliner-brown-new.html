            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>

            <li>This eyeliner is pretty good.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I will ever find a eye liner as perfect as this one, and I&#x27;ve tried Mac, Bobbi Brown, Lancome, along with drugstore brands, and every single type of liquid, gel, pencil, push pencil, etc.--you name it</li>
            <li>Might have been better if the shade was darker or a bit more bold brown</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t budge.</li>
            <li>This liner goes on so easily and never budges.  </li>

            <li>Light eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>It is super easy to control.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a beginner like me to liquid liner or have small eyes like me, this pen is perfect.</li>
            <li>Super fine lets you control thickness</li>
            <li>The product formula appears to be the same, which is good.  </li>
            <li>It looked so bold and did not smudge at all.  </li>
            <li>easy to use, quick dry, thin, good color and perfect quality.</li>
            <li>The precision is nice, but it&#x27;s not very dark or smudge-proof.  </li>
            <li>I only wish they made it in more colors!</li>
            <li>The brown gives my eyes a more natural look.</li>
            <li>Nice color and easy to draw thin lines</li>
            <li>This is great for drawing a thin line on your eyelid.</li>
            <li>I never use it and it would be too much of a hassle to try to return it.  </li>
            <li>It goes on very nice and as thin as imaginable.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li>The pencil alone without it would have looked exactly the same.</li>
            <li>Frequent application is required.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and sometimes react to cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s super dark ink.</li>

            <li> And it&#x27;s super dark ink.</li>
            <li> Everything has either smudged, flaked, been irritating, or come clean off so it would need to be reapplied several times, but Dolly Wink is the only one that has surpassed all these challenges!</li>
            <li> The only thing I will cross my fingers over is that Dolly Wink will last me a long while, I&#x27;ve only been using it for the past 3 weeks so far</li>
            <li> But it didn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> This barely goes on my medium complexion so it is a waste.  </li>
            <li> I think im going to try the black next time.</li>
            <li> (black is too dark &amp; noticeable).  </li>
            <li> I have it in brown and black.  </li>
            <li> I have the black and just got the broen for lighter days.</li>
            <li> and the tip is stiff enough that with a shaky beginners hand, it doesn&#x27;t go all over the place.</li>
            <li> so I just decided to buy it for everyday use</li>
            <li> Hard to explain.</li>
            <li> This product was awful!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Luv, Luv, Luv &amp; let me not 4get I LUV THIS EYELINER :)  I will mos def buy again</li>
            <li> Just received it today and i had to try it. The shipping was just on time. The brown gives my eyes a more natural look. I think im going to try the black next time.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t budge. I love it.</li>
            <li> Light eyeliner.  The precision is nice, but it&#x27;s not very dark or smudge-proof.  Frequent application is required.</li>
            <li> Definitely my HG liner now. I was looking for a cheaper version of Stila Stay all Day and the KVD liner and this is it. I will definitely keep buying these.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I was expecting based on the reviews.  They are not eas to use. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them.</li>
            <li> Ever since I heard about Dolly Wink on a blog and tried it, I&#x27;ve never looked back. This liner goes on so easily and never budges.  It is a nice, think line and I love it.  I have it in brown and black.  I only wish they made it in more colors!</li>
            <li> This is great for drawing a thin line on your eyelid. It&#x27;s also very easy to use.  I love that it is a brush instead of a felt tip.</li>
            <li> Excellent! So easy to use, and it stays on all day.</li>
            <li> fades on oily eye lids</li>
            <li> Nice color and easy to draw thin lines but doesn&#x27;t last all day like Stila&#x27;s stay all day which is a similar price. Will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite liquid liner. If you&#x27;re a beginner like me to liquid liner or have small eyes like me, this pen is perfect. Super fine lets you control thickness and the tip is stiff enough that with a shaky beginners hand, it doesn&#x27;t go all over the place. Hard to explain. Must try. And it&#x27;s super dark ink. I have the black and just got the broen for lighter days.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will ever find a eye liner as perfect as this one, and I&#x27;ve tried Mac, Bobbi Brown, Lancome, along with drugstore brands, and every single type of liquid, gel, pencil, push pencil, etc.--you name it and I&#x27;ve tried it! Everything has either smudged, flaked, been irritating, or come clean off so it would need to be reapplied several times, but Dolly Wink is the only one that has surpassed all these challenges! The only thing I will cross my fingers over is that Dolly Wink will last me a long while, I&#x27;ve only been using it for the past 3 weeks so far but I hope it doesn&#x27;t run out soon. Even if it did, I would rather spend my money getting another Dolly Wink than on high-end brands with their &amp;#34;sacred pools&amp;#34; of eyeliner ink (considering their price)!</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is pretty good. It doesnt smudge and the color is a nice brown. Might have been better if the shade was darker or a bit more bold brown</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. I love the stylus. It is super easy to control. I can get a line of any width quickly &amp; easily. I put it on in the morning and it&#x27;s on until I choose to remove it. I have not had any problem with running, flaking or smudging. This is my all time favorite eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product.  I currently use a brown pencil from Stila but wanted to try an inexpensive liquid version.  I&#x27;ve tried the black liner and it went on so flawlessly on my hand when I tried it in the store.  It looked so bold and did not smudge at all.  I should have tried the brown as well but did not.  My friend has both colors and said she liked the brown better so I just decided to buy it for everyday use (black is too dark &amp; noticeable).  This barely goes on my medium complexion so it is a waste.  I never use it and it would be too much of a hassle to try to return it.  It sits in my make up bag and on the singular occasion I did use it, I had to supplement it with my brown liner pencil.  The pencil alone without it would have looked exactly the same.</li>
            <li> This product was awful!</li>
            <li> The product formula appears to be the same, which is good.  I have sensitive skin and sometimes react to cosmetics.  I have not had any issues with any of the Koji products.  The quality is good. The liner is a great color (as described) and it goes on great and stays on.</li>
            <li> It goes on very nice and as thin as imaginable.  But it didn&#x27;t last very long.  Maybelline and Covergirl products have double the liquid.</li>
            <li> easy to use, quick dry, thin, good color and perfect quality. Very good eyeliner, maybe I will buy anther one. Five star!</li>
