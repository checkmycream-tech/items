            <li> I love this product it did miracles for my hair!</li>
            <li> Love this product it leaves my hair soft and smelling great. Controls the frizz</li>
            <li> This is fantastic. I use it on my hair from the neck down right after washing. It is very light; not a heavy oil. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily either as long as I avoid the scalp and I can brush my long wet hair wth no tangles. It smells really good too; just a light natural fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my dogs too--I have 2 long haired shin tzus and it gets rid of tangles and moisturizers their coat. They used to have skin problems and one had dandruff but this has taken care of both!</li>
            <li> I highlight my hair every 6 weeks and I use this product everyday. Makes my hair feel soft and healthy! !</li>
            <li> Great Service!!! The product is light and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> Favorite hair oil. Great for off-days and after you wash your hair to put it in while your hair&#x27;s still wet, right before it dries. It keeps it well-moistured without being weighed down like a leave-in conditioner can do sometimes. HIGHLY recommend, especially if you&#x27;re growing your hair out or concerned about keeping healthy length!</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing product I have ever used on my hair. My hairstylist recommended it a few months ago because my hair tends to be very dry. I was sceptical and paid more than I should have there for it but the results were worth every penny. I have searched everywhere for the same product in the shampoo and conditioner. I did find it here however it does not contain the Argan Oil. I believe that is the main ingredient for leaving my hair looking and feeling amazing. I would give this product 10 stars if I could. I am very picky about hair products, this is a keeper for me, very glad I found it here on Amazon cheaper !!</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair.  The woman who cut my hair suggested I use this to soften my hair.  It works very nicely and has a lovely smell.  My hair has a bit more shine as well.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I used to buy it from Ulta  and on here costs 1/2 of what Ulta charges. I didn&#x27;t have any issues with the product and plan to order more.</li>
            <li> I have curly and frizzy hair. This product helped to tame the frizz and give new life to my curls. The oil makes my hair very shiny and protects against the heat.  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I only use a little bit of it on my hair after shampooing. It&#x27;s unbelievable how soft and shiny my hair is right after applying the oil. My hair is dry from having perms. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all. The price of this product was less than a hair salon.</li>
            <li> I first discovered this when my hair stylist used it on me.  GREAT PRODUCT!  It is light enough I can even use it near my root for flyaways!</li>
