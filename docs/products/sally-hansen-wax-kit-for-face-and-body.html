    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I did it perfectly correctly, but the wax WILL NOT stick to hairs!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Otherwise good luck!!</li>
            <li>It has a very pleasant smell but what good is that when the product doesn&#x27;t do the job it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>It does smell great</li>
            <li>seems good</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a good company.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it does smell good, but who cares if this product doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells good.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing because it&#x27;s a sugar based wax</li>
            <li>On the pro side it smells nice and washes off with water.</li>
            <li>This is honestly s</li>
            <li>Unless I just got the lucky batch lol.</li>
            <li>My arm is as clean as can be leaving my skin feel smooth and smelling good!    </li>
            <li>If you are expecting a great review about this product you should stop reading right now.</li>
            <li>Was I more upset about the $150 or that I still had hair?</li>
            <li>However, I think they discontinued that product because I haven&#x27;t been able to find it</li>
            <li>No matter how many times I&#x27;ve tried it did not pull the hair out.</li>
            <li>but it did not remove many hairs either.</li>
            <li>and I now have some lovely palm sized bruises that I&#x27;m hoping an ice pack can help with.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I probably won&#x27;t be trying this again anytime soon.</li>
            <li>I used to wax with (Nair microwavable wax) and I love it</li>
            <li>Ok to the point..</li>
            <li>I am very familiar with waxing.  </li>
            <li>However, if you are expecting an honest and bold review then please continue reading.</li>
            <li>it correctly, as instructed on dry hair, and it will work GREAT!</li>
            <li>The wax has a beige-silk color and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It comes off easily with water, but the point is to remove hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pain free because it can&#x27;t pull any hair.</li>
            <li>so it washes right off, but it does not pull any hair!</li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t even stick to the strip well enough for me to get a good pull with it.  </li>
            <li>This product is trash the only thing it&#x27;s good for is the scent.</li>
            <li>But from previous experience it&#x27;s a great product, is smells yummy.</li>
            <li>Like instructed , i used the tool and applied the wax on my arm and on the first try I got it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the Sally Hansen extra strength body wax kit, and that works 100x better!</li>
            <li>Also, if you use the pre wipes make sure you give it time to FULLY DRY before the wax process so that the wax will adhere better to your hairs.    </li>
            <li>But its ok :) just as long as it works!!    </li>
            <li>The only thing I liked about this kit were the pre-waxing wipes, which worked well with my epilator which I had to use after I attempted to use this kit.  </li>
            <li>It smells really nice, but that&#x27;s about the only positive of this product.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice that you don&#x27;t have to microwave it much, but I need a body wax that actually works.</li>
            <li>Also, the gunk that was left when I tried to pull off the strips did wipe clean pretty easily with water.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li>&amp; I pulled the strip, all I got was wax &amp; most of it left on my under arm.</li>
            <li>I tried again after washing it off with a much thinner layer, you could not see the color of the wax, &amp; again!</li>
            <li>I tried it on my bikini line first - nothing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a waist of money I used it exactly as it says and it removed no hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used the white chocolate, and this wax now for years and LOVE them both.</li>
            <li>I bought this because my store stopped carrying Sally Hansen Extra Strength All-Over Body Wax, which I love.</li>
            <li>So, this was my first time waxing myself.</li>
            <li>, I still think it is the best, but unfortunately they stopped selling it.</li>
            <li>Over all im satisfied with my purchase.roduct next month when im out of school .</li>
            <li>how many times you try the same spot.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as regular wax, but that&#x27;s probably because it was leaving most of my hair in place.  </li>
            <li>So I practically waxed the whole side of my left arm and the residue was easily washed off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m returning it as fast as I can.  </li>
            <li>I did not feel much pain</li>
            <li>2.place wax strip over the area and with your palm, stroke the paper in the same direction of hair growth for 10-15 seconds or until you think its warm enough</li>
            <li>I purchased this at a local pharmacy and was excited to try it.</li>
            <li>It took multiple passes with clean wax strips to remove all the wax from my skin, but not the hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The wax does wash off with warm water which makes cleanup very easy, it smells great, is slightly less painful and my skin is not nearly as red or tender afterwards, but I would trade pain for effectiveness any day when it comes hair removal.</li>
            <li>Now, from the end of the wax strip that is the OPPOSITE of the direction of hair growth, pull fast and quickly.</li>
            <li>I have a Sally Hansen wax that I usually use, but the store was out, so I picked this up, figuring that it would be as effective.  </li>
            <li>You pull RIGHT ALONG- PARALLEL</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s complete garbage!</li>
            <li>However, it does not pull out hair and you end up with a huge sticky mess on your skin.</li>
            <li>The only pro about this, is that it smells really</li>
            <li>not waste your money.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li>I tried the paper strips and the cloth strips that came with the old kit, but the wax sticks to your skin not the strips.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It went directly to the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li>If the hair is not the right length, or wet, or you gob it on, you&#x27;re doing it wrong.&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li>The directions include a trouble shooting section as to why the hair isn&#x27;t removed, and I made sure to follow each one, but still could not get the same results as the Extra Strength Wax.&lt;br</li>
            <li>To me, the frustration of having to rewax an area several times to get minimal results isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>, Sally&#x27;s Wax gets 1 sad star from BayBold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: Sally gives more Ouch than Relief!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used strips, I&#x27;ve used regular wax, I&#x27;ve been professionally waxed.  </li>
            <li>I have had my upper lip professionally waxed for years, so I know the process.  </li>
            <li>I warmed wax for as long as it says, did the normal waxing-</li>
            <li>It has a creamy consistency that never gets hard or dry to be able to remove it.  </li>
            <li>When I pull the strip off, there&#x27;s always a layer of the wax left over and barely any hairs come off.</li>
            <li>ended up not getting past my right shin</li>
            <li>I bought it because the store was out of the kind I usually get, \\&quot;Sally Hansen Extra Strength All-Over Body Wax Kit\\&quot;, and I expected the same hair removal results but with less pain.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;d only experienced waxing one other time at Tigli Tan and I didn&#x27;t think it was so bad.</li>
            <li> The wax does not remove cleanly and leaves patches of wax and hair behind.</li>
            <li> After my visit to European Wax Center</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I tried on a few different spots and all the same thing-</li>
            <li> So this is not new to me.</li>
            <li> It did not pull out a single hair.  </li>
            <li> and it did not take off a single hair.  </li>
            <li> Not one single hair came out, not one.</li>
            <li> I even tried some eyebrow shaping and again, it didn&#x27;t manage to pluck a single hair out.</li>
            <li> I tried it in my legs and underarms and did not pull a single hair.</li>
            <li> The wax is too liquid and didn&#x27;t pull a single hair out.</li>
            <li> It looks and feels the same, but it does not come off on the strips and it does NOT remove hair like their previous wax did.</li>
            <li> It does not remove hair and only makes a sticky mess.</li>
            <li> I totally wasted ten bucks buying this.</li>
            <li> I figured that the hair there is probably coarser and harder to remove</li>
            <li> Maybe my hair is too coarse and thick for the Ouch-Relief wax which is why it doesn&#x27;t work as well, but I&#x27;m throwing the wax out and saving the strips for when I find another Extra Strength Kit.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not worth a single penny, it does not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I picked up maybe 5 hairs throughout for endless attempts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sally Hansen for other things</li>
            <li> Apply it until you cant drag the tool against your skin anymore!).</li>
            <li> The only saving grace was that the pre-wax wipes really did work well to numb the area.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worse than failing to pull out any hairs, because it actually mostly just broke my hairs, making it impossible to rewax the leg properly.  </li>
            <li> product is not worth a penny.</li>
            <li> Because I didn&#x27;t want to waste my money, I literally spent hours just trying to wax my arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It just laid on you skin like a gooey mess.  </li>
            <li> It was super bad for me.</li>
            <li> It did not remove any hair and it was super painful.  </li>
            <li> they snapped off leaving a little hair nub that I have to remove with tweezers.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d looked it up before spending $10 at walmart for this rubbish waste of time.</li>
            <li> WASTE OF MONEY unless you like hair and pain.</li>
            <li> otherwise it&#x27;s practically a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I would give it a zero, but that option was not available.</li>
            <li> it is messy</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I wasted over 10 bucks on this piece of *</li>
            <li> It was a waste of time and money.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is applying the wax so thinly</li>
            <li> , I happened to pull a few hair strands along the way.</li>
            <li> You can rinse this wax off your skin with plain water, that should tell you something.</li>
            <li> I pulled a few hairs, but not many (maybe 15-20%), and broke another 50% after that.  </li>
            <li> I tried thick thin as I could get it and nothing worked the only reason I got the 20% off</li>
            <li> It was messy and sticky, but hardly pulled out a hair at all.</li>
            <li> I wax at home often, usually with Nair Sugar Wax kit.  </li>
            <li> I ran out of the usual sally Hansen wax I use and picked this up.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I tried from very thin layer to thick layer and the result is the same.</li>
            <li> This wax picks up hardly any hairs and leaves a sticky residue.</li>
            <li> the wax will stick to your skin and you will have a hard time to remove it from your skin.  </li>
            <li> but lately I had a hard time finding them.</li>
            <li> I would give negative stars if I could.&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> This was the biggest waste of money ever!!!  </li>
            <li> The instructions recommend to apply a thin layer of wax on your skin.</li>
            <li> This was the absolute worst of the bunch.</li>
            <li> spread a THIN layer.</li>
            <li> 1.apply a thin layer (and by thin I mean paper thin!</li>
            <li> I just brought my wax kit from walmart not knowing what I was getting myself into until I read all the bad reviews on amazon and a few from ulta and makeupalley.com.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, it did pull some hair out, maybe 3 strands.</li>
            <li> I took a chance on this one and I am sorry I did.</li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> Sadly, self-waxing doesn&#x27;t seem to be as easy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Before you plan to throw it away try it again because you&#x27;re just doing it wrong.</li>
            <li> Very poor product.  </li>
            <li> I read the instructions and applied a very thin layer in the direction of hair growth and applied the strip against hair growth as suggested by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so mad I even tried it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely terrible, a waste of money!</li>
            <li> To bad.</li>
            <li> I had to return this kit because it is laughably bad.</li>
            <li> , you spread it on, put the sheet over it, rub it and pull, it hurts so bad</li>
            <li> I was sad that out of all products I purchased, it had to be the one with worst ratings.</li>
            <li> Boy was I an idiot.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> It was horrible.</li>
            <li> This replacement wax is horrific.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I wax at home often, usually with Nair Sugar Wax kit.  The store was out of Nair so I bought this.  It did not pull out a single hair.  It just laid on you skin like a gooey mess.  This was the biggest waste of money ever!!!  I&#x27;ve used strips, I&#x27;ve used regular wax, I&#x27;ve been professionally waxed.  I am very familiar with waxing.  This was a joke.</li>
            <li> If you are expecting a great review about this product you should stop reading right now. However, if you are expecting an honest and bold review then please continue reading. After my visit to European Wax Center I felt about $150 lighter and still had hair left on parts of my body. Was I more upset about the $150 or that I still had hair? The hair of course!! After that unsatisfying experience I was determined to find a DIY wax kit - I found Sally Hansen&#x27;s Ouch Relief Wax Kit and it was even on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome! Or so I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is not worth a penny. The wax has a beige-silk color and is easy to apply. However, it does not pull out hair and you end up with a huge sticky mess on your skin. The instructions recommend to apply a thin layer of wax on your skin. I tried from very thin layer to thick layer and the result is the same. Very poor product.  Out of 5 stars, Sally&#x27;s Wax gets 1 sad star from BayBold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: Sally gives more Ouch than Relief!</li>
            <li> I cannot believe I bought this. It was horrible. I picked up maybe 5 hairs throughout for endless attempts. The only pro about this, is that it smells really good.&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I also know how to wax....this did not grab anything!!! It wouldn&#x27;t even stick to the strip well enough for me to get a good pull with it.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.  I&#x27;m returning it as fast as I can.  I&#x27;m so mad I even tried it.</li>
            <li> Bottom Line: inconsistant hair removal; leaves lots of stray hairs and wax behind&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed with this product. I bought it because the store was out of the kind I usually get, \\&quot;Sally Hansen Extra Strength All-Over Body Wax Kit\\&quot;, and I expected the same hair removal results but with less pain. Not even close. The wax does not remove cleanly and leaves patches of wax and hair behind. It took multiple passes with clean wax strips to remove all the wax from my skin, but not the hair. To get the hair, I ended up having to re-wax the same area several times and some hairs weren&#x27;t even pulled out by the roots- they snapped off leaving a little hair nub that I have to remove with tweezers. The directions include a trouble shooting section as to why the hair isn&#x27;t removed, and I made sure to follow each one, but still could not get the same results as the Extra Strength Wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax does wash off with warm water which makes cleanup very easy, it smells great, is slightly less painful and my skin is not nearly as red or tender afterwards, but I would trade pain for effectiveness any day when it comes hair removal. To me, the frustration of having to rewax an area several times to get minimal results isn&#x27;t worth it. I got through waxing my left shin and calf before I got fed up and called it quits. Maybe my hair is too coarse and thick for the Ouch-Relief wax which is why it doesn&#x27;t work as well, but I&#x27;m throwing the wax out and saving the strips for when I find another Extra Strength Kit.</li>
            <li> I totally wasted ten bucks buying this. It smells really nice, but that&#x27;s about the only positive of this product. I did it perfectly correctly, but the wax WILL NOT stick to hairs!!!!!! I pulled TWO hairs.</li>
            <li> I would give negative stars if I could.&lt;br /&gt;How did this product get on the market?&lt;br /&gt;Removes zero hair.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It was super bad for me. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I doesn&#x27; work at all. It didn&#x27;t pull even a hair for me. To bad. It just leave you bruises</li>
            <li> This does not work at all.  I have had my upper lip professionally waxed for years, so I know the process.  I read the instructions thoroughly, did all the steps and it did not take off a single hair.  Started over, tried again, nothing.  Can not recommend it at all.</li>
            <li> I wish I could rate this product no stars! Who did this company test this on?? It doesn&#x27;t work at all!! Not one single hair came out, not one. I&#x27;ve been waxing under my arms for over 6 years. I ran out of the usual sally Hansen wax I use and picked this up. It&#x27;s a complete waste of money. Do not waste your money on this product. You can rinse this wax off your skin with plain water, that should tell you something. It&#x27;s pain free because it can&#x27;t pull any hair. I&#x27;m returning this tomorrow. It&#x27;s complete garbage!</li>
            <li> Never recieved the product.  But from previous experience it&#x27;s a great product, is smells yummy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing using drugstore-bought wax for years, and I&#x27;ve tried several methods and products. This was the absolute worst of the bunch. I followed the directions exactly. It was messy and sticky, but hardly pulled out a hair at all. The only saving grace was that the pre-wax wipes really did work well to numb the area. Also, the gunk that was left when I tried to pull off the strips did wipe clean pretty easily with water. However, since the wax only got maybe a tenth of the hair that was there, this is a product I would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I think I might even give this zero stars if I could. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever been this displeased with a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been waxing for quite a while now so I know how to use wax. I always used the Nair microwavable wax (with wax strips). However, I think they discontinued that product because I haven&#x27;t been able to find it anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, after futile searching for Nair&#x27;s wax, I decided to try this wax out, thinking, &amp;#34;it seems good, it&#x27;s a good company. I&#x27;ve used Sally Hansen for other things before.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a mistake. The wax does not work. When I pull the strip off, there&#x27;s always a layer of the wax left over and barely any hairs come off. Because I didn&#x27;t want to waste my money, I literally spent hours just trying to wax my arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only posting a review to warn others not to use this.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t buy this. The two five star reviews have got to be paid for. I wish I&#x27;d looked it up before spending $10 at walmart for this rubbish waste of time. Ditto what everyone else said. NO hairs came out. End of story.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions step by step and I already know how to do body waxes since I do a bikini wax every spring/summer! So this is not new to me. So I saw it was \\&quot;Ouch-Free\\&quot; (bull!)so I decided to try it out. It comes with wipes that are the \\&quot;Ouch-Free wipes\\&quot; that you rub on 10 minutes before you start the waxing. Made NO difference. I warmed wax for as long as it says, did the normal waxing- I put on the wax, rub the paper 2 or 3 times, then pull opposite of hair growth. Did not pull any hair up at all! Just left gooey wax all over and now I have purple bruises. I tried on a few different spots and all the same thing- nothing but gooey wax left over and bruises as a result. I think I am going to stick with my regular \\&quot;Nair bikini wax\\&quot; after my soreness and bruises fade away.</li>
            <li> I have been home waxing for over 15 years, and just ran out of my stock pile of Sally Hansen Express Wax Water Rinsable Formula. This replacement wax is horrific. It looks and feels the same, but it does not come off on the strips and it does NOT remove hair like their previous wax did. I tried the paper strips and the cloth strips that came with the old kit, but the wax sticks to your skin not the strips. It comes off easily with water, but the point is to remove hair and it doesn&#x27;t. I tried going over the same area 3 times and it still only removed 20% of hair and I was screaming in pain. A teenager warned me that it didn&#x27;t work at the store, but I needed a bikini wax before vacation and have always used Sally Hansen so I blew her off. Boy was I an idiot. I had purple bruises and had to use tweezers for an hour to get the job done. WASTE OF MONEY unless you like hair and pain.</li>
            <li> I wish i could give it &amp;#34;0&amp;#34;.It doesn&#x27;t work at all, don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> I use waxing products all the time. I just used this today on 2-2-14 and it got like 20 % of the hair out I tried thick thin as I could get it and nothing worked the only reason I got the 20% off is cause I kept going over it. Needs to be thicker. I personally have a problem every time with any sally hansen products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing my underarms myself for over 2 years. This product is HORRIBLE! It smells amazing because it&#x27;s a sugar based wax so it washes right off, but it does not pull any hair! What&#x27;s the point of a waxing kit if the wax doesn&#x27;t work? I initially put on a semi-thick layer, the directions said you should see the hair. DONE &amp; I pulled the strip, all I got was wax &amp; most of it left on my under arm. I tried again after washing it off with a much thinner layer, you could not see the color of the wax, &amp; again! I pulled the strip and there is NO hair on the strip! Just wax! No matter how many times I&#x27;ve tried it did not pull the hair out. I&#x27;m sorry, it did pull some hair out, maybe 3 strands. I&#x27;d like to also mention that I had washed my pits, alcohol swabbed them &amp; tried with &amp; without baby powder. This product is trash the only thing it&#x27;s good for is the scent. Save your time, money &amp; frustration.</li>
            <li> This product does not work as advertised. It does not remove hair and only makes a sticky mess. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at a local pharmacy and was excited to try it. I read the instructions and applied a very thin layer in the direction of hair growth and applied the strip against hair growth as suggested by the manufacturer. I did not feel much pain but it did not remove many hairs either. On the pro side it smells nice and washes off with water. otherwise it&#x27;s practically a waste of money. Will not buy again, would not recommend...</li>
            <li> I used to use Nair&#x27;s sugar wax kits but lately I had a hard time finding them. I took a chance on this one and I am sorry I did. It doesn&#x27;t remove hair at all! It stuck to my skin and would just pull on it but not come off (or take any of the hair with it). It has a very pleasant smell but what good is that when the product doesn&#x27;t do the job it&#x27;s supposed to. I tried it on my bikini line first - nothing. I figured that the hair there is probably coarser and harder to remove so I tried it on my arm - nothing. I even tried some eyebrow shaping and again, it didn&#x27;t manage to pluck a single hair out.</li>
            <li> This product does not work.  I followed all the directions and I&#x27;ve used home wax kit for years.  What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> This is honestly s***. Does not work at all. It&#x27;s a waist of money I used it exactly as it says and it removed no hair. AND the pain relief does not relieve pain. So you&#x27;re basically in pain while the wax removes no hair and leaves your skin red.Don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> This used to be the White Chocolate wax. No heat necessary, cleans up with water, smells divine, and works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;You spread a THIN layer. You pull RIGHT ALONG- PARALLEL TO, (NOT up and away from) the skin.&lt;br /&gt;If you pull perpendicularly it can bruise you. This is all in the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the white chocolate, and this wax now for years and LOVE them both. If the hair is not the right length, or wet, or you gob it on, you&#x27;re doing it wrong.&lt;br /&gt;Use it correctly, as instructed on dry hair, and it will work GREAT!</li>
            <li> I bought this because my store stopped carrying Sally Hansen Extra Strength All-Over Body Wax, which I love. I had to return this kit because it is laughably bad. This wax picks up hardly any hairs and leaves a sticky residue. It does smell great and it&#x27;s nice that you don&#x27;t have to microwave it much, but I need a body wax that actually works.</li>
            <li> I would give it a zero, but that option was not available. I read all the directions, even watched the video in youtube. After doing all this:&lt;br /&gt;1. it irritated my skin&lt;br /&gt;2. it missed 90% of the hair&lt;br /&gt;3. it missed 100% of the upper lip hair&lt;br /&gt;4. it is so liquid, it dripped on my shirt and ruined it&lt;br /&gt;5. it is messy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it does smell good, but who cares if this product doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It went directly to the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sally Hansen should reimburse us all because there is no way it worked for anybody.</li>
            <li> This wax did nothing for me. I tried it in my legs and underarms and did not pull a single hair. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I would give this a 0 if I could. I wasted over 10 bucks on this piece of **** wax kit in store, and all I want is my money back. It removes NO hair, it DOES NOT relieve pain. Useless. I&#x27;m so pissed. Upside? It smells good. Thats. It.</li>
            <li> So, this was my first time waxing myself. I&#x27;d only experienced waxing one other time at Tigli Tan and I didn&#x27;t think it was so bad. Sadly, self-waxing doesn&#x27;t seem to be as easy.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up not getting past my right shin and I now have some lovely palm sized bruises that I&#x27;m hoping an ice pack can help with.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I probably won&#x27;t be trying this again anytime soon.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible.  It deserves 0 stars.  It did not remove any hair and it was super painful.  It was a waste of time and money.  the wax will stick to your skin and you will have a hard time to remove it from your skin.  It has a creamy consistency that never gets hard or dry to be able to remove it.  Avoid this product !!!!!!</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.  I have been waxing for 20 years, so I know wax,  don&#x27;t think that I didn&#x27;t know how to use it. I used to wax with (Nair microwavable wax) and I love it, I still think it is the best, but unfortunately they stopped selling it. So I decided to try this one (Sally Hansen No Ouch) the self proclaimed \\&quot;#1 wax brand\\&quot;  and it&#x27;s not worth a single penny, it does not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-  It is so gooey, you spread it on, put the sheet over it, rub it and pull, it hurts so bad, my skin was so red almost about to bleed, as for the hair, nothing came off NOTHING! so now I have to repeat this, over the irritated skin again.  And again nothing happens, no hair comes out, but my skin is bleeding, so you get the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the wax is in the garbage where it belongs, this is like throwing $10 in the trash can. Don&#x27;t buy it, that is my advice to you.</li>
            <li> The only thing I liked about this kit were the pre-waxing wipes, which worked well with my epilator which I had to use after I attempted to use this kit.  The wax is too liquid and didn&#x27;t pull a single hair out.</li>
            <li> Before you plan to throw it away try it again because you&#x27;re just doing it wrong. I just brought my wax kit from walmart not knowing what I was getting myself into until I read all the bad reviews on amazon and a few from ulta and makeupalley.com. I was sad that out of all products I purchased, it had to be the one with worst ratings. But I thought hey why not give it a try before returning it, they wont know I used it until someone purchases it hehhe. Ok to the point.. I didnt bother to use the pre wipes since I didnt want to open the package of I was going to return it. Like instructed , i used the tool and applied the wax on my arm and on the first try I got it! I wanted to post pictures on here for proof but I guess there isnt an option . So I practically waxed the whole side of my left arm and the residue was easily washed off. My arm is as clean as can be leaving my skin feel smooth and smelling good!    HERE IS WHAT I DID:  1.apply a thin layer (and by thin I mean paper thin! Apply it until you cant drag the tool against your skin anymore!). Also,  APPLY IN THE DIRECTION OF HAIR GROWTH.  2.place wax strip over the area and with your palm, stroke the paper in the same direction of hair growth for 10-15 seconds or until you think its warm enough (this makes it so its unecessary to microwave your wax).  3. Now, from the end of the wax strip that is the OPPOSITE of the direction of hair growth, pull fast and quickly. And voila!    This should work! Unless I just got the lucky batch lol. However, don&#x27;t give up. Also, if you use the pre wipes make sure you give it time to FULLY DRY before the wax process so that the wax will adhere better to your hairs.    The only downside is applying the wax so thinly, I happened to pull a few hair strands along the way. But its ok :) just as long as it works!!    Over all im satisfied with my purchase.roduct next month when im out of school . search for the username kubda. Otherwise good luck!!</li>
            <li> I bought mine from Walmart and it left 70-80% of the hair when you pull no matter how many times you try the same spot. It&#x27;s absolutely terrible, a waste of money! I cannot believe they sell this garbage! I&#x27;ve tried the Sally Hansen extra strength body wax kit, and that works 100x better! I&#x27;m going back to that one... Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> This wax is a fraud. Doesn&#x27;t harden and of course doesn&#x27;t remove hair. Should not be sold and marketed.</li>
            <li> I have a Sally Hansen wax that I usually use, but the store was out, so I picked this up, figuring that it would be as effective.  It&#x27;s worse than failing to pull out any hairs, because it actually mostly just broke my hairs, making it impossible to rewax the leg properly.  I pulled a few hairs, but not many (maybe 15-20%), and broke another 50% after that.  Doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as regular wax, but that&#x27;s probably because it was leaving most of my hair in place.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
