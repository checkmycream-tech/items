    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I have read the reviews of hands turning color and the best thing to do when using any self tanner</li>
            <li>Beautiful tan!!</li>
            <li>Because it was perfect!  </li>
            <li>and it was the very best that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>It was perfect while at the beach because I try to stay out of the sun when I&#x27;m not in the water or walking the beach.</li>
            <li>This is the best self tanner on the market!  </li>
            <li>I ordered what I thought was just the self tanner, I heard great reviews from Yahoo that this was one of the best Self tanners of 2013.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, very pleasant smell by its self.</li>
            <li>but this product has allowed me to use it everywhere and looks great.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Awesome color not fake looking at all!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best on the market and so easy to use</li>
            <li>Wonderful  LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>I have a tendency to turn orange with ANY kind of bronzer or self tanner.  </li>
            <li>Just a warm tan glow.  </li>
            <li>Great pricing and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I WAS HOPING IT WOULD DARKEN MORE.</li>
            <li>Have not been able to use it yet but did try a test spot</li>
            <li>Ive always used Tan Towels and thought I would give this product a try and am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>Love Love Love this product</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product...provides that gentle shading of wintery white skin to a healthy glow without having to confess how you did it!</li>
            <li>and it looks great so far.</li>
            <li>I have tried them all, the best self tanner is Hempz pure herbal extracts - Touch of Summer daily moisturizer ($18.50 for 8 oz tube).  </li>
            <li>I was so excited.</li>
            <li>You have to buy the right bottle!  </li>
            <li>It made my skin feel soft, and the smell was nice.</li>
            <li>love this stuff doesn&#x27;t break my skin out as much very natural looking tan</li>
            <li>I don&amp;#34;t feel this product is worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Does last well and cover very light skin.</li>
            <li>But when I ordered this I didn&#x27;t realize there are levels of the self tanner and that this was not the first level.</li>
            <li>Its cheaper then the first level extender.</li>
            <li>when you first put it on you see nothing.</li>
            <li>but when you do you start looking too orange....which I think happens with most tanning products, I was just hoping this one was different.</li>
            <li>Think it would work better on someone who is very, very white.</li>
            <li>The most important thing to do is always exfoliate your entire body before you use a self tanner that is the key.</li>
            <li>HOW MUCH DO I HAVE TO PUT ON?</li>
            <li>Light even application is key.</li>
            <li>After applying every day for a week, I really expected a better darker color, I was a smidge on the orange side...</li>
            <li>It has given me the most natural tan and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all.</li>
            <li>I have not had it long enough to find out if it actually extends my tan, but so far it is great.</li>
            <li>but I always get streaking and the color isn&#x27;t as realistic as this.</li>
            <li>This won&#x27;t give you a deep dark tan but will provide nice realistic looking color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok but for that price... is not ok..  </li>
            <li>AT ALL SO NATURAL LOOKING!  </li>
            <li>the regular cream  &amp;#34;Natural Glow from Jergen&#x27;s &amp;#34; is much cheaper and has the &amp;#34;same&amp;#34; results.  </li>
            <li>NO justification for such high price..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised by this product, especially after reading some of the reviews.</li>

            <li> I really expected a miracle self tanner after reading all the reviews on this product.</li>

            <li> I WAS HOPING IT WOULD DARKEN MORE. HOW MUCH DO I HAVE TO PUT ON?</li>
            <li> As it mentions on the label,have to be careful around the ankles. Does last well and cover very light skin.</li>
            <li> I received my product on 6/6/15. Have not been able to use it yet but did try a test spot and it looks great so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best on the market and so easy to use also does what it says</li>
            <li> Who ever said will not turn you orange is color blind 2nd time I applied I was orange as can be  total waste of money</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but for that price... is not ok..  the regular cream  &amp;#34;Natural Glow from Jergen&#x27;s &amp;#34; is much cheaper and has the &amp;#34;same&amp;#34; results.  Dissapointed.. besides we thought it was spray.  NO justification for such high price..</li>
            <li> This product worked just as it said it would. I have a tendency to turn orange with ANY kind of bronzer or self tanner.  Not with this.  I would buy it again and recommend it.</li>
            <li> I ordered what I thought was just the self tanner, I heard great reviews from Yahoo that this was one of the best Self tanners of 2013. But when I ordered this I didn&#x27;t realize there are levels of the self tanner and that this was not the first level. Its cheaper then the first level extender. I don&#x27;t have time to return the order so I am stuck with it...</li>
            <li> Not a good color.  Has that weird smell too.  I Wish I hadn&#x27;t bought it. Waste of my hard-earned money $$$</li>
            <li> Awesome color not fake looking at all!!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful  LOVE LOVE LOVE IT   NOOT ORANGE AT ALL SO NATURAL LOOKING!  WILL REORDER</li>
            <li> I turned ORANGE, this product is AWFUL.</li>
            <li> Excellent product...provides that gentle shading of wintery white skin to a healthy glow without having to confess how you did it!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, very pleasant smell by its self. I have not had it long enough to find out if it actually extends my tan, but so far it is great.</li>
            <li> Ive always used Tan Towels and thought I would give this product a try and am so glad I did. It has given me the most natural tan and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all. The most important thing to do is always exfoliate your entire body before you use a self tanner that is the key. I was never able to use salt tanners on my elbows, knees or ankles because the skin there has always been dryer then th rest of my body but this product has allowed me to use it everywhere and looks great. I have read the reviews of hands turning color and the best thing to do when using any self tanner is use rubber gloves each time and you won&#x27;t have to worry about your hands turning color. Love Love Love this product, thank you Tan Physics!</li>
            <li> this is just lotion there are no tanning extending capabilities in this bottle- save your money and put iodine in some baby oil.</li>
            <li> Love it.  And no spell</li>
            <li> I don&amp;#34;t feel this product is worth the cost. My mistake in purchasing it.</li>
            <li> love this stuff doesn&#x27;t break my skin out as much very natural looking tan</li>
            <li> Works well, no disappointments.</li>
            <li> Beautiful tan!! Great product.</li>
            <li> Because it was perfect!  I&#x27;ve tried them all and it was the very best that I have ever used.  Thank you for creating it!</li>
            <li> I didnt like the Orange color!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.  I have tried them all, the best self tanner is Hempz pure herbal extracts - Touch of Summer daily moisturizer ($18.50 for 8 oz tube).  No orange, no streaks.  Just a warm tan glow.  Once desired shade is reached, use every other day.</li>
            <li> At first I thought I had purchased the wrong product. I thought it was just a lotion rather than a tanner because the bottle is confusing and when you first put it on you see nothing. BUT, it gradually added color to my skin with no streaking. I was so excited. It was perfect while at the beach because I try to stay out of the sun when I&#x27;m not in the water or walking the beach. So I would put this on and it looked like I was getting tan even though I didn&#x27;t spend all of the time in the sun it would take to get the tan. If you put it on too heavy you will get streaking and it will look orange. Light even application is key. Just wash hands with soap and water after and you won&#x27;t have a problem. This won&#x27;t give you a deep dark tan but will provide nice realistic looking color. I&#x27;ve tried much more less expensive brands but I always get streaking and the color isn&#x27;t as realistic as this. I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised by this product, especially after reading some of the reviews. I gave it 4 stars only because I do wish you could gradually go darker with it but when you do you start looking too orange....which I think happens with most tanning products, I was just hoping this one was different.</li>
            <li> I really expected a miracle self tanner after reading all the reviews on this product. After applying every day for a week, I really expected a better darker color, I was a smidge on the orange side... I wouldn&#x27;t rate this a 5 star in my case especially for the price!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t like Tan Physics. I hardly got any color. I know how to apply it correctly, so it wasn&#x27;t the application. It just gave off no color. It made my skin feel soft, and the smell was nice. But that was about it. I feel like I spent alot of money, for just some skin cream. Think it would work better on someone who is very, very white.</li>
            <li> This is the best self tanner on the market!  Ladies- DUH!  You have to buy the right bottle!  I&#x27;ll never use another product than this!</li>
            <li> Just what the wife wanted! Great pricing and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I put it in the trash, used one time.</li>
    </ol>
