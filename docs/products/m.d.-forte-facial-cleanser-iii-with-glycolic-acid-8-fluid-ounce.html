            <li>Makes a wonderful difference in skin tone and texture.  </li>
            <li>I use it with my Clairsonic Brush after cleansing my skin and it is awesome.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the best at removing all my makeup</li>
            <li>This product is great, depending on how you use it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for many years as it works acceptionally well, but can&#x27;t believe the price now!!</li>
            <li>Great exfoliator leaves skin very clean.</li>
            <li>Love this!  </li>
            <li>Never found anything better than this!</li>
            <li>This is more than it used to cost at my dermatologist office!</li>
            <li>Fabulous stuff!</li>
            <li>I think of this product as more of a &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; product, sort of a mini-peel.  </li>
            <li>love the price here.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for many years as recommended by my skin doctor.</li>
            <li>I love this product as I have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>so I am sure there are newer ones out there</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to a strong concentration of Glycolic Acid</li>
            <li>Leaves skin so smooth and clean, has helped reduce my acne</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I finally something that is effective</li>
            <li>Bought this for my wife and she swears by it to clean her face</li>
            <li>This is a great product that is an old standby that I keep coming back to for my oily acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>/wipe first or use only in the morning when my face is makeup free.  </li>
            <li>It was replaced with a cheap facial cleaner.</li>
            <li>and you can really feel it work.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried quite a few products myself over the years, but this is the first time I am completely satisfied with the results over the long term.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and restively wrinkle-free for my age.</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re not or if you have sensitive skin, you should go with either lighter versions of this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and have never&lt;br /&gt;had</li>
            <li>My pores are smaller, clearer, wrinkles are less, and I have less breakouts (I&#x27;m pushing 40, fair, oily skin).  </li>
            <li>I keep trying new stuff but always come back to this as the ole&#x27; standby!</li>
            <li>I have used for years and when I finally run out will be looking for a similar product for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>However, since using this cleanser over a few months I have no more problems, just a very clean and glowing complexion.</li>

            <li> but kinda afraid to risk $30 and not be pleased.  </li>
            <li> Because I don&#x27;t use it as my cleanser, it lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> I put DDWR3 on dry skin</li>
            <li> The last time I purchased it, it was less than $40.00.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and feel it helps keep my skin from looking aged.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for at least ten years</li>
            <li> Instead I&#x27;ve been using DermaDoctor Wrinkle Revenge 3 for about a year; it&#x27;s less than 1/2 the price.  </li>
            <li> This purchase though was flat without the usual cleansing feeling I usually get from it.</li>
            <li> Sadly I have to search for a new product.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the price to wash your face!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times</li>
            <li> I read quite a few testimonials for this product online from women who have been using it for years when I selected it.</li>
            <li> In fact, I noticed the difference within a few days.</li>
            <li> so I usually use a makeup removing cloth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m considering trying Glytone exfoliating gel wash as it is unbuffered glycolic acid at 4.7% (not sure how that equates to 30% buffered...)</li>
            <li> I needed to use three times the amount to get a small cleaning tingle.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous!</li>
            <li> Crazy times if someone is buying this at this price.</li>
            <li> That is outrageous price!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used this product for years and feel it helps keep my skin from looking aged. My skin is soft and restively wrinkle-free for my age.</li>
            <li> It was not M.D. Forte cleaner. It was replaced with a cheap facial cleaner. what a rip_off.f</li>
            <li> I like the product however it is no longer made so this was my last purchase of the product</li>
            <li> Love this!  Makes a wonderful difference in skin tone and texture.  Please understand that this not for use by anyone who has never used Formulations I or II as your skin needs to become accustomed to it.  I&#x27;ve used glycolic acid and alpha hydroxy cleansers on my face for some time and had to stop about 2 yrs ago.  My skin tone suffered.  I&#x27;ve been using this for just over a week and I can see a difference already.  Fabulous stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I finally something that is effective and I can get it without waiting in the doctor&#x27;s office and wasting time.</li>
            <li> This product is great, depending on how you use it.  It does not work well in removing eye makeup so I use a different cleanser to remove my makeup.  I think of this product as more of a &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; product, sort of a mini-peel.  I use it with my Clairsonic Brush after cleansing my skin and it is awesome.  I&#x27;m used to a strong concentration of Glycolic Acid but if you&#x27;re not or if you have sensitive skin, you should go with either lighter versions of this cleanser.  My skin looks brighter and my pores appear smaller since using this product.  Because I don&#x27;t use it as my cleanser, it lasts a really long time. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This cleanser was recommended to be by my derm office.  love the price here. I&#x27;ve used this a few times (I tend to always switch and try different things) I come back to this one often.  Don&#x27;t expect this to lather up. Great exfoliator leaves skin very clean.</li>
            <li> I have been using MD Forte Facial Cleanser III for over 10 years.  The last time I purchased it, it was less than $40.00.&lt;br /&gt;What the heck happened???</li>
            <li> This is a great product that is an old standby that I keep coming back to for my oily acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for many years as recommended by my skin doctor. I have extremely sensitive skin and have never&lt;br /&gt;had a problem with this product.</li>
            <li> Using since 1994. Recommended by Board Certified. FAC surgeon. Start with MD Forte I and titrate up to Level III</li>
            <li> I love this product as I have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and it was $30.00. Now it&#x27;s $72.00????? Not worth the price to wash your face!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for at least ten years and I love it. So sad that this will no longer be available!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and she swears by it to clean her face</li>
            <li> Never found anything better than this!</li>
            <li> Leaves skin so smooth and clean, has helped reduce my acne</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  Wouldn&#x27;t dream of being without it!</li>
            <li> this product has been around for years so I am sure there are newer ones out there but I&#x27;ve used this for years and it works.  I keep trying new stuff but always come back to this as the ole&#x27; standby!</li>
            <li> That is outrageous price!  I have used for years and when I finally run out will be looking for a similar product for a reasonable price.  Crazy times if someone is buying this at this price.</li>
            <li> I read quite a few testimonials for this product online from women who have been using it for years when I selected it. I&#x27;ve tried quite a few products myself over the years, but this is the first time I am completely satisfied with the results over the long term. I have aging skin, yet have still been prone to breakouts. However, since using this cleanser over a few months I have no more problems, just a very clean and glowing complexion. In fact, I noticed the difference within a few days. I only wish I had found this years ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years as it works acceptionally well, but can&#x27;t believe the price now!! This is more than it used to cost at my dermatologist office! Ridiculous! Sadly I have to search for a new product.  Can&#x27;t afford it at this price.</li>
            <li> I also used to like this product but not for the price, also felt like it left my skin greasy, like I needed to wash it after I used this.  Instead I&#x27;ve been using DermaDoctor Wrinkle Revenge 3 for about a year; it&#x27;s less than 1/2 the price.  It also has 30% glycolic acid (buffered) like MD Forte.  It&#x27;s not the best at removing all my makeup so I usually use a makeup removing cloth/wipe first or use only in the morning when my face is makeup free.  I put DDWR3 on dry skin and you can really feel it work.  My pores are smaller, clearer, wrinkles are less, and I have less breakouts (I&#x27;m pushing 40, fair, oily skin).  I&#x27;m considering trying Glytone exfoliating gel wash as it is unbuffered glycolic acid at 4.7% (not sure how that equates to 30% buffered...) but kinda afraid to risk $30 and not be pleased.  Keep in mind with glycolics, they help unclog your pores and bring junk to the surface so it can get out.  Therefore you may appear to break out initially as a result but stick with it!  I did not break out so it doesn&#x27;t happen to everyone.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. This purchase though was flat without the usual cleansing feeling I usually get from it. I needed to use three times the amount to get a small cleaning tingle.</li>
