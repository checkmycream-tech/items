            <li>It is VERY strong too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very strong and displeasing.</li>
            <li>I just love Hem incense and this ine is a favorite in our house!</li>

            <li>Never even heard of this kind before, but the red one is awesome, I had to try it.</li>
            <li>The smell wasn&#x27;t all that great, and I had higher expectations for this.</li>
            <li>It has a soapy or clean aroma to it, and I enjoy it greatly.</li>

            <li>Love the smell of it.</li>

            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.  </li>
            <li>It seems to linger better too after the burn.</li>
            <li>MUCH better) scent than the &#x27;Dragon&#x27;s Blood&#x27;</li>

            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I love this incense..</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>My favorite incense scent is Nag Champa.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay...</li>
            <li>TOP QUALITY AS ALWAYS.</li>
            <li>Love the incense great smell and come fast</li>
            <li>120 sticks for under $6 with the free shipping!</li>
            <li>I was satisfied with the seller.</li>
            <li>I love dragon&#x27;s blood, so I thought I would like this.</li>
            <li>I found it interesting that none of the pk&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Great incense but burns fast.</li>
            <li>I love the Dragons Blood scent from HEM.....</li>
            <li>Quality is great, very oily.</li>
            <li>OK for the Hem Line.</li>
            <li>These smell ok</li>
            <li>The seller changed the price during checkout and was asking more for shipping than for the item itself.</li>
            <li>I feel this is much more stronger.</li>
            <li>I love the aroma..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better incense sticks than this that burn slower and are more &amp;#34;rich&amp;#34; in terms of aroma.</li>
            <li>IF you Love Dragons Blood Blu by HEM you will NOT LIKE THIS ONE</li>
            <li>absolutely love this product, I recommend it.</li>
            <li>Love the scent.</li>
            <li>Excellent quality  love blue dragon</li>
            <li>my Oder came on time! : )</li>
            <li>Perfect for spiritually cleansing an area.</li>
            <li>Not as good in my opinion as the original Dragon&#x27;s Blood incense but still fine, a bit musty smelling however.</li>
            <li>Amazing, rich smell.</li>
            <li>Pretty cheap for the quantity, and they smell great.</li>
            <li>The scent was great but my main point was the buring lengths.</li>
            <li>but I prefer the Original Dragons Blood Incense by Hem!</li>
            <li>Smells Great, lasts long, burns nice and evenly.</li>
            <li>Good price for how much you get though.</li>
            <li>I think this would be a good purchase for a store that wants to sell incense.</li>
            <li>Very pleasant smell, and burns for a very long time, and does not leave a smoky scent.</li>
            <li>This incense DOES smell better than the original.</li>
            <li>For outdoor use or in a very large room it might be great but in my apartment it&#x27;s just too much.</li>
            <li>I honestly did not have high expectations for this but about 10-20 seconds after lighting it, it started to smoke better than any of he</li>
            <li>I like the other scent better, but his one is good!</li>
            <li>Bold and aromatic but not too overwhelming.</li>
            <li>The scent is very strong for anyone interested to know</li>
            <li>Smells good for how cheap it was, very aromatic, worth the money.</li>
            <li>I burn it in the kichen/dining room as well as my own bedroom - my son also burns it in his room, and he tends to be very picky about odors.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Guess that&#x27;s why the price is cheap along with free shipping.</li>
            <li>I was about to purchase this item when it offered *free shipping* to top-off my amazon order.</li>
            <li>I usually light on a Friday and a Saturday night.</li>
            <li>Got as described love it would definitely recommend it to anyone thanks for the great product blessed be &#x3D;)  )0</li>
            <li>Worth the price for how many i got.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thin nicely shaped &amp; burns &amp; smells GREAT!</li>
            <li>Nice slow burn, kind of a mild and pleasant soap-like smell</li>
            <li>Easily will fragrance a full 800 sf area.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite scent!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unique.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this incense the first time I bought it because I never smelled it before.</li>
            <li>I was so excited.</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>There was some shipping problem at first, but after that delay, it arrived okay.</li>
            <li>They smell great, but a little more like  nag champa.</li>
            <li>Good incense, smell didn&#x27;t linger as long as I would have liked but nice overall.</li>
            <li>dragon&#x27;s blood blue is a very good scent I really like it a lot</li>
            <li>I love the smell of these incense they are not over powering at all and kind of smell like a male spray to me</li>
            <li>I immediately opened it and it was packaged great with different tubes to keep it fresh longer</li>
            <li>The scent is absolutely horrid, on many occasions it made me light headed and nauseous.</li>
            <li>Not too smokey, burns cleanly.</li>
            <li>I enjoy an occasional cigar and this incense does a good job of neutralizing the scent without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>I had no clear idea how it would smell, and yes it does smell good, but might be a bit strong at times.</li>
            <li>In other words it smells like good, exotic incense, not fruit or coconut or somesuch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quality, fairly priced, smells terrific!</li>
            <li>it smells so light and fresh</li>
            <li>it burns way to fast, it needs more in the box</li>
            <li>So in reality I ended up with only 3 good packs of the 6.</li>
            <li>my house smelled good for several hours after I burned it</li>
            <li>While this Dragon&#x27;s Blood does not smell the same as what I associate the &amp;#34;true Dragon&#x27;s Blood experience&amp;#34; with, it is still quite good.</li>
            <li>granted the smell is pretty strong</li>
            <li>Received quickly.</li>
            <li>This particular one is okay</li>
            <li>Relatively quick burn.</li>
            <li>They give off a nice light cologne smell, similar to Yankee candles midsummer night scent.</li>
            <li>Mine does&#x27;nt have any problems with throwing off sparks, as some other reviewers have said, and they all seem to burn nice and smooth!</li>
            <li>but all in all it smells great and would definitely recommend this to anyone I will definitely purchase this product again for sure.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>The price is good but they don&#x27;t burn long.</li>
            <li>On time, great price &amp; higher quality than I expected...</li>
            <li>It is so flimsy, breaks easy, and burns too fast...not much strength in the scent either...</li>
            <li>The incense doesn&#x27;t really have that strong of an aroma.</li>
            <li>The whole house gets filled with the scent through the vents in the AC.  </li>
            <li>It was still worth it for the deal.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is TRUE to real Dragon&#x27;s Blood!</li>
            <li>well worth it</li>
            <li>Have to say poor quality control or deliberate since each pk had 1/2 perfect sticks with an incense coating each stick as one would expect.</li>
            <li>Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>if you care, you treat my incenses like you care for cool breeze on a hot day.  </li>
            <li>The scent of the incense smells just like the resin, well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell as good as these other reviews say.</li>
            <li>Smells Very Much Like the Original Dragons Blood / Fast Shipping</li>
            <li>They burn quickly and do not smell as nice as other Dragon&#x27;s Blood</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky if I can get a quarter of these to stand straight up.</li>
            <li>Both the Red and Blue Dragon&#x27;s Blood from HEM are mystical blends great for prayer, meditation and relaxation.</li>
            <li>The quality of the incense is good, though for some reason it gives off a black smoke from the charcoal (I assume) when it&#x27;s first lit.</li>
            <li>smells great and relaxes you from a hard day</li>
            <li>You Can buy better incense at Publix or your local flea market.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Exactly the type of incense I was shopping for.  </li>
            <li>ok, but won&#x27;&#x27;t buy same flavor again</li>
            <li>This scent is very relaxing, so whether I&#x27;m using it to help create a calm environment or to help cleanse my living space</li>
            <li>Hem is, in our experience, consistently quality stuff.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more in the future!</li>
            <li>Okay, I read the reviews and expected a sweet aromatic experience, I ordered two day shipping</li>
            <li>I love the scent this is left lingering in my home.</li>
            <li>I have used the Red version for many years.</li>
            <li>Buy the Nag Champa they last a lot longer because they are better quality.</li>
            <li>it was the first time I tried this scent</li>
            <li>I always use Hem as my first choice.</li>
            <li>Better than the red...</li>
            <li>had a 6-pack of these, but after the first stick, I tossed them all.</li>
            <li>Box was a little crushed, but burns and smells GREAT !!</li>
            <li>I had never tried this scent before but it is very smooth, and stays in the air a long time.</li>
            <li>I love the scent, and the sticks last for a reasonable amount of time.  </li>
            <li>but I love Dragons Blood and got this also I personally don&#x27;t like this one as much.</li>
            <li>This is just a minor inconvenience at most.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful, slow burning and the scent lasts quite a long time.  </li>
            <li>I ordered several scents and they all smell fine.</li>
            <li>I burned one, and it was fine while burning, but then I left the house for a bit after it was done.  </li>
            <li>Wish it was a little more powerful</li>
            <li>I was a little worried buying incense online and not being able to smell it prior to buying, but am glad I did.</li>
            <li>I didint really like the smell</li>
            <li>I have an incense holder that holds the sticks straight up.</li>
            <li>This is a MUCH different(and</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like this incense.  </li>
            <li>This company needs a whole bunch of quality control of their finished product.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very overpowering, and frankly, nauseating.</li>
            <li>tossed out the whole package.</li>
            <li>Seller got them to me fast and without issue.</li>
            <li>They got me my order earlier than expected and everything was in good shape (as it should be.)</li>
            <li>It then turns to the familiar white smoke, and the scent, which is the only important thing really, takes over.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you get from many of the other incense</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable, and we were pleasantly surprised when we smelled the incense.  </li>
            <li>If it smells HALF as good as this, I might start ordering only these two scents!</li>
            <li>I would always, always purchase the blue and red dragon&#x27;s blood as it&#x27;s so peaceful and burns really easily.</li>
            <li>We love burning incense because candles turn the container black.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely be ordering more in the future</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this before and its high quality keeps me coming back.&lt;br /&gt;Slow</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, I will be getting it again when I run out.</li>
            <li>High quality scent, high quality deal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a little similar to Nag Champa, but not as &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;rich.&amp;#34; It has a more &amp;#34;antiquated&amp;#34; smell, almost &amp;#34;moldy,&amp;#34; but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>My favorite incense scent is Nag Champa, an old favorite from India that has been around a long time, and is hard to improve on.</li>
            <li>like it a lot, it burns nice and slow and you get a lot in this box.</li>
            <li>Burns nice and slow</li>
            <li>Strong long lasting scent burns about 30mins.</li>
            <li>I ordered this a couple of days ago and it got here early!</li>
            <li>Putting the incense in a hole to hold it up usually causes the incense to bend over, sometimes almost touching the desk that it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li>Fabulous scent and long lasting.</li>
            <li>I typically buy Dragon&#x27;s Blood from Wildberry, but I bought this since they produce another scent of incense that I enjoy.</li>
            <li>I like the smell but think the Red Dragons Blood is a little better smell.</li>
            <li>the only problem is it burns too fast</li>
            <li>It just smells soft and worldly.</li>
            <li>Love the smell along w/ the slow burn.</li>
            <li>I bought this because, according to other reviews, it has a similar scent, is also made in India, and was available at a bargain price.</li>
            <li>It still quite potent and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Not a big fan, there is a burning dung odor to this particular brand that I haven&#x27;t noticed in others.</li>
            <li>I usually slam other reviewers for non-product related reviews, but thought this was important, in case you get excited</li>
            <li>Needless to say I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>scent has something in it that made me give the full box away after half of one stick!</li>
            <li>Great aroma, not overwhelming but continues to last long after burn down.</li>
            <li>Totally 2 different smells I can live with this one.</li>
            <li>Next time i might try the red dragons blood, but I really like this one.</li>
            <li>&amp; I both thought it was a little sweeter scent than the original Dragons Blood (red box)&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will buy again &amp; recommend</li>
            <li>Like, I bought some other stuff off of here and the smoke is very clean, the smoke from these sticks is black.  </li>
            <li>yet I prefer the red dragons blood thus far.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn as long as some others, but that&#x27;s ok, at least it stays lit!</li>
            <li>Long burning and the aroma lingers far after the burn is over.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants a lot of incense for a little bit of money.</li>
            <li>So the person that packed these packages knew and was just getting rid of the bad ones with the good ones.</li>

            <li> It is VERY strong too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strong and displeasing.</li>
            <li> I just love Hem incense and this ine is a favorite in our house!</li>
            <li> This incense is very comforting, and it is very good in rituals involving elementals and dragons, of course.</li>

            <li> Love love love this product!</li>

            <li> Never even heard of this kind before, but the red one is awesome, I had to try it.</li>
            <li> The smell wasn&#x27;t all that great, and I had higher expectations for this.</li>
            <li> It has a soapy or clean aroma to it, and I enjoy it greatly.</li>
            <li> Burns evenly, easy to light, good fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of it.</li>

            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.  </li>
            <li> It seems to linger better too after the burn.</li>
            <li> MUCH better) scent than the &#x27;Dragon&#x27;s Blood&#x27;</li>
            <li> If you get this, you&#x27;ll have more incense</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I love this incense..</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> My favorite incense scent is Nag Champa.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay...</li>
            <li> TOP QUALITY AS ALWAYS.</li>
            <li> Love the incense great smell and come fast</li>
            <li> 120 sticks for under $6 with the free shipping!</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with the seller.</li>
            <li> I love dragon&#x27;s blood, so I thought I would like this.</li>
            <li> I found it interesting that none of the pk&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Great incense but burns fast.</li>
            <li> I love the Dragons Blood scent from HEM.....</li>
            <li> Quality is great, very oily.</li>
            <li> OK for the Hem Line.</li>
            <li> These smell ok</li>
            <li> The seller changed the price during checkout and was asking more for shipping than for the item itself.</li>
            <li> I feel this is much more stronger.</li>
            <li> I love the aroma..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better incense sticks than this that burn slower and are more &amp;#34;rich&amp;#34; in terms of aroma.</li>
            <li> IF you Love Dragons Blood Blu by HEM you will NOT LIKE THIS ONE</li>
            <li> absolutely love this product, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love the scent.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality  love blue dragon</li>
            <li> my Oder came on time! : )</li>
            <li> Perfect for spiritually cleansing an area.</li>
            <li> Not as good in my opinion as the original Dragon&#x27;s Blood incense but still fine, a bit musty smelling however.</li>
            <li> Amazing, rich smell.</li>
            <li> Pretty cheap for the quantity, and they smell great.</li>
            <li> The scent was great but my main point was the buring lengths.</li>
            <li> but I prefer the Original Dragons Blood Incense by Hem!</li>
            <li> Smells Great, lasts long, burns nice and evenly.</li>
            <li> Good price for how much you get though.</li>
            <li> I think this would be a good purchase for a store that wants to sell incense.</li>
            <li> Very pleasant smell, and burns for a very long time, and does not leave a smoky scent.</li>
            <li> This incense DOES smell better than the original.</li>
            <li> For outdoor use or in a very large room it might be great but in my apartment it&#x27;s just too much.</li>
            <li> I honestly did not have high expectations for this but about 10-20 seconds after lighting it, it started to smoke better than any of he</li>
            <li> I like the other scent better, but his one is good!</li>
            <li> Bold and aromatic but not too overwhelming.</li>
            <li> The scent is very strong for anyone interested to know</li>
            <li> Smells good for how cheap it was, very aromatic, worth the money.</li>
            <li> I burn it in the kichen/dining room as well as my own bedroom - my son also burns it in his room, and he tends to be very picky about odors.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Guess that&#x27;s why the price is cheap along with free shipping.</li>
            <li> I was about to purchase this item when it offered *free shipping* to top-off my amazon order.</li>
            <li> I usually light on a Friday and a Saturday night.</li>
            <li> Got as described love it would definitely recommend it to anyone thanks for the great product blessed be &#x3D;)  )0</li>
            <li> Worth the price for how many i got.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin nicely shaped &amp; burns &amp; smells GREAT!</li>
            <li> Nice slow burn, kind of a mild and pleasant soap-like smell</li>
            <li> Easily will fragrance a full 800 sf area.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite scent!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unique.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this incense the first time I bought it because I never smelled it before.</li>
            <li> I was so excited.</li>
            <li> I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> There was some shipping problem at first, but after that delay, it arrived okay.</li>
            <li> They smell great, but a little more like  nag champa.</li>
            <li> Good incense, smell didn&#x27;t linger as long as I would have liked but nice overall.</li>
            <li> dragon&#x27;s blood blue is a very good scent I really like it a lot</li>
            <li> I love the smell of these incense they are not over powering at all and kind of smell like a male spray to me</li>
            <li> I immediately opened it and it was packaged great with different tubes to keep it fresh longer</li>
            <li> The scent is absolutely horrid, on many occasions it made me light headed and nauseous.</li>
            <li> Not too smokey, burns cleanly.</li>
            <li> I enjoy an occasional cigar and this incense does a good job of neutralizing the scent without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> I had no clear idea how it would smell, and yes it does smell good, but might be a bit strong at times.</li>
            <li> In other words it smells like good, exotic incense, not fruit or coconut or somesuch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quality, fairly priced, smells terrific!</li>
            <li> it smells so light and fresh</li>
            <li> it burns way to fast, it needs more in the box</li>
            <li> So in reality I ended up with only 3 good packs of the 6.</li>
            <li> my house smelled good for several hours after I burned it</li>
            <li> While this Dragon&#x27;s Blood does not smell the same as what I associate the &amp;#34;true Dragon&#x27;s Blood experience&amp;#34; with, it is still quite good.</li>
            <li> granted the smell is pretty strong</li>
            <li> Received quickly.</li>
            <li> This particular one is okay</li>
            <li> Relatively quick burn.</li>
            <li> They give off a nice light cologne smell, similar to Yankee candles midsummer night scent.</li>
            <li> Mine does&#x27;nt have any problems with throwing off sparks, as some other reviewers have said, and they all seem to burn nice and smooth!</li>
            <li> but all in all it smells great and would definitely recommend this to anyone I will definitely purchase this product again for sure.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> The price is good but they don&#x27;t burn long.</li>
            <li> On time, great price &amp; higher quality than I expected...</li>
            <li> It is so flimsy, breaks easy, and burns too fast...not much strength in the scent either...</li>
            <li> The incense doesn&#x27;t really have that strong of an aroma.</li>
            <li> The whole house gets filled with the scent through the vents in the AC.  </li>
            <li> It was still worth it for the deal.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is TRUE to real Dragon&#x27;s Blood!</li>
            <li> well worth it</li>
            <li> Have to say poor quality control or deliberate since each pk had 1/2 perfect sticks with an incense coating each stick as one would expect.</li>
            <li> Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> if you care, you treat my incenses like you care for cool breeze on a hot day.  </li>
            <li> The scent of the incense smells just like the resin, well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell as good as these other reviews say.</li>
            <li> Smells Very Much Like the Original Dragons Blood / Fast Shipping</li>
            <li> They burn quickly and do not smell as nice as other Dragon&#x27;s Blood</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lucky if I can get a quarter of these to stand straight up.</li>
            <li> Both the Red and Blue Dragon&#x27;s Blood from HEM are mystical blends great for prayer, meditation and relaxation.</li>
            <li> The quality of the incense is good, though for some reason it gives off a black smoke from the charcoal (I assume) when it&#x27;s first lit.</li>
            <li> smells great and relaxes you from a hard day</li>
            <li> You Can buy better incense at Publix or your local flea market.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Exactly the type of incense I was shopping for.  </li>
            <li> ok, but won&#x27;&#x27;t buy same flavor again</li>
            <li> This scent is very relaxing, so whether I&#x27;m using it to help create a calm environment or to help cleanse my living space</li>
            <li> Hem is, in our experience, consistently quality stuff.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more in the future!</li>
            <li> Okay, I read the reviews and expected a sweet aromatic experience, I ordered two day shipping</li>
            <li> I love the scent this is left lingering in my home.</li>
            <li> I have used the Red version for many years.</li>
            <li> Buy the Nag Champa they last a lot longer because they are better quality.</li>
            <li> it was the first time I tried this scent</li>
            <li> I always use Hem as my first choice.</li>
            <li> Better than the red...</li>
            <li> had a 6-pack of these, but after the first stick, I tossed them all.</li>
            <li> Box was a little crushed, but burns and smells GREAT !!</li>
            <li> I had never tried this scent before but it is very smooth, and stays in the air a long time.</li>
            <li> I love the scent, and the sticks last for a reasonable amount of time.  </li>
            <li> but I love Dragons Blood and got this also I personally don&#x27;t like this one as much.</li>
            <li> This is just a minor inconvenience at most.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful, slow burning and the scent lasts quite a long time.  </li>
            <li> I ordered several scents and they all smell fine.</li>
            <li> I burned one, and it was fine while burning, but then I left the house for a bit after it was done.  </li>
            <li> Wish it was a little more powerful</li>
            <li> I was a little worried buying incense online and not being able to smell it prior to buying, but am glad I did.</li>
            <li> I didint really like the smell</li>
            <li> I have an incense holder that holds the sticks straight up.</li>
            <li> This is a MUCH different(and</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like this incense.  </li>
            <li> This company needs a whole bunch of quality control of their finished product.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very overpowering, and frankly, nauseating.</li>
            <li> tossed out the whole package.</li>
            <li> Seller got them to me fast and without issue.</li>
            <li> They got me my order earlier than expected and everything was in good shape (as it should be.)</li>
            <li> It then turns to the familiar white smoke, and the scent, which is the only important thing really, takes over.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you get from many of the other incense</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable, and we were pleasantly surprised when we smelled the incense.  </li>
            <li> If it smells HALF as good as this, I might start ordering only these two scents!</li>
            <li> I would always, always purchase the blue and red dragon&#x27;s blood as it&#x27;s so peaceful and burns really easily.</li>
            <li> We love burning incense because candles turn the container black.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely be ordering more in the future</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this before and its high quality keeps me coming back.&lt;br /&gt;Slow</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, I will be getting it again when I run out.</li>
            <li> High quality scent, high quality deal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little similar to Nag Champa, but not as &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;rich.&amp;#34; It has a more &amp;#34;antiquated&amp;#34; smell, almost &amp;#34;moldy,&amp;#34; but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> My favorite incense scent is Nag Champa, an old favorite from India that has been around a long time, and is hard to improve on.</li>
            <li> like it a lot, it burns nice and slow and you get a lot in this box.</li>
            <li> Burns nice and slow</li>
            <li> Strong long lasting scent burns about 30mins.</li>
            <li> I ordered this a couple of days ago and it got here early!</li>
            <li> Putting the incense in a hole to hold it up usually causes the incense to bend over, sometimes almost touching the desk that it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> Fabulous scent and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I typically buy Dragon&#x27;s Blood from Wildberry, but I bought this since they produce another scent of incense that I enjoy.</li>
            <li> I like the smell but think the Red Dragons Blood is a little better smell.</li>
            <li> the only problem is it burns too fast</li>
            <li> It just smells soft and worldly.</li>
            <li> Love the smell along w/ the slow burn.</li>
            <li> I bought this because, according to other reviews, it has a similar scent, is also made in India, and was available at a bargain price.</li>
            <li> It still quite potent and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Not a big fan, there is a burning dung odor to this particular brand that I haven&#x27;t noticed in others.</li>
            <li> I usually slam other reviewers for non-product related reviews, but thought this was important, in case you get excited</li>
            <li> Needless to say I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> scent has something in it that made me give the full box away after half of one stick!</li>
            <li> Great aroma, not overwhelming but continues to last long after burn down.</li>
            <li> Totally 2 different smells I can live with this one.</li>
            <li> Next time i might try the red dragons blood, but I really like this one.</li>
            <li> &amp; I both thought it was a little sweeter scent than the original Dragons Blood (red box)&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will buy again &amp; recommend</li>
            <li> Like, I bought some other stuff off of here and the smoke is very clean, the smoke from these sticks is black.  </li>
            <li> yet I prefer the red dragons blood thus far.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn as long as some others, but that&#x27;s ok, at least it stays lit!</li>
            <li> Long burning and the aroma lingers far after the burn is over.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants a lot of incense for a little bit of money.</li>
            <li> So the person that packed these packages knew and was just getting rid of the bad ones with the good ones.</li>
            <li> On other occasions the sticks are too thick to even fit into the hole to hold it upright.</li>
            <li> Burns clean and smells natural not chemical or fake</li>
            <li> A few months after moving to a new city, I&#x27;d run out of all my incense and couldn&#x27;t find a local seller, so I turned to Amazon.</li>
            <li> Not able to describe much about the difference between these two types as yet.  </li>
            <li> They last long and have just the sent  </li>
            <li> 120 count box will last me a very long time!  </li>
            <li> I honestly only bought it because it gave me an option to have next day delivery while I was waiting on my other incense.  </li>
            <li> We prefer the red just slightly over the blue package, but they&#x27;re both of equal quality.</li>
            <li> Karma is not good, wake up man and see the sun for the moon and you will understand that you can never escape your crimes of pretending to be a machine when you are really a person!  </li>
            <li> The other half had incense barely coating the sticks and sections where the incense material looked like it crumbled off sections along the stick.</li>
            <li> The sticks are a little messy, but they do a good job of getting rid of  unpleasant smells.</li>
            <li> The red box smells a little spicier to me, while the blue box is a little stronger with the resin-based scents.</li>
            <li> This item was shipped with a pair of books I also ordered, so arrived a little later than I expected it.</li>
            <li> but some burned a lot quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> Hem ships promptly, and our orders have always arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> This incense is just too strong and unpleasant for my taste.</li>
            <li> A lot of the time the incense is on little more than sliver of wood and trying to stand it is impossible.</li>
            <li> other incense I had purchased.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve had that happen with other insence, but when handling, some powder comes if onto my hands.</li>
            <li> there is a difference in the aroma, hard to define, would like to have had blue</li>
            <li> Fifteen or so minutes on average</li>
            <li> when the people that post negative reviews got their Hem incense, but we&#x27;ve been buying them from Amazon for a while, and from elsewhere prior to finding them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> THESE ARE INEXPENSIVE AND BURN LONGER THAN AVERAGE</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical since the title is dragons blood, but my son really loves dragons and I thought he&#x27;d get a kick out of seeing this incense.  </li>
            <li> It just smells like your burning  little sticks.</li>
            <li> just like your burning  little pieces of wood.</li>
            <li> some of the sticks had little scent stuff on them while others the stick was to fat for the burner</li>
            <li> Half of the wooden sticks are so thin they cannot support the weight of the incense.</li>
            <li> but they burn very dark.  </li>
            <li> Burns a little fast but nothing too crazy.</li>
            <li> I gave it two stars to acknowledge the few that burn as they are supposed to</li>
            <li> it self, missing chunks  along the length of the stick which of course caused it to stop burning.</li>
            <li> I opened had any of the crumbled incense material that was missing from the sticks.</li>
            <li> There were chunks missing on almost every stick.</li>
            <li> I want an incense that lasts and won&#x27;t stop burning because chunks are missing from it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money in this product.</li>
            <li> Wow man I came home from vacation and like the incense look beat up by an angry gorilla.  </li>
            <li> Hard to use as any sort of meditation incense when you are disturbed by the burning smell of animal waste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure where/how/</li>
            <li> The stick length and width is small, they fall out of my incense holder.</li>
            <li> sticks are too thick.</li>
            <li> Each of the six packs have a thick cardboard tube inside to protect from damage.</li>
            <li> This stuff is total crap, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I do detect a subtle difference between the two.</li>
            <li> The odor was not pleasant.</li>
            <li> Some of the sticks are so thin they bend over too much.some</li>
            <li> Scent isn&#x27;t bad, but it doesn&#x27;t permeate rooms as other incenses do.</li>
            <li> it stinks, it stinks it</li>
            <li> stinks</li>
            <li> then you know what to do with, which isnt a bad thing at all.</li>
            <li> I paid for the one day shipping and was about to be disappointed because it said that my package was delayed because of inclement weather.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve never been disappointed, nor have any of our friends that like Hem incense.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this scent is awful.</li>
            <li> Smells horrible and awful quality</li>
            <li> it smells horrible</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the smell of it. It&#x27;s a relaxing smell</li>
            <li> The scent was great but my main point was the buring lengths. Fifteen or so minutes on average but some burned a lot quicker than expected. It was still worth it for the deal.</li>
            <li> Nothing But Burning Wood Smell. You Can buy better incense at Publix or your local flea market. This stuff is total crap, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I had no clear idea how it would smell, and yes it does smell good, but might be a bit strong at times. Good price for how much you get though.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of these incense they are not over powering at all and kind of smell like a male spray to me I like them</li>
            <li> I honestly did not have high expectations for this but about 10-20 seconds after lighting it, it started to smoke better than any of he other incense I had purchased. It also smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Smells great, don&#x27;t burn too fast.</li>
            <li> Fantastic and a lot of them!  Very pleased with this purchase.  Anyone who works magic would love these as a nice addition to there alter table.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this before and its high quality keeps me coming back.&lt;br /&gt;Slow burn, love the scent!!!</li>
            <li> Purchased the red dragon&#x27;s blood thought I would give the blue a try and I have to say not dissapointed at all</li>
            <li> wonderful and at a great price cant beat it</li>
            <li> Good incense, smell didn&#x27;t linger as long as I would have liked but nice overall.</li>
            <li> they smell so good! no problems here</li>
            <li> I love the smell of these</li>
            <li> Great aroma, not overwhelming but continues to last long after burn down. Love how it&#x27;s boxed.. Will try the reds next order to check the difference. HEM is now my go-to incense provider.</li>
            <li> Good Incense by HEM. Burns clean and smells natural not chemical or fake</li>
            <li> I just love Hem incense and this ine is a favorite in our house!</li>
            <li> very awesome scent... love it!</li>
            <li> This incense is just too strong and unpleasant for my taste. For outdoor use or in a very large room it might be great but in my apartment it&#x27;s just too much.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Wish it was a little more powerful but it does the job.</li>
            <li> I ordered this a couple of days ago and it got here early! I lit it up and it smells like heaven!! I highly recommend it, I will be getting it again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I have never burned Dragons Blood but I&#x27;m glad o made this purchase. I honestly only bought it because it gave me an option to have next day delivery while I was waiting on my other incense.  I paid for the one day shipping and was about to be disappointed because it said that my package was delayed because of inclement weather. To my surprise it still showed up! Yey! I immediately opened it and it was packaged great with different tubes to keep it fresh longer and when I lit it, it had a beautiful smell and thickness without being over powering. Needless to say I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> The odor was not pleasant. More of a burnt stable smell.</li>
            <li> Received quickly. Love them.</li>
            <li> I received this in great condition and on time.  It does have a different fragrance to me than the red type.  It is nice yet I prefer the red dragons blood thus far.  Will continue to use and see over time if that changes any.  Not able to describe much about the difference between these two types as yet.  Nicely priced item for the amount received.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because it was a good deal. I ordered several scents and they all smell fine. It&#x27;s a lot of incense sticks for the money but they burn very dark.  Like, I bought some other stuff off of here and the smoke is very clean, the smoke from these sticks is black.  The kind that leaves ash and soot on stuff...  It&#x27;s almost like burning plastic type smoke?  I think this would be a good purchase for a store that wants to sell incense. It&#x27;s packaged for resale.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.  Will be buying again!</li>
            <li> IT came nicely packaged!! A great value for the price! The fragrance is TRUE to real Dragon&#x27;s Blood! It&#x27;s thin nicely shaped &amp; burns &amp; smells GREAT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten the dragon&#x27;s blood and this the blue dragon&#x27;s blood, and while they smell very similar I keep coming back to the blue.  It just smells cleaner if that is possible.  It seems to linger better too after the burn.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite scent!</li>
            <li> Nice relaxing scent...</li>
            <li> well worth it the smell is awesome</li>
            <li> Exactly the type of incense I was shopping for.  Burns evenly, easy to light, good fragrance.</li>
            <li> Smells nice but I prefer the Original Dragons Blood Incense by Hem!</li>
            <li> Not a big fan, there is a burning dung odor to this particular brand that I haven&#x27;t noticed in others. Hard to use as any sort of meditation incense when you are disturbed by the burning smell of animal waste.</li>
            <li> I think i may have been spoiled by the Gonesh brand, this one just didnt do it for me.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Burns a little fast but nothing too crazy.</li>
            <li> ok, but won&#x27;&#x27;t buy same flavor again</li>
            <li> On time, great price &amp; higher quality than I expected...</li>
            <li> This incense is very comforting, and it is very good in rituals involving elementals and dragons, of course. Also for astral travel works good.</li>
            <li> MY niece bought some INcense for Christmas named Dragon&#x27;s Blood and it smelled so nice I ordered these thinking they were the same but were not.</li>
            <li> I didint really like the smell but i started liking it and its great!! Comes with a ton. Gonna try duffrent smells (:</li>
            <li> smell great and arrived quickly</li>
            <li> Smelled great. Not much different from the red box. I love them both!!!!</li>
            <li> I love the scent, and the sticks last for a reasonable amount of time.  My only problem is that the sticks are so varied, with no sense of uniformity. I have an incense holder that holds the sticks straight up. I&#x27;m lucky if I can get a quarter of these to stand straight up. A lot of the time the incense is on little more than sliver of wood and trying to stand it is impossible. Putting the incense in a hole to hold it up usually causes the incense to bend over, sometimes almost touching the desk that it&#x27;s on. On other occasions the sticks are too thick to even fit into the hole to hold it upright. I have to shave a bit off of the edges to get it in.</li>
            <li> This is a MUCH different(and MUCH better) scent than the &#x27;Dragon&#x27;s Blood&#x27; I got from Wally-World(Wal-Mart). Mine does&#x27;nt have any problems with throwing off sparks, as some other reviewers have said, and they all seem to burn nice and smooth! I&#x27;m going to try the &#x27;Dragon&#x27;s Blood&#x27; in the red box, next! If it smells HALF as good as this, I might start ordering only these two scents!</li>
            <li> these are so good I suggest you buy them asap</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not as big of a fan of this fragrance.  I burned one, and it was fine while burning, but then I left the house for a bit after it was done.  When I came back, it smelled like cigarette smoke in my place.  I thought maybe it was a neighbor&#x27;s cigarette smoke, but I put 2 and 2 together every time I burned one of these.  It is VERY strong too.</li>
            <li> This scent is very relaxing, so whether I&#x27;m using it to help create a calm environment or to help cleanse my living space I love my Dragons Blood!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like this incense.  It is so flimsy, breaks easy, and burns too fast...not much strength in the scent either...I will stick to my Gonesh Sticks.</li>
            <li> Not as good in my opinion as the original Dragon&#x27;s Blood incense but still fine, a bit musty smelling however.</li>
            <li> High quality scent, high quality deal. If you get this, you&#x27;ll have more incense then you know what to do with, which isnt a bad thing at all. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a lot of incense for a little bit of money.</li>
            <li> The sticks that I received sometime burn in a flash, some do not have a fragrance, and some just don&#x27;t burn.  However, when I get lucky to find a good one, it is great.  This company needs a whole bunch of quality control of their finished product.  I gave it two stars to acknowledge the few that burn as they are supposed to</li>
            <li> The product is good but I love Dragons Blood and got this also I personally don&#x27;t like this one as much. Still smells alright.</li>
            <li> The wife and I love this stuff! I&#x27;m not sure where/how/when the people that post negative reviews got their Hem incense, but we&#x27;ve been buying them from Amazon for a while, and from elsewhere prior to finding them on Amazon. Hem is, in our experience, consistently quality stuff. We&#x27;ve never been disappointed, nor have any of our friends that like Hem incense. We prefer the red just slightly over the blue package, but they&#x27;re both of equal quality. The scent is great, rich and lingering, yet it&#x27;s not the greasy, cloying sort of smell you get from many of the other incense brands.&lt;br /&gt;  The incense is great. It&#x27;s also well-packaged, protected, sealed in plastic. Hem ships promptly, and our orders have always arrived as expected. My wife and I, and our friends,join in recommending Hem incense, both red and blue boxes, to everyone on Amazon. Quality, fairly priced, smells terrific! Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I used to purchase my HEM incense from a local seller but recently moved and thought I had stocked up. A few months after moving to a new city, I&#x27;d run out of all my incense and couldn&#x27;t find a local seller, so I turned to Amazon. I would always, always purchase the blue and red dragon&#x27;s blood as it&#x27;s so peaceful and burns really easily. I could not pass up this deal for 120 sticks, just amazing. It arrived perfectly packaged and I opened up a box and lit up a stick to fill my room and it immediately put me at ease. I would definitely recommend this scent and the red one as well!</li>
            <li> I love this incense..it smells so light and fresh and it&#x27;s not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> only problem is i ordered BLUE got RED. there is a difference in the aroma, hard to define, would like to have had blue</li>
            <li> Great quality, fast delivery, they smell great defiantly buying more</li>
            <li> Some sticks stay lit others do not.  Half of the wooden sticks are so thin they cannot support the weight of the incense. They smell great but I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> A bit cloying, the undertones are off, but overall it smells okay.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the way this one smelled.</li>
            <li> They last long and have just the sent  I was looking for.</li>
            <li> it stinks, it stinks it stinks and it causes cancer according to google&lt;br /&gt;oh yea, i forgot, it STINKSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS. p u</li>
            <li> They smell great, but a little more like  nag champa. Still awesome though, maybe I&#x27;m just used to the ones I get at Walmart.</li>
            <li> you get a lot of incense.. Some of the sticks are so thin they bend over too much.some sticks are too thick. And you cannot put it in a incense holder. The incense doesn&#x27;t really have that strong of an aroma. this is going to be brutally honest. It just smells like your burning  little sticks. No smell at all. just like your burning  little pieces of wood. That&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> smells great and relaxes you from a hard day</li>
            <li> My favorite incense scent is Nag Champa.  This doesn&#x27;t smell like Nag Champa, but it is in a similar &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; vein.  In other words it smells like good, exotic incense, not fruit or coconut or somesuch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it a lot, it burns nice and slow and you get a lot in this box.</li>
            <li> This stuff&#x27;s pong! It&#x27;s unique. I don&#x27;t care for the scent. Will not reorder this one. Hem is the best brand though. I just have to find my scents.</li>
            <li> Good product. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Pretty cheap for the quantity, and they smell great. The scent is relaxing, great for right before bed. Thank you!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay... Not the best I&#x27;ve ever used I likely won&#x27;t order it again.</li>
            <li> I loved it. It has a beautiful calming smell.</li>
            <li> TOP QUALITY AS ALWAYS. THESE ARE INEXPENSIVE AND BURN LONGER THAN AVERAGE SO THE SCENT LINGERS AROUND W/ THE PERFECT POTENCY</li>
            <li> dragon&#x27;s blood blue is a very good scent I really like it a lot the only problem is it burns too fast but I would purchase it again .</li>
            <li> Love the incense great smell and come fast</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this incense the first time I bought it because I never smelled it before. But after opening it and lighting it, I was an instant fan. It doesn&#x27;t burn as long as some others, but that&#x27;s ok, at least it stays lit! And you can&#x27;t beat the value. 120 sticks for under $6 with the free shipping! Yeah buddy! Sold. I don&#x27;t know how to describe the smell. It just smells soft and worldly. I was satisfied with the seller. They got me my order earlier than expected and everything was in good shape (as it should be.) I will be buying more in the future!</li>
            <li> I like the other scent better, but his one is good!</li>
            <li> These sticks turned out to be smaller than I thought they would be. They burn quickly and do not smell as nice as other Dragon&#x27;s Blood I&#x27;ve used. Maybe because they are &#x27;Dragons Blood Blue&#x27; and not regular &#x27;Dragons Blood&#x27;? The stick length and width is small, they fall out of my incense holder.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product! I am a big incense person. I had never tried this scent before but it is very smooth, and stays in the air a long time. The product burns as it states it does in the description. Next time i might try the red dragons blood, but I really like this one. Fast shipping and I will definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I like both the red box and blue box Dragon&#x27;s Blood incense. I do detect a subtle difference between the two. The red box smells a little spicier to me, while the blue box is a little stronger with the resin-based scents. Try them both side by side and see what you think.</li>
            <li> Never even heard of this kind before, but the red one is awesome, I had to try it. Glad I did!</li>
            <li> I love dragon&#x27;s blood, so I thought I would like this. It&#x27;s very strong and displeasing.</li>
            <li> Okay, I read the reviews and expected a sweet aromatic experience, I ordered two day shipping I was so excited. Dragons blood blue is repulsive. It&#x27;s very overpowering, and frankly, nauseating. It doesn&#x27;t smell as good as these other reviews say.</li>
            <li> I love the scent this is left lingering in my home.</li>
            <li> We burn a lot of incense sticks HEM is 1 of the best brands I&#x27;ve found for an affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;Daughter &amp; I both thought it was a little sweeter scent than the original Dragons Blood (red box)&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will buy again &amp; recommend</li>
            <li> The scent is absolutely horrid, on many occasions it made me light headed and nauseous.</li>
            <li> it burns way to fast, it needs more in the box</li>
            <li> Smells good for how cheap it was, very aromatic, worth the money.</li>
            <li> This item was shipped with a pair of books I also ordered, so arrived a little later than I expected it. However, there was no damage or breakage. The fragrance is pleasing, and sticks are of a generous size. I burn it in the kichen/dining room as well as my own bedroom - my son also burns it in his room, and he tends to be very picky about odors.&lt;br /&gt;I am considering purchasing the Red, in hopes it will have a similarly pleasing fragrance.</li>
            <li> Have purchased before and am extremely happy with service and quality of the product. Will definitely be ordering more in the future</li>
            <li> This is in my opinion a lighter version of the red dragon&#x27;s blood by hem. It&#x27;s a beautiful fragrance for true incense lovers. It still quite potent and a little goes a long way. Easily will fragrance a full 800 sf area.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend recently gifted me this incense and let me tell you its freaking awesome! Has a great burn capacity and it smells great granted the smell is pretty strong so its going suck if you have smell sensibility but all in all it smells great and would definitely recommend this to anyone I will definitely purchase this product again for sure. Super happy with this gift.</li>
            <li> Just about 1/2 of every box in this 6 pk the incense was as rhin as the stick it self, missing chunks  along the length of the stick which of course caused it to stop burning. So in reality I ended up with only 3 good packs of the 6. Have to say poor quality control or deliberate since each pk had 1/2 perfect sticks with an incense coating each stick as one would expect. The other half had incense barely coating the sticks and sections where the incense material looked like it crumbled off sections along the stick. I found it interesting that none of the pk&#x27;s I opened had any of the crumbled incense material that was missing from the sticks. So the person that packed these packages knew and was just getting rid of the bad ones with the good ones. Guess that&#x27;s why the price is cheap along with free shipping. I gave it 3 stars because the smell is very pleasant.</li>
            <li> Great incense but burns fast. So I use body oils to prolong.</li>
            <li> awesome incense, burn forever, smell amazing. I would defiantly buy these again and would recommend these to anyone looking to get the a lot for their money</li>
            <li> I love the Dragons Blood scent from HEM.....I have used the Red version for many years. So I thought &amp;#34;Hey why not&amp;#34; try this. I am not disappointed. This is very very similar to the Red version. Smells quite pleasant and burns well. Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> amazing value...still haven&#x27;t used all of them, bought a while ago</li>
            <li> The sticks are a little messy, but they do a good job of getting rid of  unpleasant smells.</li>
            <li> This particular one is okay thank god because I have a bundle of this ...a great improvement from the dragon blood cones. Totally 2 different smells I can live with this one.</li>
            <li> i needed a stronger scent thank u,do take care</li>
            <li> Smells horrible and awful quality some of the sticks had little scent stuff on them while others the stick was to fat for the burner</li>
            <li> I like the smell but think the Red Dragons Blood is a little better smell. Quality is great, very oily. The packaging is great on this product. Each of the six packs have a thick cardboard tube inside to protect from damage.</li>
            <li> OK for the Hem Line. Smells Very Much Like the Original Dragons Blood / Fast Shipping</li>
            <li> They stink like a pot smoker&#x27;s bedroom. I bought them to mask the smells left in the bathroom but they compete with poop for what&#x27;s the stinkiest.</li>
            <li> The price is good but they don&#x27;t burn long. There were chunks missing on almost every stick. Buy the Nag Champa they last a lot longer because they are better quality. These smell ok but Smell is relative. I want an incense that lasts and won&#x27;t stop burning because chunks are missing from it.</li>
            <li> Very pleasant smell, and burns for a very long time, and does not leave a smoky scent.</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful. Not too smokey, burns cleanly. I enjoy an occasional cigar and this incense does a good job of neutralizing the scent without being overpowering. I would purchase again</li>
            <li> Bought this for Christmas gift to my hubby!  He loves it &amp; makes basement smell so nice.  I only order from Amazon!  Thank you got the great product!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical since the title is dragons blood, but my son really loves dragons and I thought he&#x27;d get a kick out of seeing this incense.  The price is very reasonable, and we were pleasantly surprised when we smelled the incense.  We love burning incense because candles turn the container black.  If you can find a way to deal with the ashes, it&#x27;s a great way to scent your home.  We absolutely love this one!</li>
            <li> I was about to purchase this item when it offered *free shipping* to top-off my amazon order. The seller changed the price during checkout and was asking more for shipping than for the item itself. I removed the item from my cart. This incense DOES smell better than the original. I usually slam other reviewers for non-product related reviews, but thought this was important, in case you get excited and then let-down.</li>
            <li> Excellent and promptly service!!!</li>
            <li> These are great incense. Burn longer and if you looking for an alternative to dragon blood in the red box. I feel this is much more stronger. I usually light on a Friday and a Saturday night. Great price. The aroma is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I love the aroma..it was the first time I tried this scent and I will purchase again.I always use Hem as my first choice.</li>
            <li> very good value and nice scent.</li>
            <li> I think these smell great! I was a little worried buying incense online and not being able to smell it prior to buying, but am glad I did. What a great value and scent!</li>
            <li> smells nothing like dragons blood it smells horrible i literally give them away to any one hew walks threw my door wish i never bought them.</li>
            <li> Box was a little crushed, but burns and smells GREAT !!</li>
            <li> Got as described love it would definitely recommend it to anyone thanks for the great product blessed be &#x3D;)  )0(</li>
            <li> I love the scente, but the quality is not the greatest. They don&#x27;t fall apart in my hands, I&#x27;ve had that happen with other insence, but when handling, some powder comes if onto my hands. This is just a minor inconvenience at most.  Thus stuff is great.</li>
            <li> Great burning capacity and great to enlighten the aroma of a room. Long burning and the aroma lingers far after the burn is over.&lt;br /&gt;This 120 count box will last me a very long time!  Get them at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Scent isn&#x27;t bad, but it doesn&#x27;t permeate rooms as other incenses do. Not wholly regretting this purchase, but will likely try out another product/brand for my next order.</li>
            <li> Excellent aroma !!! Better than the red...</li>
            <li> The seller is great. I got this item delivered in no time. Unfortunately, this scent is awful. It made me feel nauseous.&lt;br /&gt;I tossed out the whole package. Don&#x27;t waste your money in this product.</li>
            <li> Nice slow burn, kind of a mild and pleasant soap-like smell</li>
            <li> Strong long lasting scent burns about 30mins. A great value</li>
            <li> One of my favorites.  Bold and aromatic but not too overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better incense sticks than this that burn slower and are more &amp;#34;rich&amp;#34; in terms of aroma. The smell wasn&#x27;t all that great, and I had higher expectations for this. From my experience and what I&#x27;ve used, this burns to quickly and isn&#x27;t all that of a great smell.</li>
            <li> Fabulous scent and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Excellent smell. Relatively quick burn. Low smoke.</li>
            <li> Big fan of dragons blood. Love the smell along w/ the slow burn.</li>
            <li> good deal if you like dragons blood.</li>
            <li> I loved these, no stinky stick burn and aroma was so rich..my house smelled good for several hours after I burned it</li>
            <li> Great smell! Burns nice and slow so they last a while.</li>
            <li> Smells Great, lasts long, burns nice and evenly.</li>
            <li> good I wish they burn longer</li>
            <li> Wow man I came home from vacation and like the incense look beat up by an angry gorilla.  Like man if you care, you treat my incenses like you care for cool breeze on a hot day.  Karma is not good, wake up man and see the sun for the moon and you will understand that you can never escape your crimes of pretending to be a machine when you are really a person!  I look at myself in the ice and see my breath and I forgive you.  Can you forgive yourself from the shame, man?</li>
            <li> My favorite incense scent is Nag Champa, an old favorite from India that has been around a long time, and is hard to improve on. I bought this because, according to other reviews, it has a similar scent, is also made in India, and was available at a bargain price. There was some shipping problem at first, but after that delay, it arrived okay. The quality of the incense is good, though for some reason it gives off a black smoke from the charcoal (I assume) when it&#x27;s first lit. It then turns to the familiar white smoke, and the scent, which is the only important thing really, takes over.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little similar to Nag Champa, but not as &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;rich.&amp;#34; It has a more &amp;#34;antiquated&amp;#34; smell, almost &amp;#34;moldy,&amp;#34; but not unpleasant. It&#x27;s so difficult to describe scents, and it&#x27;s mostly subjective anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I had a 6-pack of these, but after the first stick, I tossed them all. Others may like this, and it is a bargain, and comes in an attractive box, but it&#x27;s Nag Champa--the champ--for me from now on.</li>
            <li> IF you Love Dragons Blood Blu by HEM you will NOT LIKE THIS ONE it&#x27;s scent has something in it that made me give the full box away after half of one stick! Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> oh,heavenly! To die for!</li>
            <li> absolutely love this product, I recommend it. Product was delivered within the week of purchasing it. The scent of the incense smells just like the resin, well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Smells great!  The whole house gets filled with the scent through the vents in the AC.  Wonderful, slow burning and the scent lasts quite a long time.  Nice product.</li>
            <li> Love the scent. Worth the price for how many i got. The scent is very strong for anyone interested to know</li>
            <li> Excellent quality  love blue dragon&lt;br /&gt;And my Oder came on time! : )</li>
            <li> Both the Red and Blue Dragon&#x27;s Blood from HEM are mystical blends great for prayer, meditation and relaxation. Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> I typically buy Dragon&#x27;s Blood from Wildberry, but I bought this since they produce another scent of incense that I enjoy. While this Dragon&#x27;s Blood does not smell the same as what I associate the &amp;#34;true Dragon&#x27;s Blood experience&amp;#34; with, it is still quite good. It has a soapy or clean aroma to it, and I enjoy it greatly. I would purchase it again, for what it is.</li>
            <li> Alot diffent than reg dragons blood, but smells great</li>
            <li> Amazing, rich smell. Perfect for spiritually cleansing an area. I like both red and blue Dragon&#x27;s Blood from HEM.</li>
            <li> The best smelling HEM incense. They give off a nice light cologne smell, similar to Yankee candles midsummer night scent. Seller got them to me fast and without issue. Will definitely buy again.</li>
