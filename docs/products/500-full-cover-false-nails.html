            <li>they do look nice on and they polish up well.</li>
            <li>Nice price.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so nice and durable.</li>
            <li>These are great nails at a good price when I first opened my package</li>
            <li>They are full cover and fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>i love these nails, the color looks great, painting over them is easy, and they are sturdy nails for every day use.</li>
            <li>This was too good to be true, But I&#x27;m telling you get them while you can!</li>
            <li>but with these nails I found it quite easy to get them done really good</li>
            <li>Okay this is good for $3.50 anything more than</li>
            <li>Good loo to them, but they split really easily.  </li>
            <li>good easy to put on but vomes off after about a day</li>
            <li>Added: delighted to add that the nails that are to big for my fingers were perfect for my toes.</li>
            <li>but they do pop off very easily</li>
            <li>so I can cut it very easily if I wanted shorter nails</li>
            <li>They come off very easy</li>
            <li>and also these seem to be very strong.</li>
            <li>So many nails, so many uses!</li>
            <li>came early and very happy</li>
            <li>I loved the way they fit (no curves, not popping or looking odd).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased these nails to be able to do my own acrylic  nails at home to save money.</li>
            <li>Good quality and came considerably fast!!!</li>
            <li>, I am ordering more , very natural look , as I said , best I have ever seen</li>
            <li>/&gt;About the sized, they is a good variety and works perfectly with wide fingers as mine.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>these nails are better and it fits well on my nails and very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Good product just wished more of the nails fit me better</li>
            <li>then that great product thanks!</li>
            <li>They split on me before i even put the acrylic on,  very cheap material</li>
            <li>The nails came in quickly and good fitting.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more variety on the sizes, and more quantity of the sizes there.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>10/12/12 - I am no longer as satisfied with the nails.</li>
            <li>My result has been poorly fitting nails on each finger.  </li>
            <li>I routinely have to file it to get it close to fitting.</li>
            <li>Couldnt of found a better quality then this</li>
            <li>Our nails popped off cuz it was mostly nails and not acrylic</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>

            <li>but I will be ordering more when I run out.</li>
            <li>and they are adorable looking</li>
            <li>I love these nails.</li>
            <li>cuz I can&#x27;t see before I pay , I had a more than a my share of  dispoiement .</li>
            <li>Customer service was even outstanding .</li>
            <li>and i looked thru all the nails to make sure everything was there</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>Great amount for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>so I won&#x27;t be able to use them all.</li>
            <li>I use these all the time I think they look so cute.</li>
            <li>love them because I get to changed up my color every week.</li>
            <li>they fit wes plentyy !</li>
            <li>I LOVE THESE NAILS.</li>
            <li>They came undamaged and I love the price.</li>
            <li>Would have given better rating</li>
            <li>but it turns out they are more like tips</li>
            <li>they were worth the price &amp; there is a good amount.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>love these.</li>
            <li>but they never stood on my nails for more then a day or two,</li>
            <li>I like these better because they don&#x27;t have the imprint of where your nails are suppose to be</li>
            <li>However, I won&#x27;t be re-ordering as these tips dont have a well and the shape and construction of the tip itself could be better.</li>
            <li>Very cheap and worth spending ur money on!!</li>
            <li>I literally just got these nails, so excited because i LOVE doing my own nails</li>
            <li>I was VERY excited about these nails because of the price and the amount of nails that it comes with.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast and are good nails</li>
            <li>these are pretty good.</li>
            <li>they are pretty good quality</li>
            <li>The quality of the nails is pretty good as well mas the quantity.</li>
            <li>Such a good price and good deal.</li>
            <li>I think they&#x27;d be fine to do a design on and some nail glue for more temporary press-ons.</li>
            <li>The price was perfect and they shipped quicker then expected</li>
            <li>and i was able to find one to fit each nail.</li>
            <li>I used professional nail cutter for acrylic nails and it worked great.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT FLIMSY AND DO NOT LOOK CHEAP.</li>
            <li>I would suggest anyone who wants good quality and inexpensive nails to buy these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered and used multiple sellers/brands of full cover nails and have to say these are the best available.</li>
            <li>Other than that they are perfect</li>
            <li>They are easy to polish and design.</li>
            <li>Painting a spare nail is a an easy, mess-free way to test</li>
            <li>easy to work with not a problem</li>
            <li>Easily breakable.</li>
            <li>They are easy to file and cut.</li>
            <li>I thought these would be an easy way to do my nails</li>
            <li>Easy to trim and shape.</li>
            <li>They work well and are strong.  </li>
            <li>they are full cover tho as it says and they seem to be pretty good</li>
            <li>they are strong</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m very pleased with how fast the shipping came to weeks before the estimated arrival time.</li>
            <li>(ETA - most of this review is now gone, as it was no longer true.</li>
            <li>thanks a lot love pad for a low price and great quality !</li>
            <li>Although the photo shows what most of us call \\&quot;full coverage</li>
            <li>They look fine and appear to be what I want.  </li>
            <li>cheap and the nails break easily</li>
            <li>Loved them had all sizes easily recognized by the marked bag can&#x27;t wait to put them on and use then &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>My sister loves them, this is the second time I have bought her these nails, she loves them , they are easy to work with, and look great</li>
            <li>Although an error occurred originally, this company was very quick to correct it and send the replacement immediately.  </li>
            <li>the sizing was accurate.</li>
            <li>I use this product all the time, liked them so much ordered another 1000, would recommend to all my friends</li>
            <li>I use the nails which don&#x27;t fit for \\&quot;sample\\&quot; nails.</li>
            <li>Such a great deal for the amount of nails you get.</li>
            <li>Cheap</li>
            <li>Ultimately I was happy with the product I received.</li>
            <li>If you can wait a bit for your purchase, considering where they are having to ship from, then I think you will be happy with this company and definitely with the product..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s practically free.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t be cheap or they always fall off.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S NO PROBLEM WHEN TRYING TO FIND YOUR FIT.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered twice 1st time was great second time</li>
            <li>Comes in a big pack at a really great price.</li>
            <li>overall im happy with the purchase</li>
            <li>I had to customise one to fit one finger</li>
            <li>I will admit I was kind of surprised because theses are better quality</li>
            <li>Nails came in ten bags, two for each finger, very organized and perfect for what i needed to do</li>
            <li>and I can paint the nails that are on my right hand better</li>
            <li>Just as described I love my new nails! :)</li>
            <li>but if you trim with nail clippers it makes it quick and easy to file.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great item, exactly as described, nails are an off white color just like most drug store full cover nail.</li>
            <li>I love this product very much.</li>
            <li>The plastic comes in multiple sizes so its easy to find one that fits good</li>
            <li>I love them so much they&#x27;re so easy to cut.</li>
            <li>use is more first aid than cosmetic, so</li>
            <li>Still wish I could find something like those original nails.stand up as well to non-acetone polish.</li>
            <li>Still wish I could find something like those original nails.well to non-acetone polish.</li>
            <li>Love these so much!</li>
            <li>So worth the money!.</li>
            <li>when i got these i was excited...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased these items from Amazon before and received genuine full coverage nails</li>
            <li>Perhaps that&#x27;s significant.</li>
            <li>so there are a great option to have when I want long nails.</li>
            <li>Do crack easily if your trying to crack them other than that great nails.</li>
            <li>If your not one of thouse people that like your nails long it might not be for you lol I had to buy the special nail clippers</li>
            <li>Use them anytime I have a special occasion, or just because.</li>
            <li>And if you get the right glue for them they do not come off!</li>
            <li>They are all organized by size and is super easy to find the right size for your nails .</li>
            <li>They are not as bright white as the photo</li>
            <li>It says full cover, they are tips.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t order this if expecting to be full cover nails to just glue, paint and wear.  </li>
            <li>Only bought it because the price was good.  </li>
            <li>NOT as advertised, tips as opposed to FULL COVER NAILS.</li>
            <li>Unlike some of the reviews I&#x27;ve read mine are full cover nails not just tips.</li>
            <li>They are full nails</li>
            <li>it was really cool</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t get why they r full cover nails.</li>
            <li>received full nails.</li>
            <li>Or perhaps the shouldn&#x27;t be advertised as FULL COVERAGE and a picture of something else.</li>
            <li>These are not tips, these are the type of nails that are full coverage.</li>
            <li>Good luck to you in future sales.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>I received FULL COVER nails</li>
            <li>but it was full cover.</li>
            <li>they were no tips they were full cover nails..</li>
            <li>/&gt;they are full cover</li>
            <li>love how my friends can&#x27;t discover they are not my real nails :</li>
            <li>got the FULL COVERAGE acrylic nails, it lasts like 6 days before it starts cracking, which is acceptable for</li>
            <li>The quality is okay, and they are much cheaper than in a retail store.</li>
            <li>I ordered these in hopes of getting 500 FULL COVER nails.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for FULL cover nails DO NOT BUY THESE.</li>
            <li>FULL NAILS,not nail tips which some people mentioned getting.  </li>
            <li>but it says full cover</li>
            <li>I thought that these were the nail tips - as they are the full nail covers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love these tips and they arrived so fast.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, not bad for what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE</li>
            <li>Not bad at all.</li>
            <li>Super cheap, but well worth the price.</li>
            <li>lol other</li>
            <li>Very good Quality, transparent white, natural look.</li>
            <li>While I would have liked them to be clear or some other natural color so they can be worn without polish, I&#x27;m very happy with the quality of the nails.  </li>
            <li>Came quick considering it was across the world from me.</li>
            <li>I recommend using super glue rather than nail glue.</li>
            <li>Guess I was one of the lucky ones.</li>
            <li>Came quickly, and they are are separated in baggies and labeled for convenient use.</li>
            <li>These are amazing , best quality I have seen , very we&#x27;ll worth the price , takes a while due to shipping from China , took almost a month and a half , but so worth the wait</li>
            <li>Super long so if your into that their good.</li>
            <li>These are exactly what I expected, and are actually really great quality.</li>
            <li>, I would like to say that these nails are awesome, but you would have to use them with this glue to have them last long.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re very durable and they don&#x27;t chip or break easy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m actually quite pleased with these nails!</li>
            <li>I received exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>love them, arrived early too!</li>
            <li>I WILL DEFINITELY BE ORDERING MORE PACKS OF THESE!</li>
            <li>They came about a week and a half early which was awesome !</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great quality for how little you pay.</li>
            <li>they came in little bags with the numbers on then and they are great must buy.</li>
            <li>Length is much longer than ones available in stores.</li>
            <li>The waiting isn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li>clear or paper white lol</li>
            <li>I would much rather pay the near $2 and do my own nails than the $25</li>
            <li>Worth it, and the shipping didn&#x27;t take forever.</li>
            <li>The quality is worth the price.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money</li>
            <li>but for just a couple bucks, it was worth it.</li>
            <li>Perfect for nail art or to do false nails for yourself.</li>
            <li>They break easily, even when colored and coated with high quality nail polish and protective polish.</li>
            <li>I love how strong they are and a long length</li>
            <li>These were awesome other than the fact that whoever bagged them mixed up all of the sizes</li>
            <li>On the other hand, I loved the company, they even sent me a sheet of nail decals that I was not expecting</li>
            <li>I got them right on schedule.</li>
            <li>and they shipped out the right product</li>
            <li>Life-time supply right here</li>
            <li>Can be used as tips aswell if u are using the right products to cover them.</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>I wish manufacturers would use a true picture if their product  - many vendors use a &#x27;universal &amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Just took about 3 weeks, but i still came out winning, comes in a large Ziploc filled with 10 smaller ones, numbered 1-10</li>
            <li>Plus, the largest size nail doesn&#x27;t cover my thumb (but my thumb nails are very large</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed that too many coats of polish or topcoat (or any combination thereof, especially to smooth thick glitters or textured polish) makes the nails noticeaby soft</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed that too many coats of polish or topcoat (or any combination thereof, especially to smooth thick glitters or textured polish) makes the nails noticeaby soft</li>
            <li>Those are amazing but they&#x27;re too long</li>
            <li>When I got them I noticed that they were a bit yellow, which is ok because it makes them seem more natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not creative but they turned out great.</li>
            <li>cant say enough great things about the overall satisfaction and quality of this product.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get what I wanted they were clear and they bend and break to easy</li>
            <li>nice to have, low price fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I used normal nail clippers to trim them (the same I use for my natural nails) and they work great.</li>
            <li>While the price was a good deal, these nails are not full cover, they are tips.</li>
            <li>you very much</li>
            <li>I thought these would be like so many other sets of nails that you have to buy basically &amp;#34;sight unseen&amp;#34; meaning you have no idea the quality or the fit before you buy, but now that I&#x27;ve gotten them and used them I find they are of the highest quality and</li>
            <li>I trim them to fit my nails, then paint them (the polish sticks really well, dries like a normal nail).</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive for the quantity!</li>
            <li>different sizes all organized in individual bags per size, lightweight, overall great!!!</li>
            <li>I had been paying $5 or more at local stores for a pack of 100</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered</li>
            <li>The nails coupled with the glue kept the first set on for weeks.  </li>
            <li>Came pretty fast!</li>
            <li>Perfect for fake nails.</li>
            <li>If anyone knows where I can get nails on a wheel if really appreciate it!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t please with these nails as they are more made for like press on nails, not intended in my opinion for tips or acrylic set as it has no setting point too them and the entire nail is shaped too not shape if you will.</li>
            <li>Most of what I received were either cracked up the middle (from the tip) or had a piece chipped off the corner of the nail well.  </li>
            <li>I use these so much now!</li>
            <li>These are pretty...</li>
            <li>I will most likely order this product again!</li>
            <li>Exactly what you expect is what you are going to get here.</li>
            <li>I finally found website for my nails :) .</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>THESE NAILS COME IN SO MANY DIFFERENT SIZES</li>
            <li>but i got exactly what i wanted.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly as item described.</li>
            <li>They come exactly like they say they will.</li>
            <li>Exact Product Description</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different types of nailglues)</li>
            <li>Pretty hands n feet .</li>
            <li>These nails cut easily when unpainted, and generally cut without cracking if you have to trim after painting.  </li>
            <li>And file with ordinary tools, so easy to glue, on and so easy to paint!</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;ve come in handy for other craft projects as well.</li>
            <li>The nails are fair quality, but I had expected it to be less \\&quot;white\\&quot; and more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; in color.</li>
            <li>I found that generally the glue type doesn&#x27;t matter as long as the bond to the nail is good.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re thick, hard, easy to glue because they&#x27;re so long, easy to file and fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>And By Seeing The Positive Ratings</li>
            <li>It clearly says FULL COVER in the description</li>
            <li>Come with many different sizes only some fit me</li>
            <li>ordered the clear full nails and they came separated in numbered bags.</li>
            <li>The different sizes come in little bags and its super handy!</li>
            <li>They glue and stay on pretty well/long and come in 10 different sizes to fit every finger.</li>
            <li>They are strong and has alot of different sizes.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the quality and will certainly be purchasing them again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Will certainly hesitate before using that retailer again, if at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly easier than keeping up the salon nails.</li>
            <li>and you do get a large amount and variety of nail choices.</li>
            <li>These are the perfect nails to buy if you are a new fake nail user so you can practice.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re strong enough to endure, but also flexible enough to conform to your nail beds (comfortable).</li>
            <li>Plus these look realistic on our hands too!</li>
            <li>they are pretty decent nails.</li>
            <li>It takes a little longer to do them then your own nails</li>
            <li>The nail fits fine at the back cuticle, but has a straight edge on either side.</li>
            <li>The nail fits fine at the back cuticle, but has a straight edge on either side.</li>
            <li>But they are very good false nails for those I can use them on, and I may buy them again!</li>
            <li>I really like the quality of these nails.</li>
            <li>Yes these very inexpensive</li>
            <li>Only relevant parts have been kept.</li>
            <li>I would recommend these if your looking for nail for a once in a while use since they cover your whole nail</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I received the nails lightning fast.  </li>
            <li>very organized with the bags and</li>
            <li>They cover the whole nail</li>
            <li>I have found it much easier if the nails are on the wheel</li>
            <li>I really like these nails</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for all you have done for me.</li>
            <li>I was very worried about receiving tips</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the only reason why I gave it two stars because it was cheap.</li>
            <li>I have yo replace them very often,  </li>
            <li>Shipped fast from China.</li>
            <li>out of all of the nails i got only 3 sizes fit me.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping, and product was what i wanted..</li>
            <li>Thanks....</li>
            <li>you use them like there your real nails.</li>
            <li>I had this set of nails for a whole year now and its not done yet.</li>
            <li>They are also very curved.</li>
            <li>Very affordable price.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear false nails but these are great for practicing nail art designs before trying them out on yourself.</li>
            <li>but they are more of a clear white if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>I could go on and on, they really are a great selection for false nails.</li>
            <li>Ordered the tips but got the full plastic nails took almost the whole 2 months to come in the mail other then that they are not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>Other times I just paint the nails that are bare and let the rest pop off on their own.</li>
            <li>Use this review as your guide, and I&#x27;ve now edited out the earlier information which is no longer true.</li>
            <li>Use this review as your guide, and I&#x27;ve now edited out the earlier information which is no longer true.</li>
            <li>I have been buying full coverage french nails at $6 for a pack of 24</li>
            <li>If you do your nails often, invest in a professional nipper/clipper, followed by a zebra file to shape and an extra fine to finish.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Came 8 days before the expected day and it was full cover nails!</li>
            <li>i work 10 or more hrs a day) just to find out that USPS only holds orders for 15 days and got shipped back to sender</li>
            <li>If you know how to do nails decently people will think you got them done at a solon.</li>
            <li>I love how they were all numbered with 10 different packets, different sizes.</li>
            <li>A few here and there were cracked when I got em, but theres SO many it shouldn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li>I LOVE painting my nails, but having ones that are colored can cut back on the amout of time it takes to do them, especially if I am doing a design.</li>
            <li>Normally I would pay 9.99 for full cover nails, but only get 50.</li>
            <li>So many for such a low price!</li>
            <li>I painted my first pair black and picked the sizes that fit.</li>
            <li>They are pretty accurate to the color of the tip of a nail, however they ended up being a little too white to match my tooth color for the fangs (still a lot better than if I got white).</li>
            <li>The nails are full cover and they cover my nails right down to the cuticles.</li>
            <li>So if that&#x27;s your intended desire,  then they are highly recommended.</li>
            <li>They cut easy with clippers so you can shorten as you please and last pretty long when on.</li>
            <li>My nails are somewhat flat, but these nails are so curved that I&#x27;ve only been able to use up to size 5 for my pinkie even though the smallest they offer is 9.</li>
            <li>so I would not use them with clear polish, but if you are using color polish they hold the color well, do not chip, and look really real.</li>
            <li>Some of the sizes don&#x27;t fit but that was also expected (I&#x27;m using those as color testers).</li>
            <li>I definitely got my money&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;d probably work for a normal thumb).</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m currently looking to see if there is something different I can do to keep them from easily breaking</li>
            <li>The flatter back gives a superior bond while the higher-arched front looks just like any other regular acrylic tip.</li>
            <li>Only downfall is trying to find the right glue that will keep them on.</li>
            <li>i took a size that didnt really fit me and pressed it til it broke or bent too much, it took a little bit of force.</li>
            <li>I do not fill-in or cover with acrylic, so it is a new set when I change my polish weekly.</li>
            <li>I will still order these as I know how to work with them, but if I find something new, I&#x27;ll switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I will still order these as I know how to work with them, but if I find something new, I&#x27;ll switch.</li>
            <li>These nails are incredibly sturdy, they are very long which I understand is how similar products come as well, but the shape is way too off, and they are extremely thick.</li>
            <li>They arrive in a plastic bag filled with ten smaller plastic bags numbered #0 - #9.</li>
            <li>They are good and strong - not easily bent or broken -</li>
            <li>complaints from this old crabby bag!</li>
            <li>The only problem I had was that I received a lot more big sizes than smaller sizes.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I think this will last me a long long time!</li>
            <li>But I had already had a set and ordered a new one way before I ran out of the old one.</li>
            <li>I apply them with superglue, bought in a cheap pack of three or five or whatever, since it doesn&#x27;t last long once it&#x27;s opened.</li>
            <li>Its a pity that product was not usable,initial response from retailer was quick and item mailed rapidly (despite being ordered during the Christmas period).</li>
            <li>i got full cover nails in this package, not tips like other comments said.</li>
            <li>Most of the nails were too big for my fingers, out of the 10 little bags 5 of them will work</li>
            <li>But there are a few sizes that are huge, like for mammoth hands.</li>
            <li>To be clear I did get all sizes 0-9</li>
            <li>First, it takes too long to receive.  </li>
            <li>Use a cotton swab to direct acetone to soften the bond.</li>
            <li>I can only wear the nails for about six days before they are ready to come off.</li>
            <li>I can only wear the nails for about six days before they are ready to come off.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like them because even though it has where your suppose to put the tip at , the nails is still big on the nail and covers almost the whole nail up and after a couple days of doing acrylic with those nails on me and my cousin..</li>
            <li>but when I looked closer I found that the bags are miss marked</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used them, still using my old ones.  </li>
            <li>The nails come in a natural nail color and you have to polish them.</li>
            <li>I bought for my 14 yr old daughter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s basically square, not rounded like a natural nail is around the cuticle area, I had to file them into a rounder shape and this was time consuming.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend these nails for anyone that is looking for a natural look.</li>
            <li>Looks professional.</li>
            <li>my old age I still must take care of my nails and being retired and on a budget</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend the professional acrylic nail clippers if you want to cut them shorter, and cut them before you apply them.</li>
            <li>The only way you can keep these on is if you do absolutely nothing all day.</li>
            <li>and they came early</li>
            <li>they protect you natural nails from chipping or breaking.</li>
            <li>Loved them, this is going to be where I get my fake nails from now on.</li>
            <li>but I had to file them down to make them into full cover nails.</li>
            <li>I suggest using super glue or a heavy duty nail glue in order to keep the bond secure so other than that, grab yourself some nails!</li>
            <li>You can fit the nails in any other plastic container, such as KISS or Nailene.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m rather dissatisfied, as my order states that I chose CLEAR, but I received vibrant white nails.</li>
            <li>quality, came earlier then expected, and I&#x27;m very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much, and I recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I am going to file mine down a little because the fake nail is about 2x as long as the regular nail length i love them, and the nail has a perfect size and shape!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty opaque for me, so I can only use it by coloring the entire fake-nail - unless I want the \\&quot;nail bed\\&quot; to be milky</li>
            <li>Love how it looks on my nail and how its counted from 1 thru 10 in individual small bag to the number of fingers you got....</li>
            <li>cheap don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li>/&gt;They&#x27;re exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Exactly as I expected and fast shipping time considering they came from China!</li>
            <li>Received exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Cannot return as live overseas and already incurred high mailing costs getting to me via family member in USA and refund period expired shortly after it actually reached me.    </li>
            <li>I love that their thicker than I expected not cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li>Dont waste your money, there are so many other competitors out there who will deliver within 1 week.</li>
            <li>I ordered them in \\&quot;natural color\\&quot; but they are so white that you cant use them for half nails only if you put color on the full nail.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what I will do with 500 nails, as I use my hands in such a way that artificial nails will pop off, but this was such a great buy.</li>
            <li>nail is flatter in the back and arches near the front of the nail bed.</li>
            <li>The nails I used to receive until early 2012 had a flatter back which turned into a curve toward the tip.</li>
            <li>But that doesn&#x27;t matter, because I did an 11 year old&#x27;s nails, and they used the smaller sizes!</li>
            <li>Only use if your are a professional.</li>
            <li>I admit I was nervous to buy this at first given the reviews, but it came 2 weeks earlier than I expected</li>
            <li>I paint these, then I glue them on and file them down, and they are good quality, havent ever broken or chipped off at any point.</li>
            <li>Everything was very neatly packaged and labled, the nails themselves are just as advertised, and it all arrived quicker than expected!</li>
            <li>Super cheap for fake nails!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back and ordered a set of clear nails, but it came from a different seller.</li>
            <li>At first they sent me the wrong item nail tips instead if full cover, all I did was let them know</li>
            <li>By far my favorite fake nails.</li>
            <li>CHEAP BUT NOT GOOD QUALITY</li>
            <li>They look totally natural, everyone thinks my nails are that long.</li>
            <li>but it seems if you trim them down a whole bunch they get really fragile and want to split a lot.</li>
            <li>Many artificial nails have a uniformly high arch, making fitting difficult.</li>
            <li>I have in my opinion oddly sized large thumbs and was worried that this set may not have a size big enough</li>
            <li>Put my first set on last night and by noon the next day every single one of them split in half.</li>
            <li>I expected them to be completely clear like the photo</li>
    </ol>

            <li> They&#x27;re so nice and durable.</li>
            <li> These are great nails at a good price when I first opened my package</li>
            <li> They are full cover and fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> i love these nails, the color looks great, painting over them is easy, and they are sturdy nails for every day use.</li>
            <li> This was too good to be true, But I&#x27;m telling you get them while you can!</li>
            <li> but with these nails I found it quite easy to get them done really good</li>
            <li> Okay this is good for $3.50 anything more than</li>
            <li> Good loo to them, but they split really easily.  </li>
            <li> good easy to put on but vomes off after about a day</li>
            <li> Added: delighted to add that the nails that are to big for my fingers were perfect for my toes.</li>
            <li> but they do pop off very easily</li>
            <li> so I can cut it very easily if I wanted shorter nails</li>
            <li> They come off very easy</li>
            <li> and also these seem to be very strong.</li>
            <li> So many nails, so many uses!</li>
            <li> came early and very happy</li>
            <li> I loved the way they fit (no curves, not popping or looking odd).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased these nails to be able to do my own acrylic  nails at home to save money.</li>
            <li> Good quality and came considerably fast!!!</li>
            <li> , I am ordering more , very natural look , as I said , best I have ever seen</li>
            <li> /&gt;About the sized, they is a good variety and works perfectly with wide fingers as mine.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> these nails are better and it fits well on my nails and very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Good product just wished more of the nails fit me better</li>
            <li> then that great product thanks!</li>
            <li> They split on me before i even put the acrylic on,  very cheap material</li>
            <li> The nails came in quickly and good fitting.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more variety on the sizes, and more quantity of the sizes there.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> 10/12/12 - I am no longer as satisfied with the nails.</li>
            <li> My result has been poorly fitting nails on each finger.  </li>
            <li> I routinely have to file it to get it close to fitting.</li>
            <li> Couldnt of found a better quality then this</li>
            <li> Our nails popped off cuz it was mostly nails and not acrylic</li>

            <li> and they are adorable looking</li>
            <li> I love these nails.</li>
            <li> cuz I can&#x27;t see before I pay , I had a more than a my share of  dispoiement .</li>
            <li> Customer service was even outstanding .</li>
            <li> and i looked thru all the nails to make sure everything was there</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> Great amount for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> so I won&#x27;t be able to use them all.</li>
            <li> I use these all the time I think they look so cute.</li>
            <li> love them because I get to changed up my color every week.</li>
            <li> they fit wes plentyy !</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE NAILS.</li>
            <li> They came undamaged and I love the price.</li>
            <li> Would have given better rating</li>
            <li> but it turns out they are more like tips</li>
            <li> they were worth the price &amp; there is a good amount.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> love these.</li>
            <li> but they never stood on my nails for more then a day or two,</li>
            <li> I like these better because they don&#x27;t have the imprint of where your nails are suppose to be</li>
            <li> However, I won&#x27;t be re-ordering as these tips dont have a well and the shape and construction of the tip itself could be better.</li>
            <li> Very cheap and worth spending ur money on!!</li>
            <li> I literally just got these nails, so excited because i LOVE doing my own nails</li>
            <li> I was VERY excited about these nails because of the price and the amount of nails that it comes with.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast and are good nails</li>
            <li> these are pretty good.</li>
            <li> they are pretty good quality</li>
            <li> The quality of the nails is pretty good as well mas the quantity.</li>
            <li> Such a good price and good deal.</li>
            <li> I think they&#x27;d be fine to do a design on and some nail glue for more temporary press-ons.</li>
            <li> The price was perfect and they shipped quicker then expected</li>
            <li> and i was able to find one to fit each nail.</li>
            <li> I used professional nail cutter for acrylic nails and it worked great.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT FLIMSY AND DO NOT LOOK CHEAP.</li>
            <li> I would suggest anyone who wants good quality and inexpensive nails to buy these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered and used multiple sellers/brands of full cover nails and have to say these are the best available.</li>
            <li> Other than that they are perfect</li>
            <li> They are easy to polish and design.</li>
            <li> Painting a spare nail is a an easy, mess-free way to test</li>

            <li> they are strong</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m very pleased with how fast the shipping came to weeks before the estimated arrival time.</li>
            <li> (ETA - most of this review is now gone, as it was no longer true.</li>
            <li> thanks a lot love pad for a low price and great quality !</li>
            <li> Although the photo shows what most of us call \\&quot;full coverage</li>
            <li> They look fine and appear to be what I want.  </li>
            <li> cheap and the nails break easily</li>
            <li> Loved them had all sizes easily recognized by the marked bag can&#x27;t wait to put them on and use then &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> My sister loves them, this is the second time I have bought her these nails, she loves them , they are easy to work with, and look great</li>
            <li> Although an error occurred originally, this company was very quick to correct it and send the replacement immediately.  </li>
            <li> the sizing was accurate.</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time, liked them so much ordered another 1000, would recommend to all my friends</li>
            <li> I use the nails which don&#x27;t fit for \\&quot;sample\\&quot; nails.</li>
            <li> Such a great deal for the amount of nails you get.</li>
            <li> Cheap</li>
            <li> Ultimately I was happy with the product I received.</li>
            <li> If you can wait a bit for your purchase, considering where they are having to ship from, then I think you will be happy with this company and definitely with the product..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s practically free.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be cheap or they always fall off.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S NO PROBLEM WHEN TRYING TO FIND YOUR FIT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered twice 1st time was great second time</li>
            <li> Comes in a big pack at a really great price.</li>
            <li> overall im happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> I had to customise one to fit one finger</li>
            <li> I will admit I was kind of surprised because theses are better quality</li>
            <li> Nails came in ten bags, two for each finger, very organized and perfect for what i needed to do</li>
            <li> and I can paint the nails that are on my right hand better</li>
            <li> Just as described I love my new nails! :)</li>
            <li> but if you trim with nail clippers it makes it quick and easy to file.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great item, exactly as described, nails are an off white color just like most drug store full cover nail.</li>
            <li> I love this product very much.</li>
            <li> The plastic comes in multiple sizes so its easy to find one that fits good</li>
            <li> I love them so much they&#x27;re so easy to cut.</li>
            <li> use is more first aid than cosmetic, so</li>
            <li> Still wish I could find something like those original nails.stand up as well to non-acetone polish.</li>
            <li> Still wish I could find something like those original nails.well to non-acetone polish.</li>
            <li> Love these so much!</li>
            <li> So worth the money!.</li>
            <li> when i got these i was excited...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased these items from Amazon before and received genuine full coverage nails</li>
            <li> Perhaps that&#x27;s significant.</li>
            <li> so there are a great option to have when I want long nails.</li>
            <li> Do crack easily if your trying to crack them other than that great nails.</li>
            <li> If your not one of thouse people that like your nails long it might not be for you lol I had to buy the special nail clippers</li>
            <li> Use them anytime I have a special occasion, or just because.</li>
            <li> And if you get the right glue for them they do not come off!</li>
            <li> They are all organized by size and is super easy to find the right size for your nails .</li>
            <li> They are not as bright white as the photo</li>
            <li> It says full cover, they are tips.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t order this if expecting to be full cover nails to just glue, paint and wear.  </li>
            <li> Only bought it because the price was good.  </li>
            <li> NOT as advertised, tips as opposed to FULL COVER NAILS.</li>
            <li> Unlike some of the reviews I&#x27;ve read mine are full cover nails not just tips.</li>
            <li> They are full nails</li>
            <li> it was really cool</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t get why they r full cover nails.</li>
            <li> received full nails.</li>
            <li> Or perhaps the shouldn&#x27;t be advertised as FULL COVERAGE and a picture of something else.</li>
            <li> These are not tips, these are the type of nails that are full coverage.</li>
            <li> Good luck to you in future sales.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> I received FULL COVER nails</li>
            <li> but it was full cover.</li>
            <li> they were no tips they were full cover nails..</li>
            <li> /&gt;they are full cover</li>
            <li> love how my friends can&#x27;t discover they are not my real nails :</li>
            <li> got the FULL COVERAGE acrylic nails, it lasts like 6 days before it starts cracking, which is acceptable for</li>
            <li> The quality is okay, and they are much cheaper than in a retail store.</li>
            <li> I ordered these in hopes of getting 500 FULL COVER nails.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for FULL cover nails DO NOT BUY THESE.</li>
            <li> FULL NAILS,not nail tips which some people mentioned getting.  </li>
            <li> but it says full cover</li>
            <li> I thought that these were the nail tips - as they are the full nail covers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love these tips and they arrived so fast.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, not bad for what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE</li>
            <li> Not bad at all.</li>
            <li> Super cheap, but well worth the price.</li>
            <li> lol other</li>
            <li> Very good Quality, transparent white, natural look.</li>
            <li> While I would have liked them to be clear or some other natural color so they can be worn without polish, I&#x27;m very happy with the quality of the nails.  </li>
            <li> Came quick considering it was across the world from me.</li>
            <li> I recommend using super glue rather than nail glue.</li>
            <li> Guess I was one of the lucky ones.</li>
            <li> Came quickly, and they are are separated in baggies and labeled for convenient use.</li>
            <li> These are amazing , best quality I have seen , very we&#x27;ll worth the price , takes a while due to shipping from China , took almost a month and a half , but so worth the wait</li>
            <li> Super long so if your into that their good.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I expected, and are actually really great quality.</li>
            <li> , I would like to say that these nails are awesome, but you would have to use them with this glue to have them last long.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re very durable and they don&#x27;t chip or break easy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m actually quite pleased with these nails!</li>
            <li> I received exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> love them, arrived early too!</li>
            <li> I WILL DEFINITELY BE ORDERING MORE PACKS OF THESE!</li>
            <li> They came about a week and a half early which was awesome !</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great quality for how little you pay.</li>
            <li> they came in little bags with the numbers on then and they are great must buy.</li>
            <li> Length is much longer than ones available in stores.</li>
            <li> The waiting isn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li> clear or paper white lol</li>
            <li> I would much rather pay the near $2 and do my own nails than the $25</li>
            <li> Worth it, and the shipping didn&#x27;t take forever.</li>
            <li> The quality is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money</li>
            <li> but for just a couple bucks, it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for nail art or to do false nails for yourself.</li>
            <li> They break easily, even when colored and coated with high quality nail polish and protective polish.</li>
            <li> I love how strong they are and a long length</li>
            <li> These were awesome other than the fact that whoever bagged them mixed up all of the sizes</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I loved the company, they even sent me a sheet of nail decals that I was not expecting</li>
            <li> I got them right on schedule.</li>
            <li> and they shipped out the right product</li>
            <li> Life-time supply right here</li>
            <li> Can be used as tips aswell if u are using the right products to cover them.</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> I wish manufacturers would use a true picture if their product  - many vendors use a &#x27;universal &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Just took about 3 weeks, but i still came out winning, comes in a large Ziploc filled with 10 smaller ones, numbered 1-10</li>
            <li> Plus, the largest size nail doesn&#x27;t cover my thumb (but my thumb nails are very large</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that too many coats of polish or topcoat (or any combination thereof, especially to smooth thick glitters or textured polish) makes the nails noticeaby soft</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that too many coats of polish or topcoat (or any combination thereof, especially to smooth thick glitters or textured polish) makes the nails noticeaby soft</li>
            <li> Those are amazing but they&#x27;re too long</li>
            <li> When I got them I noticed that they were a bit yellow, which is ok because it makes them seem more natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not creative but they turned out great.</li>
            <li> cant say enough great things about the overall satisfaction and quality of this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get what I wanted they were clear and they bend and break to easy</li>
            <li> nice to have, low price fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I used normal nail clippers to trim them (the same I use for my natural nails) and they work great.</li>
            <li> While the price was a good deal, these nails are not full cover, they are tips.</li>
            <li> you very much</li>
            <li> I thought these would be like so many other sets of nails that you have to buy basically &amp;#34;sight unseen&amp;#34; meaning you have no idea the quality or the fit before you buy, but now that I&#x27;ve gotten them and used them I find they are of the highest quality and</li>
            <li> I trim them to fit my nails, then paint them (the polish sticks really well, dries like a normal nail).</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive for the quantity!</li>
            <li> different sizes all organized in individual bags per size, lightweight, overall great!!!</li>
            <li> I had been paying $5 or more at local stores for a pack of 100</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered</li>
            <li> The nails coupled with the glue kept the first set on for weeks.  </li>
            <li> Came pretty fast!</li>
            <li> Perfect for fake nails.</li>
            <li> If anyone knows where I can get nails on a wheel if really appreciate it!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t please with these nails as they are more made for like press on nails, not intended in my opinion for tips or acrylic set as it has no setting point too them and the entire nail is shaped too not shape if you will.</li>
            <li> Most of what I received were either cracked up the middle (from the tip) or had a piece chipped off the corner of the nail well.  </li>
            <li> I use these so much now!</li>
            <li> These are pretty...</li>
            <li> I will most likely order this product again!</li>
            <li> Exactly what you expect is what you are going to get here.</li>
            <li> I finally found website for my nails :) .</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> THESE NAILS COME IN SO MANY DIFFERENT SIZES</li>
            <li> but i got exactly what i wanted.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exactly as item described.</li>
            <li> They come exactly like they say they will.</li>
            <li> Exact Product Description</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different types of nailglues)</li>
            <li> Pretty hands n feet .</li>
            <li> These nails cut easily when unpainted, and generally cut without cracking if you have to trim after painting.  </li>
            <li> And file with ordinary tools, so easy to glue, on and so easy to paint!</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;ve come in handy for other craft projects as well.</li>
            <li> The nails are fair quality, but I had expected it to be less \\&quot;white\\&quot; and more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; in color.</li>
            <li> I found that generally the glue type doesn&#x27;t matter as long as the bond to the nail is good.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re thick, hard, easy to glue because they&#x27;re so long, easy to file and fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> And By Seeing The Positive Ratings</li>
            <li> It clearly says FULL COVER in the description</li>
            <li> Come with many different sizes only some fit me</li>
            <li> ordered the clear full nails and they came separated in numbered bags.</li>
            <li> The different sizes come in little bags and its super handy!</li>
            <li> They glue and stay on pretty well/long and come in 10 different sizes to fit every finger.</li>
            <li> They are strong and has alot of different sizes.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the quality and will certainly be purchasing them again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will certainly hesitate before using that retailer again, if at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly easier than keeping up the salon nails.</li>
            <li> and you do get a large amount and variety of nail choices.</li>
            <li> These are the perfect nails to buy if you are a new fake nail user so you can practice.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re strong enough to endure, but also flexible enough to conform to your nail beds (comfortable).</li>
            <li> Plus these look realistic on our hands too!</li>
            <li> they are pretty decent nails.</li>
            <li> It takes a little longer to do them then your own nails</li>
            <li> The nail fits fine at the back cuticle, but has a straight edge on either side.</li>
            <li> The nail fits fine at the back cuticle, but has a straight edge on either side.</li>
            <li> But they are very good false nails for those I can use them on, and I may buy them again!</li>
            <li> I really like the quality of these nails.</li>
            <li> Yes these very inexpensive</li>
            <li> Only relevant parts have been kept.</li>

            <li> I received the nails lightning fast.  </li>
            <li> very organized with the bags and</li>
            <li> They cover the whole nail</li>
            <li> I have found it much easier if the nails are on the wheel</li>
            <li> I really like these nails</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for all you have done for me.</li>
            <li> I was very worried about receiving tips</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only reason why I gave it two stars because it was cheap.</li>
            <li> I have yo replace them very often,  </li>
            <li> Shipped fast from China.</li>
            <li> out of all of the nails i got only 3 sizes fit me.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping, and product was what i wanted..</li>
            <li> Thanks....</li>
            <li> you use them like there your real nails.</li>
            <li> I had this set of nails for a whole year now and its not done yet.</li>
            <li> They are also very curved.</li>
            <li> Very affordable price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear false nails but these are great for practicing nail art designs before trying them out on yourself.</li>
            <li> but they are more of a clear white if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> I could go on and on, they really are a great selection for false nails.</li>
            <li> Ordered the tips but got the full plastic nails took almost the whole 2 months to come in the mail other then that they are not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> Other times I just paint the nails that are bare and let the rest pop off on their own.</li>
            <li> Use this review as your guide, and I&#x27;ve now edited out the earlier information which is no longer true.</li>
            <li> Use this review as your guide, and I&#x27;ve now edited out the earlier information which is no longer true.</li>
            <li> I have been buying full coverage french nails at $6 for a pack of 24</li>
            <li> If you do your nails often, invest in a professional nipper/clipper, followed by a zebra file to shape and an extra fine to finish.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Came 8 days before the expected day and it was full cover nails!</li>
            <li> i work 10 or more hrs a day) just to find out that USPS only holds orders for 15 days and got shipped back to sender</li>
            <li> If you know how to do nails decently people will think you got them done at a solon.</li>
            <li> I love how they were all numbered with 10 different packets, different sizes.</li>
            <li> A few here and there were cracked when I got em, but theres SO many it shouldn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li> I LOVE painting my nails, but having ones that are colored can cut back on the amout of time it takes to do them, especially if I am doing a design.</li>
            <li> Normally I would pay 9.99 for full cover nails, but only get 50.</li>
            <li> So many for such a low price!</li>
            <li> I painted my first pair black and picked the sizes that fit.</li>
            <li> They are pretty accurate to the color of the tip of a nail, however they ended up being a little too white to match my tooth color for the fangs (still a lot better than if I got white).</li>
            <li> The nails are full cover and they cover my nails right down to the cuticles.</li>
            <li> So if that&#x27;s your intended desire,  then they are highly recommended.</li>
            <li> They cut easy with clippers so you can shorten as you please and last pretty long when on.</li>
            <li> My nails are somewhat flat, but these nails are so curved that I&#x27;ve only been able to use up to size 5 for my pinkie even though the smallest they offer is 9.</li>
            <li> so I would not use them with clear polish, but if you are using color polish they hold the color well, do not chip, and look really real.</li>
            <li> Some of the sizes don&#x27;t fit but that was also expected (I&#x27;m using those as color testers).</li>
            <li> I definitely got my money&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;d probably work for a normal thumb).</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m currently looking to see if there is something different I can do to keep them from easily breaking</li>
            <li> The flatter back gives a superior bond while the higher-arched front looks just like any other regular acrylic tip.</li>
            <li> Only downfall is trying to find the right glue that will keep them on.</li>
            <li> i took a size that didnt really fit me and pressed it til it broke or bent too much, it took a little bit of force.</li>
            <li> I do not fill-in or cover with acrylic, so it is a new set when I change my polish weekly.</li>
            <li> I will still order these as I know how to work with them, but if I find something new, I&#x27;ll switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I will still order these as I know how to work with them, but if I find something new, I&#x27;ll switch.</li>
            <li> These nails are incredibly sturdy, they are very long which I understand is how similar products come as well, but the shape is way too off, and they are extremely thick.</li>
            <li> They arrive in a plastic bag filled with ten smaller plastic bags numbered #0 - #9.</li>
            <li> They are good and strong - not easily bent or broken -</li>
            <li> complaints from this old crabby bag!</li>
            <li> The only problem I had was that I received a lot more big sizes than smaller sizes.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I think this will last me a long long time!</li>
            <li> But I had already had a set and ordered a new one way before I ran out of the old one.</li>
            <li> I apply them with superglue, bought in a cheap pack of three or five or whatever, since it doesn&#x27;t last long once it&#x27;s opened.</li>
            <li> Its a pity that product was not usable,initial response from retailer was quick and item mailed rapidly (despite being ordered during the Christmas period).</li>
            <li> i got full cover nails in this package, not tips like other comments said.</li>
            <li> Most of the nails were too big for my fingers, out of the 10 little bags 5 of them will work</li>
            <li> But there are a few sizes that are huge, like for mammoth hands.</li>
            <li> To be clear I did get all sizes 0-9</li>
            <li> First, it takes too long to receive.  </li>
            <li> Use a cotton swab to direct acetone to soften the bond.</li>
            <li> I can only wear the nails for about six days before they are ready to come off.</li>
            <li> I can only wear the nails for about six days before they are ready to come off.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like them because even though it has where your suppose to put the tip at , the nails is still big on the nail and covers almost the whole nail up and after a couple days of doing acrylic with those nails on me and my cousin..</li>
            <li> but when I looked closer I found that the bags are miss marked</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used them, still using my old ones.  </li>
            <li> The nails come in a natural nail color and you have to polish them.</li>
            <li> I bought for my 14 yr old daughter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically square, not rounded like a natural nail is around the cuticle area, I had to file them into a rounder shape and this was time consuming.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend these nails for anyone that is looking for a natural look.</li>
            <li> Looks professional.</li>
            <li> my old age I still must take care of my nails and being retired and on a budget</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend the professional acrylic nail clippers if you want to cut them shorter, and cut them before you apply them.</li>
            <li> The only way you can keep these on is if you do absolutely nothing all day.</li>
            <li> and they came early</li>
            <li> they protect you natural nails from chipping or breaking.</li>
            <li> Loved them, this is going to be where I get my fake nails from now on.</li>
            <li> but I had to file them down to make them into full cover nails.</li>
            <li> I suggest using super glue or a heavy duty nail glue in order to keep the bond secure so other than that, grab yourself some nails!</li>
            <li> You can fit the nails in any other plastic container, such as KISS or Nailene.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rather dissatisfied, as my order states that I chose CLEAR, but I received vibrant white nails.</li>
            <li> quality, came earlier then expected, and I&#x27;m very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much, and I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I am going to file mine down a little because the fake nail is about 2x as long as the regular nail length i love them, and the nail has a perfect size and shape!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty opaque for me, so I can only use it by coloring the entire fake-nail - unless I want the \\&quot;nail bed\\&quot; to be milky</li>
            <li> Love how it looks on my nail and how its counted from 1 thru 10 in individual small bag to the number of fingers you got....</li>
            <li> cheap don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> /&gt;They&#x27;re exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected and fast shipping time considering they came from China!</li>
            <li> Received exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Cannot return as live overseas and already incurred high mailing costs getting to me via family member in USA and refund period expired shortly after it actually reached me.    </li>
            <li> I love that their thicker than I expected not cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money, there are so many other competitors out there who will deliver within 1 week.</li>
            <li> I ordered them in \\&quot;natural color\\&quot; but they are so white that you cant use them for half nails only if you put color on the full nail.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I will do with 500 nails, as I use my hands in such a way that artificial nails will pop off, but this was such a great buy.</li>
            <li> nail is flatter in the back and arches near the front of the nail bed.</li>
            <li> The nails I used to receive until early 2012 had a flatter back which turned into a curve toward the tip.</li>
            <li> But that doesn&#x27;t matter, because I did an 11 year old&#x27;s nails, and they used the smaller sizes!</li>
            <li> Only use if your are a professional.</li>
            <li> I admit I was nervous to buy this at first given the reviews, but it came 2 weeks earlier than I expected</li>
            <li> I paint these, then I glue them on and file them down, and they are good quality, havent ever broken or chipped off at any point.</li>
            <li> Everything was very neatly packaged and labled, the nails themselves are just as advertised, and it all arrived quicker than expected!</li>
            <li> Super cheap for fake nails!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back and ordered a set of clear nails, but it came from a different seller.</li>
            <li> At first they sent me the wrong item nail tips instead if full cover, all I did was let them know</li>
            <li> By far my favorite fake nails.</li>
            <li> CHEAP BUT NOT GOOD QUALITY</li>
            <li> They look totally natural, everyone thinks my nails are that long.</li>
            <li> but it seems if you trim them down a whole bunch they get really fragile and want to split a lot.</li>
            <li> Many artificial nails have a uniformly high arch, making fitting difficult.</li>
            <li> I have in my opinion oddly sized large thumbs and was worried that this set may not have a size big enough</li>
            <li> Put my first set on last night and by noon the next day every single one of them split in half.</li>
            <li> I expected them to be completely clear like the photo</li>
            <li> These are fantastic for false nails....</li>
            <li> they are long and not very sharp on the ends....</li>
            <li> I worked so hard doing nails for people and the same thing kept happening they broke right in the middle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very rough on my hands especially having an almost 8 month old son</li>
            <li> (too much glue will leak out!), and press hard when I put them on.</li>
            <li> .....holds the color well, will see how long they last.</li>
            <li> only put them on a couple of days ago, took that long to get here.</li>
            <li> I personally like to have long nails</li>
            <li> I left them long ...glued them... polished them ...</li>
            <li> These nails are WHITE, not natural like in the picture.</li>
            <li> The nails are so weak and have the tendency to split right up the middle.  </li>
            <li> but, unlike my previous order, this shipment came directly from China.  </li>
            <li> mine weren&#x27;t yellow, they were off white, kinda translucent looking which I what I expected</li>
            <li> They are really long, but i like long nails</li>
            <li> They are as described however they do come long</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really long</li>
            <li> Not what i expected i thought the nails were going to be packed different not in zip bags ... ...</li>
            <li> The nails are long</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re too long for me.</li>
            <li> they are long, just how I like them.</li>
            <li> They do take long to arrive since they come from China.</li>
            <li> Really really really long.</li>
            <li> there kinda long.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re long but you can fix that with a bit of trimming (:</li>
            <li> have also purchased these nails in black and white, which also had the same delivery date but came way sooner!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re thin but strong without being too heavy</li>
            <li> If someone is used to having very long nails</li>
            <li> and then when they are dry I shape and glue them.</li>
            <li> my nail polish took forever to dry</li>
            <li> So easy to use only down side is that they are squared :/ i usually wear round trips</li>
            <li> All I can say is wow all these nails for such a small cost and the shipping was like a day!</li>
            <li> but they only last a few days before they start splitting down the middle.</li>
            <li> , I was totally surprised it was very thin like real nail after put on</li>
            <li> Then they crack down the middle a day after applied!</li>
            <li> Only down fall for me was painting them..</li>
            <li> The #9 nail (smallest nail, pinky for me) is also quite a bit larger than previous batches of #9s.</li>

            <li> The #9 nail (smallest nail, pinky for me) is also quite a bit larger than previous batches of #9s.</li>
            <li> Next year we will paint these black for witch nails..</li>
            <li> but it only took a week and a half</li>
            <li> The black and white are exaclty what I wanted</li>
            <li> The shipping says it will take a long time, but it only took a few buisness days to get here.</li>
            <li> My natural nails have been buffed down, so there isn&#x27;t much \\&quot;height\\&quot; on the nail bed to bond to the fake nail.</li>
            <li> My natural nails have been buffed down, so there isn&#x27;t much \\&quot;height\\&quot; on the nail bed to bond to the fake nail.</li>
            <li> Although my fingers are more narrow than the fake nails, filling it down a size is no problem.</li>
            <li> they came in little seperate number sized bags in one big bag.</li>
            <li> Use nail clippers or a cutter to carefully clip away the plastic until it begins to loosen.</li>
            <li> I have trouble bonding overall, though it is helped somewhat by CND Seale Bond (a gel glue).</li>
            <li> I have trouble bonding overall, though it is helped somewhat by CND Seale Bond (a gel glue).</li>
            <li> I received all of the baggies #0-9, although Baggie #9 was completely empty...</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> they where just as i wanted and expected.</li>
            <li> have never had a problem keeping these nails on, even when I am rough with them.</li>
            <li> but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> Recieved order before expected delivery time.</li>
            <li> The nails are customizable with careful filing and good-quality altogether.</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t expected to arrive until between feb 10th and feb 27th</li>
            <li> Most fake nails end up so thick that I can&#x27;t scratch with them.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t loose, per se, but the bond has weakened due to water coming in through the gaps around the sides of my fingernail.</li>

            <li> You can always cut them down if they are too long.</li>
            <li> They come long, and you need to cut or file them down.</li>
            <li> They are very long though so you will have to cut them down.</li>
            <li> Hard to file and doesn&#x27;t stay on very long because they fall off doing simple tasks.</li>
            <li> Or I wish we could trade with each other?</li>
            <li> I prefer these over other styles of tips I have used.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who changes their nails alot or does other people&#x27;s nails.</li>
            <li> The biggest size is waaaay to big for me, and the smallest size is waaaay to small for me.</li>
            <li> Each finger size is put into a small bag with a number, than came in a bigger bag and was placed into a bubble wrapped envelope.</li>
            <li> such a small price.  </li>
            <li> My wife lost her nails due to a fungus, and she loves these things.  </li>
            <li> If I was very careful, maybe I could get 8 days of wear, but that&#x27;s pushing it.</li>
            <li> If I was very careful, maybe I could get 8 days of wear, but that&#x27;s pushing it.</li>
            <li> If I was very careful, maybe I could get 10 days of wear, but that&#x27;s pushing it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a girl and so far I&#x27;ve used these nails as vampire fangs and gross fake nails for Halloween.</li>
            <li> cause it&#x27;s hard to do cause I&#x27;m not left handed.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little skeptical of these, but I haven&#x27;t stopped wearing them since I bought them.</li>
            <li> because of my job I have to cut them way down</li>
            <li> When you get them, needs to be filed down.</li>
            <li> The options of designing your nails are endless!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth buying if you are in to nail art or wearing fake nails !</li>
            <li> Again, as I reviewed this nail glue also:[[ASIN:B000KUADF2 IBD 5 Second Brush On Nail Glue for Natural Nails, Artificial Nails &amp; Nail Tips 0.20oz/6g]]</li>
            <li> I never would have ordered them had I known it would take over a month and a half to get to me.</li>
            <li> Horrible nails... should have spent the money for nice ones</li>
            <li> Of dozens of Amazon orders this is the first disappointment 😕</li>
            <li> I wish I had listened to the reviewers who said these were tips and not full cover nails.</li>
            <li> These are not full cover nails.</li>
            <li> this is not full cover nails.</li>
            <li> these are nail tips not full coverage and the title and picture portray.</li>
            <li> I received tips not full nails like the description said.</li>
            <li> They also had these little black pieces of I-Don&#x27;t-</li>
            <li> But the color of the nails is a little odd -</li>
            <li> When it came to cutting the nails it really easy,I used to file after I cut them,I files them down to make the nails look nicer or else for me they looked like what they are chopped up plastic.</li>
            <li> all came packaged in these little baggies neatly and organized.</li>
            <li> So just a little advice.</li>
            <li> will still used them - just a little confusion.</li>
            <li> Other brands would crack when I pressed down to glue (and I wasn&#x27;t pressing hard).</li>
            <li> The others get wasted.</li>
            <li> I was not happy to see several baggies with duplicate numbers</li>
            <li> only problem is that I got alot of broken nails when they arrived.</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re just too thin and don&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t feel heavy on fingers</li>
            <li> I cant seem to leave my nails alone, so I figure if I can&#x27;t get to them, I can&#x27;t destroy them,</li>
            <li> A bit of a waste for me.</li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> I initially got these to make false teeth for a costume</li>
            <li> so when I saw the deal for 500 nails for less than $3 I hopped on the deal!</li>
            <li> these nails are very thin and crack down the middle after 1-2 days of wear</li>
            <li> then I wasn&#x27;t expecting to sign for it (I&#x27;m usually working during day and night..</li>
            <li> Totally crappy and fake.</li>
            <li> The key, for me atleast, was to ligthlty buff my nail,put a small amount of nail glue on the fake nail</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s expensive, whereas buying this quantity yourself is so low cost</li>
            <li> These got here a week before my estimated time of arrival, and came in a small package.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I would call it &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t order from them no more</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t cut them since I like my fake nails long.</li>
            <li> The nails were thin and cracked with slight pressure, they were usable</li>
            <li> I suppose I didn&#x27;t have a hard time getting the nails to stay on.</li>
            <li> at least 5 times maybe</li>
            <li> The little stem that connects it to the wheel is still attached to some of my nails, and some of them have been twisted so hard it creates cracks.</li>
            <li> I received half well tips that are an unfortunate yellowish color.</li>
            <li> my kiss and revlon ones last me 2 weeks these crack on the end after a few days (not on the base where the nail goes)&lt;br</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s useless to me because I have small nail beds.</li>
            <li> Very hard to file and cut for me.</li>
            <li> Very hard and sturdy.</li>
            <li> they dont seem to thin and weak</li>
            <li> I received none that were broken.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all</li>
            <li> I purchased these false nails for one reason, and that was to glue them to popsicle sticks and practice nail art and nail stamping with.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in these changes and will be looking for other nails in the meantime.</li>

            <li> I am disappointed in these changes and will be looking for other nails in the meantime.</li>
            <li> few bad ones in the bunch</li>
            <li> Am very disappointed as its so totally different to product advertised.</li>
            <li> Sending them back very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately none of them match my pinky or index, so they hurt to use them.</li>
            <li> If you use acetone to soak off these nails, they WILL turn into plastic goo that is difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> just some are in the wrong bag.</li>
            <li> nail color issues seem to be a trend when buying fake nails online.</li>
            <li> That was really weird to me</li>
            <li> Useless product to me.</li>
            <li> I would recomend to buy the fake nail clippers.</li>
            <li> Poor quality!  </li>
            <li> The amount of false nails you get and for the price, come on, it&#x27;s a no brainer!</li>
            <li> Very thin.</li>
            <li> the sizes are just off, and they are very very thin</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re meant to be used as extenders under acrylic or gel nails, not as artificial nails on which to apply polish.  </li>
            <li> I am obsessed with these press-on nails!</li>
            <li> I like my nails done but quit the salons because the stuff they put on them is almost impossible to remove.</li>
            <li> Maybe i got a bad batch...</li>
            <li> My bad I didn&#x27;t pay attention when I ordered these.</li>
            <li> Off.i have bad habits of that</li>
            <li> If you have ugly toes like me....</li>
            <li> they bend like crazy!</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> hate the wait</li>
            <li> but i hate acrylics</li>
            <li> The thing I HATED was the shape of the nail at the bottom, the part that goes close to the cuticle.</li>
            <li> They are tips and very disappointed with the purchase.</li>
            <li> so my hands are always getting the worst of it and these have lasted through all of it!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is not what I ordered! It says full cover, they are tips.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive for the quantity! I initially got these to make false teeth for a costume but they&#x27;ve come in handy for other craft projects as well. They come in a compact case that is great for storage until they&#x27;re needed. They&#x27;re not the best quality so I wouldn&#x27;t use them for doing acrylics. I think they&#x27;d be fine to do a design on and some nail glue for more temporary press-ons. I&#x27;m planning on tearing some of them for a split nail tutorial I found which I think would be a great detail to any zombie costume.</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time, liked them so much ordered another 1000, would recommend to all my friends</li>
            <li> I was expecting more variety on the sizes, and more quantity of the sizes there. Unfortunately none of them match my pinky or index, so they hurt to use them. But they are very good false nails for those I can use them on, and I may buy them again! Most fake nails end up so thick that I can&#x27;t scratch with them. Not these ones! I could go on and on, they really are a great selection for false nails.</li>
            <li> I ordered these nails because I like to design nails and paint them. The different sizes come in little bags and its super handy! The price was perfect and they shipped quicker then expected</li>
            <li> To clarify some confusion: these are full-cover nails. Not tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m actually quite pleased with these nails! They&#x27;re strong enough to endure, but also flexible enough to conform to your nail beds (comfortable). I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the quality and will certainly be purchasing them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: these are shipped from China and will take time to be delivered. With that said, mine arrived way before the estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li> different sizes all organized in individual bags per size, lightweight, overall great!!!</li>
            <li> Update your image~ The image shows a white/\\&quot;natural\\&quot; color nail.... the nails i got were yellow-ish tone.     Maybe i got a bad batch...</li>
            <li> Such a good price and good deal. Theres 10 Sizes and i was able to find one to fit each nail. They are really long, but i like long nails so no big deal. You can always cut them down if they are too long. Good product and would recommend</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t order this if expecting to be full cover nails to just glue, paint and wear.  They are tips and very disappointed with the purchase.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great quality for how little you pay. I got them right on schedule.</li>
            <li> Good quality and came considerably fast!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a klutz so I bust nails quite a bit, and this with some nail glue does the job for a fix while it heals.  The plastic comes in multiple sizes so its easy to find one that fits good enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My use is more first aid than cosmetic, so no opinion on that usage, but for the price, its good to have around.</li>
            <li> cheap don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> flimsy. break and crack, would be best with acrylic over them.</li>
            <li> they look great! They are easy to polish and design. They look like the shop. but they do pop off very easily</li>
            <li> I really like the quality of these nails. Wish you could order just the sizes you want. The others get wasted.</li>
            <li> Again, as I reviewed this nail glue also:[[ASIN:B000KUADF2 IBD 5 Second Brush On Nail Glue for Natural Nails, Artificial Nails &amp; Nail Tips 0.20oz/6g]], I would like to say that these nails are awesome, but you would have to use them with this glue to have them last long. That&#x27;s just my opinion. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I received half well tips that are an unfortunate yellowish color. Not what is pictured at all. Of dozens of Amazon orders this is the first disappointment 😕</li>
            <li> I got them way earlier than I thought</li>
            <li> First, it takes too long to receive.  then I wasn&#x27;t expecting to sign for it (I&#x27;m usually working during day and night..i work 10 or more hrs a day) just to find out that USPS only holds orders for 15 days and got shipped back to sender so now I&#x27;m waiting over 6 months for a product that I could have bought in a store around town.  Only bought it because the price was good.  The waiting isn&#x27;t worth it.  Especially when I&#x27;m still waiting for it..</li>
            <li> I wish I had listened to the reviewers who said these were tips and not full cover nails. Maybe at some point the company sent what is actually advertised. Yes these very inexpensive but you still expect to receive what is advertised/described. I have no idea why the company chooses to list these differently than they actually are.</li>
            <li> I ordered the white. I did not see any yellowing. They arrive in a plastic bag filled with ten smaller plastic bags numbered #0 - #9. #0 is the largest, #9 is the smallest. You can fit the nails in any other plastic container, such as KISS or Nailene. They come long, and you need to cut or file them down. If you do your nails often, invest in a professional nipper/clipper, followed by a zebra file to shape and an extra fine to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nail is flatter in the back and arches near the front of the nail bed. Many artificial nails have a uniformly high arch, making fitting difficult. The flatter back gives a superior bond while the higher-arched front looks just like any other regular acrylic tip. I found that generally the glue type doesn&#x27;t matter as long as the bond to the nail is good.  I do not fill-in or cover with acrylic, so it is a new set when I change my polish weekly. I use the nails which don&#x27;t fit for \\&quot;sample\\&quot; nails. Painting a spare nail is a an easy, mess-free way to test colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 5/13/11 - I have a spring-loaded salon cutter. These nails cut easily when unpainted, and generally cut without cracking if you have to trim after painting.  If you use acetone to soak off these nails, they WILL turn into plastic goo that is difficult to remove. Use nail clippers or a cutter to carefully clip away the plastic until it begins to loosen. Use a cotton swab to direct acetone to soften the bond. (ETA - most of this review is now gone, as it was no longer true. Only relevant parts have been kept. 4/2/13)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 10/12/12 - I am no longer as satisfied with the nails. It appears the manufacturer has changed, as the size and shape of some nails has morphed. The nails I used to receive until early 2012 had a flatter back which turned into a curve toward the tip. Now they seem to be arched uniformly. My result has been poorly fitting nails on each finger.  Moisture gets in and weakens the glue bond, leading to wear problems. They do not stand up as well to non-acetone polish. If I was very careful, maybe I could get 8 days of wear, but that&#x27;s pushing it. The #9 nail (smallest nail, pinky for me) is also quite a bit larger than previous batches of #9s. Before, the #9 fit perfectly. I am disappointed in these changes and will be looking for other nails in the meantime. I will still order these as I know how to work with them, but if I find something new, I&#x27;ll switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/2/13: My review now is substantially different than it has been before. Use this review as your guide, and I&#x27;ve now edited out the earlier information which is no longer true. I can only wear the nails for about six days before they are ready to come off. They aren&#x27;t loose, per se, but the bond has weakened due to water coming in through the gaps around the sides of my fingernail. My natural nails have been buffed down, so there isn&#x27;t much \\&quot;height\\&quot; on the nail bed to bond to the fake nail. That isn&#x27;t the fault of the nail; that&#x27;s my own problem. I have trouble bonding overall, though it is helped somewhat by CND Seale Bond (a gel glue). The nail fits fine at the back cuticle, but has a straight edge on either side. That&#x27;s where the gaps are and how water gets in. I&#x27;ve also noticed that too many coats of polish or topcoat (or any combination thereof, especially to smooth thick glitters or textured polish) makes the nails noticeaby soft and I know they will only last for three or four days. Still wish I could find something like those original nails.stand up as well to non-acetone polish. If I was very careful, maybe I could get 8 days of wear, but that&#x27;s pushing it.

The #9 nail (smallest nail, pinky for me) is also quite a bit larger than previous batches of #9s. I routinely have to file it to get it close to fitting. Before, the #9 fit perfectly. I have also received nails with hanging plastic pieces on them or cracks in the tips. Imagine a nail wheel and twisting or breaking the nail off the wheel. The little stem that connects it to the wheel is still attached to some of my nails, and some of them have been twisted so hard it creates cracks. I am disappointed in these changes and will be looking for other nails in the meantime. I will still order these as I know how to work with them, but if I find something new, I&#x27;ll switch.</li>
            <li> Couldnt of found a better quality then this</li>
            <li> Such a great deal for the amount of nails you get. Perfect for nail art or to do false nails for yourself.</li>
            <li> I Feel This Is The Best Thing Im About To Recieve And By Seeing The Positive Ratings They Have They Wont Dissapoint Me And I Thank Them For This Item</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like them because even though it has where your suppose to put the tip at , the nails is still big on the nail and covers almost the whole nail up and after a couple days of doing acrylic with those nails on me and my cousin.. Our nails popped off cuz it was mostly nails and not acrylic</li>
            <li> I paint these, then I glue them on and file them down, and they are good quality, havent ever broken or chipped off at any point. great price. I totally will buy again, and i recommend.</li>
            <li> NOT as advertised, tips as opposed to FULL COVER NAILS. Cannot return as live overseas and already incurred high mailing costs getting to me via family member in USA and refund period expired shortly after it actually reached me.    Its a pity that product was not usable,initial response from retailer was quick and item mailed rapidly (despite being ordered during the Christmas period). Am very disappointed as its so totally different to product advertised. Will certainly hesitate before using that retailer again, if at all.</li>
            <li> Very thin. Only lasted 3 days.</li>
            <li> Love these. Fits me perfect.</li>
            <li> great for what that are</li>
            <li> Came quick considering it was across the world from me. Cheap and they work nicely. I have bought more then once and have recomended to friends. If you know how to do nails decently people will think you got them done at a solon.</li>
            <li> Ordered the tips but got the full plastic nails took almost the whole 2 months to come in the mail other then that they are not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> The nails were thin and cracked with slight pressure, they were usable but I probably will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the best when it comes to doing nails but with these nails I found it quite easy to get them done really good I suppose I didn&#x27;t have a hard time getting the nails to stay on.When it came to cutting the nails it really easy,I used to file after I cut them,I files them down to make the nails look nicer or else for me they looked like what they are chopped up plastic.When I run out I will be buying these again.</li>
            <li> I received exactly what I wanted! I had been paying $5 or more at local stores for a pack of 100 so this is a great deal in my opinion. They are an off white color but that doesn&#x27;t matter to me since I just paint over them anyways. Unlike some of the reviews I&#x27;ve read mine are full cover nails not just tips. They fit my nail shape perfectly!</li>
            <li> I received all of the baggies #0-9, although Baggie #9 was completely empty... Wont be ordering these again!!</li>
            <li> I love these you can turn them into any shape. I would recommend these if your looking for nail for a once in a while use since they cover your whole nail</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered</li>
            <li> They are full nails the sizes are just off, and they are very very thin</li>
            <li> Just as described. Thanks.</li>
            <li> so cheap for its price ! im gonna buy more and more ^^</li>
            <li> Very nice quality nails. They are very long though so you will have to cut them down. I used professional nail cutter for acrylic nails and it worked great. The nails did not crack. They could be a bit sturdier though.</li>
            <li> Great product, great nails, and so many for the price, couldn&#x27;t have got a better deal! Just took about 3 weeks, but i still came out winning, comes in a large Ziploc filled with 10 smaller ones, numbered 1-10</li>
            <li> Definitely get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> I have been buying full coverage french nails at $6 for a pack of 24 so this is a great deal. I paint them before putting them on and then when they are dry I shape and glue them. They look great! They are not as bright white as the photo so I would not use them with clear polish, but if you are using color polish they hold the color well, do not chip, and look really real. I would recommend these!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered and used multiple sellers/brands of full cover nails and have to say these are the best available. They&#x27;re thick, hard, easy to glue because they&#x27;re so long, easy to file and fit perfectly. Other brands would crack when I pressed down to glue (and I wasn&#x27;t pressing hard). These are just perfect and the price is unbeatable. Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Great item, exactly as described, nails are an off white color just like most drug store full cover nail. Length is much longer than ones available in stores. I wish you could buy specific sizes because I only use sizes #0,1,3,4,7. Or I wish we could trade with each other? That would be nice.</li>
            <li> They are as described however they do come long but if you trim with nail clippers it makes it quick and easy to file.&lt;br /&gt;They are flimsy my kiss and revlon ones last me 2 weeks these crack on the end after a few days (not on the base where the nail goes)&lt;br /&gt;Since they come with so many I guess it doesn&#x27;t matter&lt;br /&gt;And mine weren&#x27;t yellow, they were off white, kinda translucent looking which I what I expected&lt;br /&gt;Obviously you don&#x27;t want clear or paper white lol</li>
            <li> I received the nails lightning fast.  Excellent quality.  While I would have liked them to be clear or some other natural color so they can be worn without polish, I&#x27;m very happy with the quality of the nails.  They even included a bonus thing of glue.  The nails coupled with the glue kept the first set on for weeks.  I&#x27;m very very happy with the purchase and will definitely purchase these again!</li>
            <li> These are great nails at a good price when I first opened my package I was not happy to see several baggies with duplicate numbers but when I looked closer I found that the bags are miss marked but I did get all sizes 0-9 just some are in the wrong bag. Nice product.</li>
            <li> These are great tips.  Great price.  They work well and are strong.  I prefer these over other styles of tips I have used.  I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> AWESOME, STIMULATING, AND ENLIGHTENING!</li>
            <li> These are not full cover nails. They are nail tips. They are good and strong - not easily bent or broken - but I had to file them down to make them into full cover nails.</li>
            <li> Love these so much! Use them anytime I have a special occasion, or just because. People actually ask me every time where I got my nails done at.</li>
            <li> These make the perfect Zombie teeth for Halloween to give an effect on a ripped face :) Plus these look realistic on our hands too! Next year we will paint these black for witch nails.. So many nails, so many uses! I love how strong they are and a long length.. Perfect!</li>
            <li> Only four of the sizes are for female sized hands.  Then they crack down the middle a day after applied! Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a lot of nails! They look really nice and though some were damaged, it&#x27;s understandable. Very good deal!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t done the cleanup on my nail design yet but I love this  nail set it&#x27;s really long so I can cut it very easily if I wanted shorter nails .they all came packaged in these little baggies neatly and organized. I love them so much they&#x27;re so easy to cut. And file with ordinary tools, so easy to glue, on and so easy to paint! thanks a lot love pad for a low price and great quality ! Must buy</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t very good. Very hard to file and cut for me. Honestly, thought these were going to be great but they just don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Came pretty fast! Love them!</li>
            <li> have not tried product yet, but they do appear to all be there.&lt;br /&gt;this was a \\&quot;PRIME\\&quot; item, and i was not only charged shipping, i was charged almost twice what it cost, not to mention it took 9 days to get here. that makes me unhappy.&lt;br /&gt;the product looks to be correct and usable, hopefully i have enough time to find out...</li>
            <li> very organized with the bags and the sizing was accurate.</li>
            <li> These were incredible I loved them thank you it was really cool and I am just happy with thank yous so Thank You</li>
            <li> these are what i was looking for. they came in little bags with the numbers on then and they are great must buy.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting  quality push on nails and these are perfect! I have in my opinion oddly sized large thumbs and was worried that this set may not have a size big enough but they did and it fits perfect! Also it said it would take almost a month to get to me but it only took a week and a half so I&#x27;m a very happy customer! :)</li>
            <li> easy to work with not a problem.....holds the color well, will see how long they last. only put them on a couple of days ago, took that long to get here.</li>
            <li> Loved them!!!! Perfect for fake nails. Only downfall is trying to find the right glue that will keep them on.</li>
            <li> My bad I didn&#x27;t pay attention when I ordered these. The don&#x27;t have the bridge to so they can&#x27;t be used as tips. They cover the whole nail</li>
            <li> The nails are fair quality, but I had expected it to be less \\&quot;white\\&quot; and more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; in color. It&#x27;s pretty opaque for me, so I can only use it by coloring the entire fake-nail - unless I want the \\&quot;nail bed\\&quot; to be milky white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not bad for what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back and ordered a set of clear nails, but it came from a different seller. I&#x27;m rather dissatisfied, as my order states that I chose CLEAR, but I received vibrant white nails. I have contacted the seller and I hope to get this issue resolved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality is as decent as the previous order, but buyers should keep in mind: nail color issues seem to be a trend when buying fake nails online.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used them, still using my old ones.  They look fine and appear to be what I want.  Word Word</li>
            <li> they where just as i wanted and expected. great!</li>
            <li> All I can say is wow all these nails for such a small cost and the shipping was like a day! I love that.  Others said these nails were tips but I don&#x27;t get why they r full cover nails. Very pleased and will order again</li>
            <li> Although an error occurred originally, this company was very quick to correct it and send the replacement immediately.  Ultimately I was happy with the product I received. If you can wait a bit for your purchase, considering where they are having to ship from, then I think you will be happy with this company and definitely with the product..</li>
            <li> They came about a week and a half early which was awesome ! They are all organized by size and is super easy to find the right size for your nails . The ones that are too big I&#x27;m going to use to practice nail art ideas ! It&#x27;s definitely worth buying if you are in to nail art or wearing fake nails !</li>
            <li> Work wonderfully, and at a great price!</li>
            <li> Good product just wished more of the nails fit me better</li>
            <li> great nails but i dont think there were 500!</li>
            <li> these nails are better and it fits well on my nails and very easy to apply. I will maybe get these again.</li>
            <li> I got these nails and i love them they are a perfect snug fit to my nails, you can paint them and file them. I am going to file mine down a little because the fake nail is about 2x as long as the regular nail length i love them, and the nail has a perfect size and shape!!!</li>
            <li> At first they sent me the wrong item nail tips instead if full cover, all I did was let them know and they shipped out the right product immediately I got it about a week later. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love how they were all numbered with 10 different packets, different sizes. Although my fingers are more narrow than the fake nails, filling it down a size is no problem. I am so glad that I ordered these! Saved myself a lot of money and they also arrive a week earlier than the existed delivery date. I recommend! :)</li>
            <li> A few here and there were cracked when I got em, but theres SO many it shouldn&#x27;t really matter. Life-time supply right here</li>
            <li> THEY BREAK AND WHEN I WANTED TO CHANGE COLORS I WOULD USE ACETONE AND THEY WERE NOT STONG ENOUGH FOR IT SO THEY WOULD BREAK. I DO NOT RECOMMEND TO BUY. CHEAP BUT NOT GOOD QUALITY</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who changes their nails alot or does other people&#x27;s nails. they&#x27;re very durable and they don&#x27;t chip or break easy. When I run out I&#x27;m buying more.</li>
            <li> received full nails. different sizes from 0 to 9. I love that their thicker than I expected not cheap and flimsy. because of my job I have to cut them way down however that&#x27;s not their fault. I will be ordering this again. hate the wait but what are you gonna do?</li>
            <li> Do these nails come on the wheel?? I have found it much easier if the nails are on the wheel and I can paint the nails that are on my right hand better cause it&#x27;s hard to do cause I&#x27;m not left handed. If anyone knows where I can get nails on a wheel if really appreciate it!💅💜😘</li>
            <li> Totally crappy and fake. Easily breakable. Hard to file and doesn&#x27;t stay on very long because they fall off doing simple tasks.</li>
            <li> I was so happy when I recieved these nails in the mail. I have used these nails before but they came from a different vendor, however I am very happy with these. They were suppose to come in between Nov/7-Nov/28, but I got them Oct/29!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had a problem keeping these nails on, even when I am rough with them. The key, for me atleast, was to ligthlty buff my nail,put a small amount of nail glue on the fake nail (too much glue will leak out!), and press hard when I put them on.Voila! I can keep them on for a good week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also purchased these nails in black and white, which also had the same delivery date but came way sooner! The black and white are exaclty what I wanted and I plan on buying these nails in literally every color that is offered. I LOVE painting my nails, but having ones that are colored can cut back on the amout of time it takes to do them, especially if I am doing a design.</li>
            <li> Not what i expected i thought the nails were going to be packed different not in zip bags ... ...</li>
            <li> this is not full cover nails. but tips.&lt;br /&gt;i had to throw away, since i am not a nail technician.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t please with these nails as they are more made for like press on nails, not intended in my opinion for tips or acrylic set as it has no setting point too them and the entire nail is shaped too not shape if you will.</li>
            <li> Didnt get them at all. I still doont know where they are at. I wanted to use them for my ball and i didnt get to have them with me and i still dont have them. What are you going to do about this.</li>
            <li> I really like these nails only problem is that I got alot of broken nails when they arrived. Over all I think I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> So many sizes. They look great. For the price, it honestly can not be beat. They fall off after like 3 days, but that&#x27;s probably just the glue. Honestly, I think this will last me a long long time! My friends come over, and we do eachothers nails. The biggest size is waaaay to big for me, and the smallest size is waaaay to small for me. But that doesn&#x27;t matter, because I did an 11 year old&#x27;s nails, and they used the smaller sizes! So all in all, this is great. Especially for sharing.</li>
            <li> these are pretty good. Can be used as tips aswell if u are using the right products to cover them.</li>
            <li> Loved them had all sizes easily recognized by the marked bag can&#x27;t wait to put them on and use then &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Really nice i use these to almond nails. :)</li>
            <li> The nails I ordered are the clearish white nails, but what I received are these White-Yellow non transparent nails. They also had these little black pieces of I-Don&#x27;t-Even-Know-What on some of them. That was really weird to me and I probably wont be making more purchases from them anymore.</li>
            <li> I definitely got my money&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> I got tips instead of full cover nails!!!!!!! It clearly says FULL COVER in the description but that&#x27;s not what I got!</li>
            <li> I love the nails. I ordered the nails on March 5 and I got them on April 6. I didn&#x27;t like  the shipping but the nails are a low price because they come from Hong Kong. The nails are long I only cut my thumb nails so I could text. The nails come in a natural nail color and you have to polish them.</li>
            <li> I thought these would be like so many other sets of nails that you have to buy basically &amp;#34;sight unseen&amp;#34; meaning you have no idea the quality or the fit before you buy, but now that I&#x27;ve gotten them and used them I find they are of the highest quality and the sizes are great.</li>
            <li> I was starting to get worried that they weren&#x27;t going to get here before I needed them but I got them within the estimated time. I was also worried that there would be a screw up with the product but everything was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re exactly what I expected. Some of the sizes don&#x27;t fit but that was also expected (I&#x27;m using those as color testers). The nails are full cover and they cover my nails right down to the cuticles. They&#x27;re thin but strong without being too heavy and I expect to have these for a while. The price was a bonus. I will be ordering again when I run out.</li>
            <li> cant say enough great things about the overall satisfaction and quality of this product. I bought for my 14 yr old daughter. very happy and will do business again!</li>
            <li> They come off very easy</li>
            <li> Great quality. Loved them, this is going to be where I get my fake nails from now on.</li>
            <li> i love these nails, the color looks great, painting over them is easy, and they are sturdy nails for every day use.</li>
            <li> While the price was a good deal, these nails are not full cover, they are tips. I ordered them in \\&quot;natural color\\&quot; but they are so white that you cant use them for half nails only if you put color on the full nail. Useless product to me. Would send back if they didn&#x27;t come from east jabip.</li>
            <li> The nails are so weak and have the tendency to split right up the middle.  I wish these could have worked but they&#x27;re just too thin and don&#x27;t last. I worked so hard doing nails for people and the same thing kept happening they broke right in the middle. If someone is used to having very long nails these are great for length. They&#x27;re too long for me. If it weren&#x27;t for them being so flimsy they would be great otherwise.</li>
            <li> Those are amazing but they&#x27;re too long so you have to cut and file after gluing them on.</li>
            <li> I guess I should have read the description these are nail tips not full coverage and the title and picture portray. Or perhaps the shouldn&#x27;t be advertised as FULL COVERAGE and a picture of something else. Sending them back very disappointed. Save your money unless of course you want nail tips -_-</li>
            <li> I was VERY excited about these nails because of the price and the amount of nails that it comes with. When I got them I noticed that they were a bit yellow, which is ok because it makes them seem more natural. The thing I HATED was the shape of the nail at the bottom, the part that goes close to the cuticle. It&#x27;s basically square, not rounded like a natural nail is around the cuticle area, I had to file them into a rounder shape and this was time consuming. I don&#x27;t recommend these nails for anyone that is looking for a natural look. On the other hand, I loved the company, they even sent me a sheet of nail decals that I was not expecting so that was nice. Shipping was faster than I thought. I give the nails 2 stars, but the company I give 5 stars!</li>
            <li> these nails are awesome! they are long, just how I like them. I don&#x27;t cut them since I like my fake nails long. These are the perfect nails to buy if you are a new fake nail user so you can practice. They do take long to arrive since they come from China. These are not tips, these are the type of nails that are full coverage. So you glue these as close as possible to your cuticle.</li>
            <li> love them, arrived early too!</li>
            <li> I love these fake nails. They are easy to file and cut. I already used one of the bags and I plan to purchase more. Fully recommend if you love to do nails like I do.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic for false nails....great product, came in the mail much faster than expected...I will repurchase.</li>
            <li> I personally like to have long nails and these are great, I can get mine to last up to 2 weeks (without them popping off)! I would recomend to buy the fake nail clippers. Great product!</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I expected, and are actually really great quality. I trim them to fit my nails, then paint them (the polish sticks really well, dries like a normal nail). They glue and stay on pretty well/long and come in 10 different sizes to fit every finger. The shipping says it will take a long time, but it only took a few buisness days to get here.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Just awesome.</li>
            <li> Looks professional. Lasted 3-7 days. Order a lot of these things. I was very pleased.</li>
            <li> no!!! they bend like crazy!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for all you have done for me. Good luck to you in future sales.&lt;br /&gt;Have a nice rest of the day&lt;br /&gt;goodbye</li>
            <li> These nails are incredibly sturdy, they are very long which I understand is how similar products come as well, but the shape is way too off, and they are extremely thick. Only use if your are a professional.</li>
            <li> Excellent, I have no complaints to make. Everything was very neatly packaged and labled, the nails themselves are just as advertised, and it all arrived quicker than expected! 10/10, will order again.</li>
            <li> Most of what I received were either cracked up the middle (from the tip) or had a piece chipped off the corner of the nail well.  Poor quality!  I wish manufacturers would use a true picture if their product  - many vendors use a &#x27;universal &amp;#34; photo .</li>
            <li> Okay this is good for $3.50 anything more than that is a no for me. Love how it looks on my nail and how its counted from 1 thru 10 in individual small bag to the number of fingers you got....</li>
            <li> Very good quality. They last week&#x27;s for me on my nails, but im always trying to take them Off.i have bad habits of that(:</li>
            <li> These are fantastic! Not bad at all. few bad ones in the bunch but with so many who cares?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even my old age I still must take care of my nails and being retired and on a budget these work perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints from this old crabby bag!</li>
            <li> perfect fit would order again</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear false nails but these are great for practicing nail art designs before trying them out on yourself. Each finger size is put into a small bag with a number, than came in a bigger bag and was placed into a bubble wrapped envelope. I received none that were broken. Each bag should have 50 pieces each. I would buy more if I were to ever run out.</li>
            <li> Super cheap for fake nails! I would much rather pay the near $2 and do my own nails than the $25 plus it takes for a shop to do em. Worth it, and the shipping didn&#x27;t take forever. 10/10 do recommend</li>
            <li> I received FULL COVER nails I was very worried about receiving tips but it was full cover. It did take some time to get here but atleast I got them. So happy (((:</li>
            <li> I gave it a 5 star because they work nicely. I do love them. It takes a little longer to do them then your own nails but that is to be expected. The quality is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I purchased these false nails for one reason, and that was to glue them to popsicle sticks and practice nail art and nail stamping with. So if that&#x27;s your intended desire,  then they are highly recommended. If you have purchased them for actual wear, I have no idea.</li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t beat this deal. I like my nails done but quit the salons because the stuff they put on them is almost impossible to remove. Also, it&#x27;s expensive, whereas buying this quantity yourself is so low cost it&#x27;s practically free. I apply them with superglue, bought in a cheap pack of three or five or whatever, since it doesn&#x27;t last long once it&#x27;s opened. These nails start popping off after about a week. Sometimes I glue them back on. Other times I just paint the nails that are bare and let the rest pop off on their own. It&#x27;s certainly easier than keeping up the salon nails. I&#x27;d recommend the professional acrylic nail clippers if you want to cut them shorter, and cut them before you apply them. Regular fingernail clippers sometimes crack them.</li>
            <li> There are so many nails and they are greatly organized! So worth the money!. I use these so much now!</li>
            <li> Came 8 days before the expected day and it was full cover nails! They are so long and beautiful, great value for the money!</li>
            <li> Do not like them one bit. Put my first set on last night and by noon the next day every single one of them split in half. The only way you can keep these on is if you do absolutely nothing all day. But I guess you get what you pay for.  That&#x27;s the only reason why I gave it two stars because it was cheap.</li>
            <li> What can I say.....so many sizes to choose from......great quality.....such a small price.  I received my nail tips in great condition and in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> Good loo to them, but they split really easily.  I have yo replace them very often,  they do look nice on and they polish up well.</li>
            <li> These got here a week before my estimated time of arrival, and came in a small package. I opened it and they came in ten sizes. I painted my first pair black and picked the sizes that fit. But you need nail glue!!! AND GET GOOD NAIL GLUE!!! Can&#x27;t be cheap or they always fall off. You can cut them to any size. These are amazing. Had they for two weeks and have two color sets already.</li>
            <li> i got full cover nails in this package, not tips like other comments said. so thats good. and also these seem to be very strong. i took a size that didnt really fit me and pressed it til it broke or bent too much, it took a little bit of force.</li>
            <li> These are pretty... it took awhile to get them... but I will be ordering more when I run out. ...they are long and not very sharp on the ends.... I left them long ...glued them... polished them ...and they are adorable looking</li>
            <li> these nails are great!</li>
            <li> came early and very happy</li>
            <li> ordered these.. the pictures showed they were the nail white tips.. they were no tips they were full cover nails.. not want i needed.. will order from another seller...</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I admit I was nervous to buy this at first given the reviews, but it came 2 weeks earlier than I expected and I&#x27;ve had the nails for two days now and they look great. I used normal nail clippers to trim them (the same I use for my natural nails) and they work great. I will most likely order this product again!</li>
            <li> Exactly what you expect is what you are going to get here.I will admit I was kind of surprised because theses are better quality then one I have bought from nearby stores in kits and such. IF you plan on doing alot of nail buy this. Well worth the money and they are great. Give a while for shipping though.</li>
            <li> easy to use and look great</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t glue these on with extra glue they end up lifting the acrylic and popping off. i&#x27;ve never had my nails pop of in 3 or 4 days, and the color is really yellow and that shows up alot</li>
            <li> This product arrived sooner than anticipated and in good condition. But the color of the nails is a little odd - I&#x27;m not sure I would call it &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> So many nails in great condition!&lt;br /&gt;Good quality, came earlier then expected, and I&#x27;m very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much, and I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waited over a month and they haven&#x27;t came . But it was a great price anyways!!</li>
            <li> i love it its perfect</li>
            <li> I love these nails. I wore them for 5 days and they didn&#x27;t chip at all! I would suggest anyone who wants good quality and inexpensive nails to buy these. Thank you!</li>
            <li> These are amazing , best quality I have seen , very we&#x27;ll worth the price , takes a while due to shipping from China , took almost a month and a half , but so worth the wait , I am ordering more , very natural look , as I said , best I have ever seen</li>
            <li> The amount of false nails you get and for the price, come on, it&#x27;s a no brainer! I love them!</li>
            <li> Just what I was lookin for  and they came early</li>
            <li> Already used these up. Nice price. Shipped fast from China.</li>
            <li> I been buying my nails through website cuz I can&#x27;t see before I pay , I had a more than a my share of  dispoiement . So I didn&#x27;t had a any expectations , thinking I get what I paid for..&lt;br /&gt;Wow , I was totally surprised it was very thin like real nail after put on I can&#x27;t feel heavy on fingers like others did but yet so strong since I use my hands all the time  , this item was perfect for looks and needs . Customer service was even outstanding . I finally found website for my nails :) . Thank you !</li>
            <li> So many! will last me a lifetime. I used them to make some nails for a Halloween outfit, and they worked perfectly. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Good quality. Super long so if your into that their good. I recommend using super glue rather than nail glue. They stay on longer. (;</li>
            <li> Great nails, but last only 1-3 days before it starts to crack.</li>
            <li> I literally just got these nails, so excited because i LOVE doing my own nails but i hate acrylics lol. So i got them opened the package and i looked thru all the nails to make sure everything was there, it was all great until i realized i got 2 #8&#x27;s and NO #7&#x27;s -.- they are full cover tho as it says and they seem to be pretty good they dont seem to thin and weak so thats good. Still havent tried them out but i will most definetly do that today to let you guys know!    Edit: Did my nails and they are great!! So easy to use only down side is that they are squared :/ i usually wear round trips but they look great so whatevs, tried putting a picture but cant seem to do it.</li>
            <li> I thought these would be an easy way to do my nails but they only last a few days before they start splitting down the middle.</li>
            <li> These work well for me. I cant seem to leave my nails alone, so I figure if I can&#x27;t get to them, I can&#x27;t destroy them, right? Oh they don&#x27;t come with glue, so thats extra, I left a review for the glue too. -Eva</li>
            <li> Gotta buy some more these are so perfect!</li>
            <li> Gorgeous nails, great price, so much fun!!!!</li>
            <li> This product was just so great.Just as described I love my new nails! :)</li>
            <li> I love these. But there are a few sizes that are huge, like for mammoth hands.</li>
            <li> Great buy! Items are as advertised! You will not be disappointed. Also great shipping time.</li>
            <li> None of them really fit perfectly on any of my nails.  A bit of a waste for me.</li>
            <li> THESE NAILS COME IN SO MANY DIFFERENT SIZES THAT IT&#x27;S NO PROBLEM WHEN TRYING TO FIND YOUR FIT. OF COURSE THEY ARE NOT THE PERFECT FIT BUT SOME FILING GETS THE JOB DONE. I LOVE THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT FLIMSY AND DO NOT LOOK CHEAP. I WILL DEFINITELY BE ORDERING MORE PACKS OF THESE!</li>
            <li> At first I was a little skeptical of these, but I haven&#x27;t stopped wearing them since I bought them. There are a bunch of different sizes, and all you need to do is trim and file them to the length you want. They are amazing!</li>
            <li> Really really really long.</li>
            <li> when i got these i was excited...untill i tried them....out of all of the nails i got only 3 sizes fit me.  waste of money.</li>
            <li> took ages to come but i got exactly what i wanted.&lt;br /&gt;they are full cover nails.&lt;br /&gt;thank you very much</li>
            <li> Very good Quality, transparent white, natural look. I loved the way they fit (no curves, not popping or looking odd).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d prefer to have them in a container to keep them and not get messed up.&lt;br /&gt;About the sized, they is a good variety and works perfectly with wide fingers as mine.&lt;br /&gt;I love how my friends can&#x27;t discover they are not my real nails :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the FULL COVERAGE acrylic nails, it lasts like 6 days before it starts cracking, which is acceptable for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advice: if there is a size you&#x27;d never use, then use it as a &amp;#34;color tester&amp;#34; before applying the color to your nails.</li>
            <li> My wife lost her nails due to a fungus, and she loves these things.  The quality is okay, and they are much cheaper than in a retail store.</li>
            <li> This nails tend to crack a lot so I&#x27;m currently looking to see if there is something different I can do to keep them from easily breaking</li>
            <li> Great amount for a reasonable price. The options of designing your nails are endless!</li>
            <li> These were awesome other than the fact that whoever bagged them mixed up all of the sizes so I have to spend 10 minutes finding the ones I want. Other than that they are perfect</li>
            <li> I never would have ordered them had I known it would take over a month and a half to get to me. Dont waste your money, there are so many other competitors out there who will deliver within 1 week.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I will do with 500 nails, as I use my hands in such a way that artificial nails will pop off, but this was such a great buy. They are perfect for the prop I will be creating. Love it!</li>
            <li> I ordered these in hopes of getting 500 FULL COVER nails. No, I got 500 NAIL TIPS! Not only that but I got #0-#8 (two bags of number 8, NO NUMBER 9!!!) I&#x27;m so disappointed. If you are looking for FULL cover nails DO NOT BUY THESE.</li>
            <li> Although the photo shows what most of us call \\&quot;full coverage nails\\&quot;, the description says \\&quot;tips\\&quot;, and that&#x27;s what the ones I received are -- tips only.  They&#x27;re meant to be used as extenders under acrylic or gel nails, not as artificial nails on which to apply polish.  I&#x27;ve purchased these items from Amazon before and received genuine full coverage nails but, unlike my previous order, this shipment came directly from China.  Perhaps that&#x27;s significant.</li>
            <li> good easy to put on but vomes off after about a day</li>
            <li> They are full cover and fit perfectly. I am really happy with this purchase. Normally I would pay 9.99 for full cover nails, but only get 50. This was too good to be true, But I&#x27;m telling you get them while you can!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, and product was what i wanted.. FULL NAILS,not nail tips which some people mentioned getting.  They cut easy with clippers so you can shorten as you please and last pretty long when on. Only down fall for me was painting them.. my nail polish took forever to dry lol other then that great product thanks!</li>
            <li> When you get them, needs to be filed down.</li>
            <li> Absolutely perfect!  Super cheap, but well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I received tips not full nails like the description said. Not happy at all</li>
            <li> Most of the nails were too big for my fingers, out of the 10 little bags 5 of them will work so I won&#x27;t be able to use them all.</li>
            <li> Recieved order before expected delivery time. And correct product. Guess I was one of the lucky ones. Ordered mine from timtinng company. So just a little advice. Nails there self are really good. Very hard and sturdy. Do crack easily if your trying to crack them other than that great nails. Even put some crystals on mine and nails held them with no problem.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m very pleased with how fast the shipping came to weeks before the estimated arrival time. I used to pay $6.97 plus tax for a set of 100 nails at my local beauty supply store so when I saw the deal for 500 nails for less than $3 I hopped on the deal! The nails are customizable with careful filing and good-quality altogether. I suggest using super glue or a heavy duty nail glue in order to keep the bond secure so other than that, grab yourself some nails!</li>
            <li> These nails are WHITE, not natural like in the picture. But I use them as my display nails for my nail art designs.</li>
            <li> I love this product very much. I use these all the time I think they look so cute.</li>
            <li> I well be getting these again!! Very cheap and worth spending ur money on!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered twice 1st time was great second time I didn&#x27;t get what I wanted they were clear and they bend and break to easy I won&#x27;t order from them no more</li>
            <li> love them because I get to changed up my color every week.</li>
            <li> So happy with these! Exactly as item described. Will be ordering more soon!</li>
            <li> Horrible nails... should have spent the money for nice ones</li>
            <li> These nails are the perfect quality. They are strong and has alot of different sizes. These nails even fit my toe nails!!</li>
            <li> great price for all the nails you get. they are pretty decent nails. but it seems if you trim them down a whole bunch they get really fragile and want to split a lot. but for just a couple bucks, it was worth it.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with these press-on nails! I am allergic to acrylic so there are a great option to have when I want long nails.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast and are good nails Thanks....</li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected and fast shipping time considering they came from China!</li>
            <li> The nails came in quickly and good fitting. they came in little seperate number sized bags in one big bag. they fit wes plentyy !ll and there</li>
            <li> Came quickly, and they are are separated in baggies and labeled for convenient use. Very happy with this purchase. Would recommend to anybody who enjoys doing nail art!</li>
            <li> Took awhile to get here but it is a good buy. If your not one of thouse people that like your nails long it might not be for you lol I had to buy the special nail clippers cause there kinda long. Come with many different sizes only some fit me but I don&#x27;t care came with a lot at a good price.! c:</li>
            <li> I loved them! They are amazing and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it! I&#x27;m very rough on my hands especially having an almost 8 month old son so my hands are always getting the worst of it and these have lasted through all of it! Never cracked or broke! And if you get the right glue for them they do not come off! Lol they are amazing!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE NAILS. They&#x27;re so nice and durable. They came undamaged and I love the price.</li>
            <li> Would have given better rating but it says full cover and that&#x27;s why I bought them but it turns out they are more like tips</li>
            <li> i like the nails, i did em at least 5 times maybe.... they were worth the price &amp; there is a good amount.</li>
            <li> I love these nails! Comes in a big pack at a really great price. You can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> I love them. They come exactly like they say they will. They look totally natural, everyone thinks my nails are that long. I love it! They took longer than a month I believe to come. But I had already had a set and ordered a new one way before I ran out of the old one. They way I would never be without them. By far my favorite fake nails.</li>
            <li> I would buy from again. nice to have, low price fast shipping. love these. they protect you natural nails from chipping or breaking. you use them like there your real nails. they are strong</li>
            <li> they are pretty good quality and you do get a large amount and variety of nail choices. overall im happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> Very very good quality nails.  The only problem I had was that I received a lot more big sizes than smaller sizes.  To be clear I did get all sizes 0-9 but there were a ton of size 0&#x27;s in the bag and that&#x27;s useless to me because I have small nail beds.</li>
            <li> Nails came in ten bags, two for each finger, very organized and perfect for what i needed to do</li>
            <li> I thought that these were the nail tips - as they are the full nail covers.&lt;br /&gt;I will still used them - just a little confusion.</li>
            <li> Product is as described, I&#x27;ve used them once. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> cheap and the nails break easily</li>
            <li> They break easily, even when colored and coated with high quality nail polish and protective polish.</li>
            <li> My sister loves them, this is the second time I have bought her these nails, she loves them , they are easy to work with, and look great</li>
            <li> Exact Product Description</li>
            <li> Received exactly what I expected. And loved them. Great for customizing your nails at home.</li>
            <li> So many for such a low price! I had this set of nails for a whole year now and its not done yet. The quality of the nails is pretty good as well mas the quantity. I purchased these nails to be able to do my own acrylic  nails at home to save money.</li>
            <li> Very good for the price . They&#x27;re long but you can fix that with a bit of trimming (:</li>
            <li> Love these tips and they arrived so fast.  Thank you thank you thank you... I&#x27;m doing some nail art this weekend for sure !</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was these nails or the glue I use (even tho I&#x27;ve tried many different types of nailglues) but they never stood on my nails for more then a day or two,</li>
            <li> you get what you pay for. these nails are very thin and crack down the middle after 1-2 days of wear</li>
            <li> I like these better because they don&#x27;t have the imprint of where your nails are suppose to be</li>
            <li> Great price and seem to be good</li>
            <li> I WILL ALWAYS BUY THESE (:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a girl and so far I&#x27;ve used these nails as vampire fangs and gross fake nails for Halloween. They are pretty accurate to the color of the tip of a nail, however they ended up being a little too white to match my tooth color for the fangs (still a lot better than if I got white). They are also very curved. My nails are somewhat flat, but these nails are so curved that I&#x27;ve only been able to use up to size 5 for my pinkie even though the smallest they offer is 9. Plus, the largest size nail doesn&#x27;t cover my thumb (but my thumb nails are very large so it&#x27;d probably work for a normal thumb).</li>
            <li> They split on me before i even put the acrylic on,  very cheap material</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this purchase. Very affordable price. I received my order today Jan 31 and it wasn&#x27;t expected to arrive until between feb 10th and feb 27th so great shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the clear full nails and they came separated in numbered bags. I expected them to be completely clear like the photo but they are more of a clear white if that makes sense. Not a big deal for me as I ordered them to paint rather than getting acrylics done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend ordering these!</li>
            <li> These tips did the job at the time. However, I won&#x27;t be re-ordering as these tips dont have a well and the shape and construction of the tip itself could be better.</li>
            <li> These worked well. Easy to trim and shape. I had to customise one to fit one finger but that is with any nails I&#x27;ve had to buy. I&#x27;d purchase again.  Added: delighted to add that the nails that are to big for my fingers were perfect for my toes. If you have ugly toes like me....these cover that up. Pretty hands n feet . I&#x27;m not creative but they turned out great.</li>
