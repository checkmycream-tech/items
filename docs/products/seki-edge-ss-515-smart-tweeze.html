    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Rubiss is still the best tweezer I have found.</li>
            <li>so  impressed that I decided to try the tweezers.</li>
            <li>Over all I am very happy and you probably will be too if you try them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Very good quality for the price.  </li>
            <li>Seki makes great products.</li>
            <li>Seki makes great nail clippers, but its tweezers are sub-standard.  </li>
            <li>The design is great.</li>
            <li>Well that doesn&#x27;t do you any good when the tips do not mesh or match.</li>
            <li>that is pretty impressive.</li>
            <li>Not as grippy on hair as Id like which is kind of the point.  </li>
            <li>Nice design and feel when you hold it,</li>
            <li>, MY CHEAP TWEEZERS WORK BETTER!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, they have a wonderful feel and are very precise.</li>
            <li>There are definitely better tweezers out there at lower price.</li>
            <li>Love these tweezers.</li>
            <li>Teezerman is more hype then performance.</li>
            <li>I was hoping these would be better than my Tweezerman</li>
            <li>I love my Feather Pa-Ra-Da tweezer, but I needed another for travel.  </li>
            <li>The thicker handles allow for greater control and eliminates the deformation most tweezers suffer over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would prefer grippier, but they work ok.</li>
            <li>I wanted a product that was precise and more effective than others I have used.  </li>
            <li>want a replacement, I love how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already bought another one through Amazon and it was delivered today, but an exchange would be fine, in case one breaks again.</li>
            <li>They operate great and get those pesky tiny fine hairs.</li>
            <li>Different concept, works great.</li>
            <li>The metal quality is cheap, and it does not pull hair out well, so I wind up using my feather.  </li>
            <li>These Seki tweezers are fantastic.</li>
            <li>The tips meet very precisely, so it makes it easy to pull out splinters and such.</li>
            <li>He didn&#x27;t use them yet but thought they were pretty cool.</li>
            <li>a different kind of tweezer…do not know if they will be</li>
            <li>I had read about this brand and their innovative design &#x3D; More tweeze with less pressure.</li>
            <li>a long time effective alternative hope</li>
            <li>I bought these tweezers because I love our Seki toenail cutters, which have stayed sharp and easy to use for over a year.</li>
            <li>I remember first having them used on me as a child.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money, but good items the first time.</li>
            <li>These are the best tweezers I have used hands down, wouldn&#x27;t want to use any other brand ever.</li>
            <li>Yes, they really are made in Japan.</li>
            <li>On the back of the original package from 2011 it instructs you to go to their Web Site to find information about their Guarantee.</li>
            <li>However, this Seki Smart Tweeze is spot welded on each half of the Tweezer inside a spring device, very unique until a spot weld gives out.</li>
            <li>but I used another pair for half the price and it had better grip on my beard hairs.</li>
            <li>Itś comfortable, larger than the old fashioned tweezers.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend them...</li>
            <li>priced, I&#x27;m sure they will last a long time</li>
            <li>The extra $ is worth it.</li>
            <li>They are finely adjusted to grab very small items.</li>
            <li>These were a little more expensive but they were no better - the edges don&#x27;t meet accurately so the hair doesn&#x27;t come out on the first attempt (or second or third for that matter.  </li>

            <li> I thought the cost was a bit high, and I still do, but compared to the garbage I bought in the past, these are like surgical instruments.</li>
            <li> It is as I expected, and it does the job</li>

            <li> Only complaint is they didn&#x27;t come with a cover to protect the blades.</li>
            <li> There is very little effort to squeeze the sides of the Seki tweezers due to spring like design.</li>
            <li> After two years, this little tweezer is holding up well.</li>
            <li> The handles and pinching surface have a tenancy to slide side to side, rolling off round</li>
            <li> less expensive and a tighter grip on short hairs.</li>
            <li> Itś design helps keep a tight grip and pulls out hard to get small hairs.  </li>
            <li> no matter how hard you squeeze them.</li>
            <li> So it turns out the quality of the tweezers I bought was poor.</li>
            <li> NOT IMPRESSED!!!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can no longer find Feather tweezers, so I paid $20 for this.  </li>
            <li> They were useless.</li>
            <li> A splinter, or something, painful and stuck in my finger.</li>
            <li> Quite disappointing!</li>
            <li> I hate this piece of junk, every time I see it, I feel like an idiot.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as rigid or stable as i&#x27;d like. There are definitely better tweezers out there at lower price.</li>
            <li> Very good quality for the price.  I would highly recommend them...just what you would expect from a quality company.  Yes, they really are made in Japan.</li>
            <li> Different concept, works great.</li>
            <li> I bought these tweezers because I love our Seki toenail cutters, which have stayed sharp and easy to use for over a year. The design of these tweezers sounded worth trying, but after several months of comparison, I find that they take no less effort than my other tweezers (the upper-end Revlon ones), and the Seki tweezers often just glide off of tough hairs. I&#x27;m going back to Revlon for tweezing, and just buying Seki for nail clippers.</li>
            <li> NOT IMPRESSED!!!  THEY DON&#x27;T WORK, MY CHEAP TWEEZERS WORK BETTER!!</li>
            <li> This is an efficient plucking tweezer.  Itś design helps keep a tight grip and pulls out hard to get small hairs.  Itś comfortable, larger than the old fashioned tweezers.</li>
            <li> Love these tweezers. They operate great and get those pesky tiny fine hairs. Only complaint is they didn&#x27;t come with a cover to protect the blades. They are starting to get dinged up and not work as well.</li>
            <li> I had read about this brand and their innovative design &#x3D; More tweeze with less pressure. Well that doesn&#x27;t do you any good when the tips do not mesh or match. Rubiss is still the best tweezer I have found. Teezerman is more hype then performance. Just remember you cannot return tweezers.</li>
            <li> These are the best tweezers I have used hands down, wouldn&#x27;t want to use any other brand ever. &amp;#34;Two Words&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Item received as described and on time.</li>
            <li> It is as I expected, and it does the job well. The tips meet very precisely, so it makes it easy to pull out splinters and such.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son who travels a lot for work. He didn&#x27;t use them yet but thought they were pretty cool.</li>
            <li> It works.  Not all tweezers work.  My wife loves it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, they have a wonderful feel and are very precise. They exceeded  my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasonably priced, I&#x27;m sure they will last a long time</li>
            <li> Seki makes great products. I started with one of their nail-clippers, I got so  impressed that I decided to try the tweezers. This is really a big deal. As my title says it can pull hair less than one millimeter long and that is pretty impressive. I used before one of Calvin Klein brand tweezers but you cannot compare the two. The point of contact is design to stay flat no matter how hard you squeeze them. There is very little effort to squeeze the sides of the Seki tweezers due to spring like design. Over all I am very happy and you probably will be too if you try them.&lt;br /&gt;I do not work for Seki or sell any of their products.</li>
            <li> I was hoping these would be better than my Tweezerman but they are not. Stick with Tweezerman... less expensive and a tighter grip on short hairs.</li>
            <li> best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Seki makes great nail clippers, but its tweezers are sub-standard.  I love my Feather Pa-Ra-Da tweezer, but I needed another for travel.  Unfortunately, I can no longer find Feather tweezers, so I paid $20 for this.  The metal quality is cheap, and it does not pull hair out well, so I wind up using my feather.  I hate this piece of junk, every time I see it, I feel like an idiot.</li>
            <li> I have found all the Seki items I&#x27;ve purchased to be of the utmost quality. However, this Seki Smart Tweeze is spot welded on each half of the Tweezer inside a spring device, very unique until a spot weld gives out. This item, as with all of their edge tools, have a lifetime Guarantee. On the back of the original package from 2011 it instructs you to go to their Web Site to find information about their Guarantee. I wanted to just exchange it with Amazon but they say it is not an item that can be sent back or replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want a replacement, I love how easy it is to use. So I would actually give it a 5 star rating if the Lifetime Guarantee was backed up through Amazon, where this item was bought. I&#x27;ve already bought another one through Amazon and it was delivered today, but an exchange would be fine, in case one breaks again.</li>
            <li> The design is great. The thicker handles allow for greater control and eliminates the deformation most tweezers suffer over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is that the heft of the handles causes some loss in dexterity. The handles and pinching surface have a tenancy to slide side to side, rolling off round hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should anything ever happen to these, at this point I will defiantly plan to get another pair.</li>
            <li> Not as grippy on hair as Id like which is kind of the point.  Would prefer grippier, but they work ok.</li>
            <li> After two years, this little tweezer is holding up well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a tweezer what can I say other than it feels durable.</li>
            <li> a different kind of tweezer…do not know if they will be a long time effective alternative hope so..</li>
            <li> Nice design and feel when you hold it, but I used another pair for half the price and it had better grip on my beard hairs.</li>
            <li> I have had 3 or 4 different tweezers in my life. I remember first having them used on me as a child. A splinter, or something, painful and stuck in my finger. My mom removed it with tweezers. So when I reached 17 and moved out, eventually I bought a pair. They were useless. So were the next few pair. I begin to feel perhaps &amp;#34;they don&#x27;t make &#x27;em like they used to,&amp;#34; after all, my mom used them. So it turns out the quality of the tweezers I bought was poor. These Seki tweezers are fantastic. Splinters, nose hairs, you name it. They are finely adjusted to grab very small items. I thought the cost was a bit high, and I still do, but compared to the garbage I bought in the past, these are like surgical instruments. Don&#x27;t waste your money, but good items the first time. The extra $ is worth it.</li>
            <li> I wanted a product that was precise and more effective than others I have used.  These were a little more expensive but they were no better - the edges don&#x27;t meet accurately so the hair doesn&#x27;t come out on the first attempt (or second or third for that matter.

            <li> Got a second set for the wife.  Won&#x27;t share mine.</li>
