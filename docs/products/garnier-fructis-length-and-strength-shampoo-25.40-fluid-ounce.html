            <li>Now, they&#x27;re all perfect.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great!  </li>
            <li>Works best with the matching conditioner.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is very good.  </li>
            <li>Great for the price.</li>
            <li>and I thought it was a great deal for all of the shampoo I got for a good price.</li>
            <li>This product smells good, but since I haven&#x27;t bought another one to continue</li>
            <li>smells good and seems to do its job.</li>
            <li>Cheaper isn&#x27;t always better!</li>
            <li>It took 3 or 4 days of \\&quot;search and destroy\\&quot; to get most of them out!</li>
            <li>Great price, lots of product for fantastic results.</li>
            <li>but mainly I liked this because I think it made my hair grow.</li>
            <li>A nice fragrance</li>

            <li>This us my sons favorite all time go to shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I find that I have fewer split ends and am able to grow it to a length that I want.  </li>
            <li>It went from helping, to drying out my ends and causing many splits.</li>
            <li>and my hair is also more manageable and feels healthier.</li>
            <li>everything to love about this product.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff to death.</li>
            <li>Great product, I highly recommend it, lives up to the name &amp;#34;Length and Strength&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>my boyfriend likes it :)</li>
            <li>Easy to rinse out.</li>
            <li>Others they seem to work fine on...</li>
            <li>The fresh aroma stays with you for days and its perfect for long hair.</li>
            <li>My hair&#x27;s texture is smooth, it has shine, no breakage, etc.  </li>
            <li>Nice, full of volume and my hair looks so much healthier, even though I dye it.</li>
            <li>I am going cone free, because though this was the best I had found so far, after regular use the cones built up and damaged my hair.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair clean and lightweight.</li>
            <li>and I could go two full nights without washing my hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like that the scent isn&#x27;t very strong, but I&#x27;ll live.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t have to use a bunch of other products because it doesn&#x27;t cause fly away hair.</li>
            <li>And the price was right.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m so buying this forever and the price is right</li>
            <li>and it really gets your hair clean.  </li>
            <li>great shampoo for people with hard to grow hair</li>
            <li>My first cut was in January 2003 and my seventh was in April 2012</li>
            <li>My hair is SO much healthier now!</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, but have always wanted it to be very long.</li>
            <li>The shine is back and my hair hasn&#x27;t seemed so full and bouncy in years!</li>
            <li>I feel like a bit of a commercial right now, but it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>My split dry ends look much better, and my whole length looks much shinier and feels softer!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really think they changed the formula.</li>
            <li>It could be in my head, but i really think it helps my hair grow longer and faster.</li>
            <li>Also, my hair became very brittle and I noticed I had a ton of hear breakage and hair was falling out in clumps.  </li>
            <li>Well with this I can barely go one full night without washing my hair</li>
            <li>I bought this length and Strength a few days ago, and after 3 washes, am absolutely thrilled.</li>
            <li>I like it so much that I use Sleek and Shine, Daily Care, or (currently) Pure Clean when my hair is shorter.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t ever be able to have hair down to my waist, but this enables me to have healthy looking hair down to my shoulder blades.</li>
            <li>But as I got older and cut my hair shorter</li>
            <li>It also made it super greasy looking, even right after washing after about half of the bottle was used.</li>
            <li>Nature&#x27;s Gate Herbal Daily Cleansing and Conditioning is much better than this, in the long run.</li>
            <li>I have long shiny hair and have purchased many different kinds of shampoo at the recommendation of my stylist</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind it, it does clean, but for me it&#x27;s not very well.</li>
            <li>Recently, to fix the problems I began Light Mountain Red henna treatments and using Natures Gate, now my issues are gone.</li>
            <li>I now have silky soft hair again!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and it has grown some since I started using it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday, I try to go every other day or every two days because it&#x27;s better for curly wavy hair types.</li>
            <li>Good product but people didn&#x27;t deserve this huge price increase, the outrageous price is the reason it was taken off the store shelves.</li>
            <li>My first few cuts before using Length and Strength did have split ends.  </li>
            <li>Have bought other, highly advertised and much more expensive shampoo without these results.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down and there is no heavy residue.</li>
            <li> For BOTH my wife and I, with very different hair and skin, this creates pimples or sores on our scalps and leaves us with very dry hair.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t have a problem growing long without this product.</li>
            <li> Tried Herbal Essences, Long Term Relationship, and it made me look greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to grow it long since 2006</li>
            <li> As everyone knows combing wet long hair can leave you struggling with tangles.</li>
            <li> last cut was 26 months from the previous cut, and I had no split ends at all.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try this because I have really long thin, straight hair which seems to be getting thinner as I age.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair and after time I saw some improvement</li>
            <li> I gave my hair a few day break from this harsh shampoo and started using a more expensive salon shampoo and my hair stopped falling out.  </li>
            <li> Right now my hair is about 30 inches long, and the ends were starting to dry out really bad.</li>
            <li> A couple of weeks after using it, I noticed my hair was oilier than usual even after washing it daily.  </li>
            <li> I have right now a little past shoulder blades length of hair, and I couldn&#x27;t even go out the next day because I had the feeling of almost dirty hair,</li>
            <li> My hair is slow to grow and I always envied the long below your waist line hair</li>
            <li> I found it difficult to grow back the long billowing hair I once had.</li>
            <li> , I get a little oily.</li>
            <li> Should use for a few months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Garnier Fructis Length and Strength for years (not sure when I started).  </li>
            <li> But, this will do, for at least a few washes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m serious, this stuff is a chemical disaster.</li>
            <li> my hair only grew to the bottom of my shoulderblades and stopped :(</li>
            <li> I got Tre Semme Split Remedy, which made it worse.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, hard to grow hair.</li>
            <li> It also gives us both BAD dandruff.</li>
            <li> With all the boxes labeled \\&quot;BAD SANITATION\\&quot;?</li>
            <li> Turns out to be the worst shampoo we&#x27;ve ever used.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Keeps my hair blond all winter without dying because of the lemon in it.  I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have this hair, makes my hair to flat</li>
            <li> I grow my hair out for Locks of Love.  My first cut was in January 2003 and my seventh was in April 2012 (total amount of 82 inches donated from the seven cuts).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last cut was 26 months from the previous cut, and I had no split ends at all.  I&#x27;ve used Garnier Fructis Length and Strength for years (not sure when I started).  My hair&#x27;s texture is smooth, it has shine, no breakage, etc.  I like it so much that I use Sleek and Shine, Daily Care, or (currently) Pure Clean when my hair is shorter.  All do wonderfully for my hair, which can be defined as normal.  My first few cuts before using Length and Strength did have split ends.  Now, they&#x27;re all perfect.  It&#x27;s great!  I&#x27;m unsure of how it works for people who torment their hair with a lot of blow-drying, teasing, product, etc because I just wash and comb (seldom use a blow-dryer).  But, it works for me and deserves the five-star rating.</li>
            <li> The reason for the 3 stars. I don&#x27;t mind it, it does clean, but for me it&#x27;s not very well. I really think they changed the formula. I had trial size shampoo of this and I could go two full nights without washing my hair. Well with this I can barely go one full night without washing my hair, I get a little oily. I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday, I try to go every other day or every two days because it&#x27;s better for curly wavy hair types. I am using this up and the smaller bottles I got of this and not going to use them anymore. I tried using this and and the conditioner, doesn&#x27;t work for me. I have right now a little past shoulder blades length of hair, and I couldn&#x27;t even go out the next day because I had the feeling of almost dirty hair, like you can touch it two times and it&#x27;d be gross. So I wont miss this stuff when  I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 of these big sizes to only pay the shipping price once and I thought it was a great deal for all of the shampoo I got for a good price. It could be in my head, but i really think it helps my hair grow longer and faster.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair and after time I saw some improvement but mainly I liked this because I think it made my hair grow. Works best with the matching conditioner. Great for the price. Should use for a few months.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair clean and lightweight. Easy to rinse out.</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo and conditioner. It makes my hair so soft and it has grown some since I started using it. Thank you for the product.</li>
            <li> We bought two bottles of this from Costco. Turns out to be the worst shampoo we&#x27;ve ever used. For BOTH my wife and I, with very different hair and skin, this creates pimples or sores on our scalps and leaves us with very dry hair. It also gives us both BAD dandruff. My wife says that my mom also tried this stuff and got the same result - sores and dandruff. What on earth? How is this stuff permitted by the FDA?! I&#x27;m serious, this stuff is a chemical disaster. Anybody seen \\&quot;Todd Margaret\\&quot;? With all the boxes labeled \\&quot;BAD SANITATION\\&quot;? It makes me think of this stuff. It&#x27;s the hair care apocalypse... enjoy! :)</li>
            <li> This us my sons favorite all time go to shampoo. He likes he smell and how it makes his hair feel.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo at Target and regret it.  A couple of weeks after using it, I noticed my hair was oilier than usual even after washing it daily.  Also, my hair became very brittle and I noticed I had a ton of hear breakage and hair was falling out in clumps.  I got scared and went and talked to my hairdresser who advised I stop washing my hair in this stuff.  I gave my hair a few day break from this harsh shampoo and started using a more expensive salon shampoo and my hair stopped falling out.  You get what you pay for.  Cheaper isn&#x27;t always better!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is very good.  A nice fragrance and it really gets your hair clean.  And the price was right.  No problems with this item.</li>
            <li> I think my hair has become stronger with regular use of this shampoo and conditioner...Works well for my hair</li>
            <li> Used it for years! Will continue to buy!</li>
            <li> great shampoo for people with hard to grow hair</li>
            <li> This product smells good, but since I haven&#x27;t bought another one to continue it&#x27;s use... I haven&#x27;t seen results in strength. My hair doesn&#x27;t have a problem growing long without this product.</li>
            <li> Good product but people didn&#x27;t deserve this huge price increase, the outrageous price is the reason it was taken off the store shelves. I&#x27;ve spoken with all my friends and they will not pay these prices. Gone back to PANTEEN.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My hair is very fine and this cleans it without drying it.  I find that I have fewer split ends and am able to grow it to a length that I want.  I won&#x27;t ever be able to have hair down to my waist, but this enables me to have healthy looking hair down to my shoulder blades.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, but have always wanted it to be very long. Right now my hair is about 30 inches long, and the ends were starting to dry out really bad. I got Tre Semme Split Remedy, which made it worse. Tried Herbal Essences, Long Term Relationship, and it made me look greasy. Also... my dermatologist actually had that one listed as one of the two shampoos that causes lots of acne! - YIKES! I bought this length and Strength a few days ago, and after 3 washes, am absolutely thrilled. I don&#x27;t like that the scent isn&#x27;t very strong, but I&#x27;ll live. It has taken me forever to find a shampoo and conditioner that works on my length of hair this nicely. I hope I&#x27;m still a fan by the end of the bottle. My split dry ends look much better, and my whole length looks much shinier and feels softer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** I am editing this in Dec 2012****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have left this product, to use Nature&#x27;s Gate Herbal Daily Cleansing shampoo and conditioner. I am going cone free, because though this was the best I had found so far, after regular use the cones built up and damaged my hair. It also made it super greasy looking, even right after washing after about half of the bottle was used. It went from helping, to drying out my ends and causing many splits. It took 3 or 4 days of \\&quot;search and destroy\\&quot; to get most of them out! Nothing in my routine or diet had changed, so I assume it was the shampoo and conditioner.  Recently, to fix the problems I began Light Mountain Red henna treatments and using Natures Gate, now my issues are gone. Nature&#x27;s Gate Herbal Daily Cleansing and Conditioning is much better than this, in the long run. But, this will do, for at least a few washes.  Then it might make you greasy and splitty.( Its the ingredients ending in \\&quot;cone\\&quot; that do it for some people. Others they seem to work fine on... your hair will let you know! )</li>
            <li> My hair is slow to grow and I always envied the long below your waist line hair I had growing up. But as I got older and cut my hair shorter I found it difficult to grow back the long billowing hair I once had. But when I bought this Length and Strength hair + the conditioner it made hair growth alot quicker. Probably in a month my hair was alot longer than before and my hair is also more manageable and feels healthier. So if you&#x27;re trying to grow out your hair but it&#x27;s taking awhile try this shampoo and the conditioner. It will boost your hair growth dramatically !</li>
            <li> The scent the silkiness the softness..everything to love about this product. The fresh aroma stays with you for days and its perfect for long hair. As everyone knows combing wet long hair can leave you struggling with tangles. Not anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so buying this forever and the price is right</li>
            <li> I have long shiny hair and have purchased many different kinds of shampoo at the recommendation of my stylist but I used Garnier Fructis as a child and have always come back to this.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, hard to grow hair. I&#x27;ve been trying to grow it long since 2006 (it&#x27;s currently 2014). In 2006 it was at my shoulders. In the 7 years between 2006 and 2013 my hair only grew to the bottom of my shoulderblades and stopped :( Nothing I did would make it grow longer, until (about a year ago) I started using this length and strength shampoo and conditioner. My hair is SO much healthier now! It&#x27;s grown not only longer (several inches in a year!) but fuller, thicker, and silkier! I feel like a bit of a commercial right now, but it&#x27;s true. I love this stuff to death. I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anymore (oh no!) so I&#x27;ve started buying it online instead. Phew!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short: Great product, I highly recommend it, lives up to the name &amp;#34;Length and Strength&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> smells good and seems to do its job. i&#x27;ve only been using it for about 4 weeks now. my boyfriend likes it :)</li>
            <li> I decided to try this because I have really long thin, straight hair which seems to be getting thinner as I age. This seems to be doing the trick! The shine is back and my hair hasn&#x27;t seemed so full and bouncy in years! It doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down and there is no heavy residue. I also don&#x27;t have to use a bunch of other products because it doesn&#x27;t cause fly away hair. Nice, full of volume and my hair looks so much healthier, even though I dye it. I now have silky soft hair again! Have bought other, highly advertised and much more expensive shampoo without these results. Great price, lots of product for fantastic results. A definite keeper!</li>
