            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>I have used this for many years and can&#x27;t get by without it.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, most powders don&#x27;t cover my acne scars and leave me still looking speckled.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and will probably continue using it for years to come.</li>
            <li>Thank you :)</li>
            <li>I love the Aquasmoothe foundation.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>This one performs better than the Clinique, and for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>Once you find the right color, this is a great light foundation.</li>
            <li>I can sometimes get a good deal ordering it here online, arrives fast sealed &amp; as described.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and they got to me in perfect new condition.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and</li>
            <li>It would be fine use as a powder to set real foundation after it is applied, but if you want any kind of coverage at all, this is not the product.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, and if you can find it on here cheap enough....</li>
            <li>Lightly using powder I have found tends to give me that look.</li>
            <li>This is amazing foundation covers very</li>
            <li>to cover, so a light foundation will do for me.  </li>
            <li>Light coverage.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this, it was given to me as a gift from my aunt</li>
            <li>It provides pretty good coverage for me for the first 5 hours</li>
            <li>Heading on original stats package of two, but as you scroll through and pick colors sellers change.  </li>
            <li>Good product, use it daily.</li>
            <li>This one is surprisingly good, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>Good for days when you don&#x27;t wanna go full out or if you only need to even out your complexion.</li>
            <li>I use this without any foundation and my face looks more natural, not cakey.  </li>
            <li>The one I bought right before this one was from Clinique.</li>
            <li>First off, I prefer a more natural look.</li>
            <li>After repeated use, I lightly scrape the powder&#x27;s surface to loosen, and it presents as new.</li>
            <li>(she has more money then a 20 something who just opened a business that demands time and money, movies are expensive to make LOL)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to use it for a slight cover up to even skin tone.  </li>
            <li>Sun just makes me burn, not tan ;)</li>
            <li>This stuff actually covers my acne scars and makes me look more even-toned.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any idea why this has anything higher than one star.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and appears natural.  </li>
            <li>This makeup has good coverage without being heavy looking.  </li>
            <li>The makeup is fine, the packaging fine, but price is too high for only one compact.  </li>
            <li>I have large pores and  oily skin</li>
            <li>I read some of the 4 and 5 star reviews, and while some really like it, others do state that they use this as a powder over foundation, or they have to use another foundation to cover marks, and then use this one.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I apply it with a puff, not the enclosed sponge, and I get a light, complete coverage that looks exceptionally natural, not mask-like or clownish.  </li>
            <li>I love CoverGirl products, but I also love some other major and minor brands</li>
            <li>We always buy Classic Ivory and Creamy Natural.</li>
            <li>light and last long. ..</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, acne prone skin</li>
            <li>I have been using this foundation for several years and really like it.</li>
            <li>It covers pretty well, and does not look dry or get cakey.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not super heavy but not to light either!!</li>
            <li>As other one and two star rating reviewers have stated - this is NOT foundation - it is pure powder.  </li>
            <li>I would like something a little heavier to cover brown marks and red veins, but it does lighten the appearance of them pretty well for a foundation.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The only downfall is that it doesn&#x27;t always completely last throughout the day, but it does to a point a second application can fix any spots where it has failed.</li>
            <li> about every other month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love CoverGirl but little disappointed in this one.  </li>
            <li> Like that we don&#x27;t have to mess with liquid foundations and messy powders.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (She usually uses Covergirl concealer.)</li>
            <li> Not sure.  </li>
            <li> like how well it covers everything, and although it is heavy for a powder it isn&#x27;t heavy as a foundation itself, oil bases are worse.</li>
            <li> Was not impressed with the coverage and does not stay put very long</li>
            <li> My face has starting breaking out really bad since I started using this foundation.</li>
            <li> Disappointed the 2-pack won&#x27;t ship to Hawaii anymore, but appreciate that these people care enough to send to us!</li>
            <li> They couldn&#x27;t match her coloring, and she found the concealers way too thick and difficult to wash off.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good product, use it daily.</li>
            <li> Best makeup I&#x27;ve ever used.  Coverage and moisture control in one product.  MARVY!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and coverage is good.  Great for oily skin.</li>
            <li> I love this powder. Sometimes I use it  with a foundation and sometimes without. Both ways it looks great and stays all day. The coverage is nice. It&#x27;s the quality you would expect from CoverGirl. Shipping was fast and they got to me in perfect new condition.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I always buy this from amazon now. Always a good price. Disappointed the 2-pack won&#x27;t ship to Hawaii anymore, but appreciate that these people care enough to send to us! We always buy Classic Ivory and Creamy Natural. They are perfectly matched to our skin tones. Like that we don&#x27;t have to mess with liquid foundations and messy powders.&lt;br /&gt;BTW, my daughter was gifted with a MAC makeup trip. They couldn&#x27;t match her coloring, and she found the concealers way too thick and difficult to wash off. (She usually uses Covergirl concealer.) She also has experienced a bout of acne over the past few months and found MAC made it worse! (Who woulda thunk?!) Now she&#x27;s just returning everything and will maybe try their colors since CoverGirl isn&#x27;t so great with that. Foundation and Concealer, though, stay with safe-use CoverGirl.</li>
            <li> This is the only pressed powder foundation my daughter uses. It covers well without being cakey. The only problem we have had is it does tend to break and scatter when dropped. oops.</li>
            <li> This is strictly a power, not a creamy substance that turns to powder as I hoped it would be.  Still works well over foundation however...</li>
            <li> I always use this product! Good price for what you get.  I use # 510 and am fair skinned. Sun just makes me burn, not tan ;)</li>
            <li> Love this.  I have used this for many years and can&#x27;t get by without it.  I keep one in my purse and one on my vanity.  I have large pores and  oily skin and this helps keep my skin looking great. I use it under my foundation, then for touch ups later in the day. It also feels great on my skin.  At my age, (53) I thought dry skin would replace my oily skin but that just hasn&#x27;t happened, at all.</li>
            <li> I have used this make-up for years. I&#x27;ve tried other kinds throughout the years but nothing works like this. First off, I prefer a more natural look. Lightly using powder I have found tends to give me that look. Unfortunately, most powders don&#x27;t cover my acne scars and leave me still looking speckled. This stuff actually covers my acne scars and makes me look more even-toned. The only downfall is that it doesn&#x27;t always completely last throughout the day, but it does to a point a second application can fix any spots where it has failed. I love this stuff and will probably continue using it for years to come.</li>
            <li> This is amazing foundation covers very we&#x27;ll but doesn&#x27;t give you the orange look it&#x27;s not super heavy but not to light either!! Best foundation I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> I have used this make-up for years! I have sensitive, acne prone skin and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with this. Doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, good coverage. Amazon has the best pricing!!! Thank you :)</li>
            <li> My face has starting breaking out really bad since I started using this foundation. It has a great color and covers the blemishes it causes.</li>
            <li> It was just ok!  I love CoverGirl but little disappointed in this one.  I love the Aquasmoothe foundation.</li>
            <li> This foundation is lightweight and gives medium coverage without feeling caked-on.  Great buy: I have paid twice this price at the local drug store and grocery stores.  Definitely recommended!!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Great coverage!</li>
            <li> always awesome product</li>
            <li> Product is easy to apply and covers great. I would order it again!</li>
            <li> As other one and two star rating reviewers have stated - this is NOT foundation - it is pure powder.  It would be fine use as a powder to set real foundation after it is applied, but if you want any kind of coverage at all, this is not the product.  I don&#x27;t have any acne or scars etc. to cover, so a light foundation will do for me.  But - again - this is only powder - nothing else.  I have used different kinds of foundations over the years - liquid, cream, cream to powder, whipped, etc. so I know what is foundation and what is not.  I don&#x27;t have any idea why this has anything higher than one star.  I purchased this 06/15 and received it yesterday, and I am doing this review today. Maybe the formula changed?  I read some of the 4 and 5 star reviews, and while some really like it, others do state that they use this as a powder over foundation, or they have to use another foundation to cover marks, and then use this one.  A lot seem to be in 2012.  Not sure.  This is not for me.</li>
            <li> Once you find the right color, this is a great light foundation. Good for days when you don&#x27;t wanna go full out or if you only need to even out your complexion. Light coverage.</li>
            <li> Really good every day foundation. .very light and last long. ..</li>
            <li> My wife says this works perfectly</li>
            <li> Was not impressed with the coverage and does not stay put very long</li>
            <li> This is a great product, and if you can find it on here cheap enough....since I can buy this product at my local stores for around $6-$8.....I can sometimes get a good deal ordering it here online, arrives fast sealed &amp; as described. I&#x27;ve ordered a total of 4-5 of these foundations &amp; would def recommend ordering. In fact I&#x27;m gonna place another order today or tomorrow. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have been using this foundation for several years and really like it. It provides pretty good coverage for me for the first 5 hours or so then I have to reapply to my cheekbone areas.</li>
            <li> I love CoverGirl products, but I also love some other major and minor brands so I&#x27;m not being brand bias. I enjoy this, it was given to me as a gift from my aunt (she has more money then a 20 something who just opened a business that demands time and money, movies are expensive to make LOL) and I get it each time she comes to visit, about every other month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how well it covers everything, and although it is heavy for a powder it isn&#x27;t heavy as a foundation itself, oil bases are worse.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great price and amazing product!!!!! thank you</li>
            <li> This makeup has good coverage without being heavy looking.  It goes on smoothly and appears natural.  I would like something a little heavier to cover brown marks and red veins, but it does lighten the appearance of them pretty well for a foundation.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a replacement for Maybelline PureStay powder foundation since it was discontinued.  I have purchased 5 powder foundations in the process. This one is surprisingly good, especially for the price.  The one I bought right before this one was from Clinique. This one performs better than the Clinique, and for a fraction of the price. It covers pretty well, and does not look dry or get cakey. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and I hope it stays around in years ahead. I apply it with a puff, not the enclosed sponge, and I get a light, complete coverage that looks exceptionally natural, not mask-like or clownish.  After repeated use, I lightly scrape the powder&#x27;s surface to loosen, and it presents as new.</li>
            <li> I use this without any foundation and my face looks more natural, not cakey.  It&#x27;s good to use it for a slight cover up to even skin tone.  It works well with oily skin.</li>

            <li> I have been wearing CoverGirl Simply Powder Foundation for several years. It has great coverage and goes on smooth.  Since it is in powder form, you don&#x27;t need to apply anything else.</li>
