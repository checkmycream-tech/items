            <li>Take a nice, hot Epsom salt bath!  </li>
            <li>and I appreciate the easily resealable bag.</li>
            <li>I put about 1/3 cup in the foot bath container, put in hot water to dissolve the salt, then add warm water so as not to scald feet.  </li>
            <li>I have a torn tendon in my knee and tendonitis in my ankles thanks to 12 years of another kind of work.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several different brands of Epsom salt, and the Morton product works best, as the salt crystals are milled very fine, which allows them to dissolve quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>Any brand epsom salt is good, relaxing, and cures minor surface skin infections, body acne, impetigo, better than antibiotic ointment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for removing toxins from your system and skin, and good for soaking tired feet too.</li>
            <li>It has the right &amp;#34;ingredients&amp;#34; for our use and should work just fine.</li>
            <li>Big bag , good quality product</li>
            <li>I am always searching for bulk epsom salt options, because I go through it so quickly when using it as directed.</li>
            <li>Exactly how it was described!</li>
            <li>Cut open toop and a nice press it together reseal.</li>
            <li>Nothing else too exciting about it.</li>
            <li>I really liked that it was a big bag</li>
            <li>An open container of scented bath salts is a nice fragrance for the bathroom.</li>
            <li>I needed the extra money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, thank God for good old Epsom salt.  </li>
            <li>Follow that with a moisturizer and his feet are very much improved.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so much of a relief!  </li>
            <li>Just dissolve about 2 cups of Epsom salt into a hot bath and soak for 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>and Morton is pretty realiable brand in my opinion)</li>
            <li>Table spoons of skin safe essential oils</li>
            <li>can just add them right in with your detergent.&lt;br /&gt;It softens hard water, and makes your clothes smell amazing!</li>
            <li>As a hot soak in the tub, this stuff really works.</li>
            <li>Salts dissolve quickly with no residue and make the water soft and soothing.  </li>
            <li>Like the product but ordered the 20 lb bag from SF Salts as this ran out too fast.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these to anyone else!</li>
            <li>product , work as expected and have many uses</li>
            <li>Got it on time and ready to use it.</li>
            <li>; so that i would end up &amp;#34;smelling very manly (wood like..ish)&amp;#34; and boy howdy; I do get attention.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>and this is a very convenient size.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anybody who needs relief of pain and cant readily go to the store.</li>
            <li>I used this in a bathsalts recipe and it worked very well.</li>
            <li>Before you buy, please read the full following articles:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It helps with taking out a little bit of bloat, and makes my muscles relax more than in just a normal bath.</li>
            <li>Disolved at a normal rate</li>
            <li>If you want a new way of using epsom salt, here it is.</li>
            <li>I will note that I&#x27;ve since been told that it detoxes not only impurities from your body but medicine as well so if you are going to order this, talk with your doctor first before taking a bath in it if you take medicine.</li>
            <li>I pour the bag into a clear glass canister and place on the sink, it looks decorative and is practical.</li>
            <li>Though Epsom salt is dirt-cheap, no research supports any direct effect on injury recovery, and none of the theories forwarded about how Epsom salt might help in indirect ways</li>
            <li>I soak nearly every day to relieve muscle tension and pain.</li>
            <li>After soaking, the dry skin is easy to rub off with a rough washcloth or pumice stone.  </li>
            <li>Folk remedies are often generally neglected by researchers, but not usually so completely.&amp;#34; -- Paul Ingraham</li>
            <li>Just as expected and very fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time the other day.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied, and recommend this product to everyone that suffers from Fibromyalgia Disease (FMS) and any &amp;#34;type of body and/or specific type of back pain&amp;#34;!</li>

            <li> Barring future research, it&#x27;s very hard to justify an Epsom salt bath over a traditional ice bath or hot water bath for treating an injury.</li>
            <li> complete, put in an air tight container.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Intuition told me not to use it, which is strange.  </li>
            <li> A nurse recommended Epsom Salts to soak husband&#x27;s feet to get rid of dry skin that flakes off (athlete&#x27;s foot).  </li>
            <li> Never have dry skin, even in Maine winters.</li>
            <li> well, leave out to dry for about 2-3 hours.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> They used to sell them at my CVS in a milk carton like container for a few bucks, but no such luck anymore, Will purchase from here until i can find them again at a local store</li>
            <li> Lasted a very long time!</li>
            <li> Not much else to say about it.</li>
            <li> a few days later it is at my door step.</li>
            <li> but from other vendors.</li>
            <li> Other less expensive grocery store brands I&#x27;ve tried are much coarser, taking longer to dissolve and not as luxurious feeling.</li>
            <li> I previously had not known you could use this for anything other than feet!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little easier to pack than cartons for road trips, because of the flexible packaging, and the bag is tough and doesn&#x27;t seem prone to popping open and spilling salt everywhere if it&#x27;s partially used.</li>
            <li> A little background.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> For those of you unfamiliar with the work, this means lifting, walking, carrying and pushing (on a cart) heavy packages.  </li>
            <li> was click a few button and</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;(OPTIONAL) Leave plain, or use 3-4 drops food coloring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just plain epsom salt.</li>
            <li> I was unable to find even a single scientific paper studying their effect on body pain.</li>
            <li> Epsom salt is just one of those things you always keep around for the occasional sprain, or to soften toenails for cutting, or to reduce a swelling, and even to remove a stubborn splinter.</li>
            <li> Also, it helps to sooth the paws of allergic dogs, when soaked for 5 minutes in a shallow tub of water consisting of a tablespoon or so of the salt.</li>
            <li> I suffer from horrifyingly, painful Fibromyalgia Disease (FMS) and a few other things, too.  </li>
            <li> Overly tired?  </li>
            <li> My Physical Therapist recommended that I purchase this product in combination with &amp;#34;Glycerin and Bubble Bath (see below)&amp;#34; to sooth my horrifyingly, aching body while taking a bath.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to find without scent added.  </li>
            <li> and that ill</li>
            <li> search for scientific evidence concerning Epsom salt baths was disappointing.</li>
            <li> I suffer from horrible joint pain that creeps up in the evenings, I took a bath with this product and my pain subsided within a few minutes of soaking in the bath.</li>
            <li> What bad things can anyone say about Epsom Salt?</li>
            <li> this one, however, gave my skin a terrible rush (although one would wonder what can go wrong with epsom salt?</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s.. Epsom salt. Not much else to say about it.</li>
            <li> I bought this and It arrive in good condition. Cut open toop and a nice press it together reseal. Worked like bathsalts. Disolved at a normal rate</li>
            <li> Like the product but ordered the 20 lb bag from SF Salts as this ran out too fast. I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> Stressed?  Overly tired?  Feel toxic?  Take a nice, hot Epsom salt bath!  It&#x27;s great for removing toxins from your system and skin, and good for soaking tired feet too.</li>
            <li> Good salt, have been using it to take detox baths. It dissolves well in warm water. Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> A nurse recommended Epsom Salts to soak husband&#x27;s feet to get rid of dry skin that flakes off (athlete&#x27;s foot).  Use this once or twice a week and am seeing definite improvement in skin.  I put about 1/3 cup in the foot bath container, put in hot water to dissolve the salt, then add warm water so as not to scald feet.  After soaking, the dry skin is easy to rub off with a rough washcloth or pumice stone.  Follow that with a moisturizer and his feet are very much improved.</li>
            <li> perfect for bath salts!</li>
            <li> Works great for pain associated with ovarian cysts and/or endometriosis. Just dissolve about 2 cups of Epsom salt into a hot bath and soak for 10-15 minutes. Eases and soothes pain and achiness associated with these conditions. I&#x27;ve used several different brands of Epsom salt, and the Morton product works best, as the salt crystals are milled very fine, which allows them to dissolve quickly and easily. Other less expensive grocery store brands I&#x27;ve tried are much coarser, taking longer to dissolve and not as luxurious feeling. I pour the bag into a clear glass canister and place on the sink, it looks decorative and is practical. Also, it helps to sooth the paws of allergic dogs, when soaked for 5 minutes in a shallow tub of water consisting of a tablespoon or so of the salt.</li>
            <li> I use Epson salt mixed with some sea salt for my weekly bathes...this one, however, gave my skin a terrible rush (although one would wonder what can go wrong with epsom salt? and Morton is pretty realiable brand in my opinion)...Amazon&#x27;s customer service is superb - they immediately reimbursed me the cost. I continue to use Epsom salt but from other vendors.</li>
            <li> I am always searching for bulk epsom salt options, because I go through it so quickly when using it as directed. I buy these bags four at a time for the free shipping and am very pleased! In general, epsom salts are a wonderful way to sooth sore muscles. I use them regularly in the evenings, after workouts, and as a follow-up to massage or chiropractor appointments.</li>
            <li> Found this at costco for $8 for 12 lbs.  That&#x27;s 50 cents a pound!!! On here you are paying $3 a pound.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Let me just say that I&#x27;m not into any kinds of alternative medicine or homeopathy or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does make me feel better when I have a bath in it though. It helps with taking out a little bit of bloat, and makes my muscles relax more than in just a normal bath. I would highly recommend these to anyone else!</li>
            <li> This was suggested to us for getting rid of moss on the rocks under our deck at our cabin.  It was difficult to find without scent added.  It has the right &amp;#34;ingredients&amp;#34; for our use and should work just fine.</li>
            <li> Any brand epsom salt is good, relaxing, and cures minor surface skin infections, body acne, impetigo, better than antibiotic ointment.</li>
            <li> Overpriced but if you need some and keep forgetting it at the store, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> As a hot soak in the tub, this stuff really works.</li>
            <li> Worked great with my fibromyalgia.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and transaction...Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Great service and price.</li>
            <li> Lasted a very long time!</li>
            <li> Great bath soak for my joints!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and well priced!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I put it in my bath every night.  Never have dry skin, even in Maine winters.</li>
            <li> I bought this prior to the Christmas season.  Intuition told me not to use it, which is strange.  During Christmastime I became a driver helper for UPS.  For those of you unfamiliar with the work, this means lifting, walking, carrying and pushing (on a cart) heavy packages.  I needed the extra money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, thank God for good old Epsom salt.  These bags are very convenient and not too heavy.  They kept me from being so sore I couldn&#x27;t move (well, that in combination with a cream and some Alleve from time to time).  I have a torn tendon in my knee and tendonitis in my ankles thanks to 12 years of another kind of work.  As a woman, I am truly grateful.</li>
            <li> I love epsom salt. This was a great price amd works great.</li>
            <li> $11 is an outrages price.  After I had ordered this Epsom salt, I went to wall Mart and bought 8 lbs for $6 and 4 lbs for $3.</li>
            <li> Wish they were a bit cheaper but I cannot find them in my drugstore anymore. They used to sell them at my CVS in a milk carton like container for a few bucks, but no such luck anymore, Will purchase from here until i can find them again at a local store</li>
            <li> What bad things can anyone say about Epsom Salt? This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Big bag , good quality product I think the price is correct since is plenty&lt;br /&gt;of product , work as expected and have many uses</li>
            <li> Got it on time and ready to use it. We are a family that practices BJJ and wrestling, a great product to enhance your body.</li>
            <li> Epsom salt is so good for my skin! Salt heals the skin so well I use it in distilled water to spray my face after a shower to prevent or minimize breakouts as well as in the bathtub of my infant twins to heal any diaper rash. Epsom salt goes into this mama&#x27;s bath too- to de-stress!</li>
            <li> My daughter used salts in bath water to soak and it works for her [since she has HSV1 ] because it alleviates flare ups ( bumps, sores etc) and minimizes the inflammations (redness, scaly skin and such). Although i use as a laxative and it works effectively with no problem since I drink alot of soda and as a result mucho gas.</li>
            <li> Great product, but kind of high priced. I bought this as an addon for Prime. A lot more expensive than the store.</li>
            <li> A little background. I suffer from horrifyingly, painful Fibromyalgia Disease (FMS) and a few other things, too.  My Physical Therapist recommended that I purchase this product in combination with &amp;#34;Glycerin and Bubble Bath (see below)&amp;#34; to sooth my horrifyingly, aching body while taking a bath. You combine, &amp;#34;2 cups of Epsom Salts, 1 teaspoon of Glycerin, and 50 Drops of the Bubble Bath (see next sentence), then place under running water in your bathtub.  Also, I purchased (from AMAZON) THE &amp;#34;Active Organics Bubble Bath Cedar SPA - Anti Stress  in (Ceder Scent (manly scent),&amp;#34; so that i would end up &amp;#34;smelling very manly (wood like..ish)&amp;#34; and boy howdy; I do get attention. (Yes, ladies, there is Lavender Scent , too).  The end result is that the combination of these three products they they sooth your entire body, really awesome! I am very satisfied, and recommend this product to everyone that suffers from Fibromyalgia Disease (FMS) and any &amp;#34;type of body and/or specific type of back pain&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> way too expense go to your local store</li>
            <li> Works well, seems good quality and I can add my own scents and oils</li>
            <li> Epsom salt is just one of those things you always keep around for the occasional sprain, or to soften toenails for cutting, or to reduce a swelling, and even to remove a stubborn splinter.</li>
            <li> Great price! Fast shipping. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Mortons Epsom Salt!! It&#x27;s great for taking the soreness out, having a spa night, their very multipurpose. If you want a new way of using epsom salt, here it is. (If you love purex crystals, or downy beads, you&#x27;ll LOVE this)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take a 4 pound bag of epsom salt.&lt;br /&gt;2 Table spoons of skin safe essential oils&lt;br /&gt;(OPTIONAL) Leave plain, or use 3-4 drops food coloring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix well, leave out to dry for about 2-3 hours.&lt;br /&gt;After complete, put in an air tight container.&lt;br /&gt;Use 1/8 cup on medium loads of laundry.&lt;br /&gt;You can just add them right in with your detergent.&lt;br /&gt;It softens hard water, and makes your clothes smell amazing!</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time the other day. I previously had not known you could use this for anything other than feet! However, taking a bath in it is relaxing. I will note that I&#x27;ve since been told that it detoxes not only impurities from your body but medicine as well so if you are going to order this, talk with your doctor first before taking a bath in it if you take medicine. It was delivered quickly and in excellent shape, no packaging problems.</li>
            <li> I go through Epsom Salt in job lots and this is a very convenient size. It&#x27;s a little easier to pack than cartons for road trips, because of the flexible packaging, and the bag is tough and doesn&#x27;t seem prone to popping open and spilling salt everywhere if it&#x27;s partially used.</li>
            <li> This is good epsom salt. Does what it is supposed to do. Nothing else too exciting about it. Size is good for the price.</li>
            <li> Just plain epsom salt. I can use this for plants, cleaning, bathing, etc and there are no extra scents or ingredients.</li>
            <li> There is no scientific evidence to support Epsom Salt relieving muscle pain or speeding healing. Before you buy, please read the full following articles:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RunnersConnect Website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are Epsom Salt Baths an Effective Treatment for Running Injuries? by John Davis&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Conclusion...Barring future research, it&#x27;s very hard to justify an Epsom salt bath over a traditional ice bath or hot water bath for treating an injury. Though Epsom salt is dirt-cheap, no research supports any direct effect on injury recovery, and none of the theories forwarded about how Epsom salt might help in indirect ways hold up to any scrutiny either.&amp;#34; -- John Davis&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PainScience Website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do Epsom Salts Work? by Paul Ingraham&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;My search for scientific evidence concerning Epsom salt baths was disappointing. I was unable to find even a single scientific paper studying their effect on body pain. Folk remedies are often generally neglected by researchers, but not usually so completely.&amp;#34; -- Paul Ingraham</li>
            <li> works well, especially for foot baths.</li>
            <li> does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating as it soothes pains and aches. I really liked that it was a big bag and that ill I had too do was click a few button and a few days later it is at my door step. I would recommend it to anybody who needs relief of pain and cant readily go to the store.</li>
            <li> Great service and just what we wanted.</li>
            <li> I used this in a bathsalts recipe and it worked very well.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping great product and I appreciate the easily resealable bag.</li>
            <li> I use this in a homemade product. Good quality and convient size.</li>
            <li> I suffer from horrible joint pain that creeps up in the evenings, I took a bath with this product and my pain subsided within a few minutes of soaking in the bath. The resealable package actually works too. I love this product!</li>
            <li> What can be said about epsom salt?  If you use it, this is a good one.  I soak nearly every day to relieve muscle tension and pain.</li>
            <li> Great for soaking feet or your whole body.  Salts dissolve quickly with no residue and make the water soft and soothing.  I also use them to make bath salts as gifts, adding my own scented oils and coloring.  An open container of scented bath salts is a nice fragrance for the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Bag came with a hole punched in it, and a box laced with salts.</li>
            <li> I love that this is a resealable bag. Epsom salt baths have been great for soothing sore muscles.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT. TRUTH IN ADVERTISING.</li>
            <li> Bought this to make homemade fizzy scented bath salts as Christmas gifts.  It worked perfectly.</li>
