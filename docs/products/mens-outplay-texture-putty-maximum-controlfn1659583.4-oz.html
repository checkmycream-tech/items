            <li>the perfect amount of hold with a matte finish.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>, it tends to fall), but this product is perfect.</li>
            <li>Great feel and smell!</li>
            <li>great price!  </li>
            <li>This is the best mens hair product out.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product, and keeps my hair looking great all day.</li>
            <li>Lasts forever, and ideal for medium-short curly hair.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, if you wear a ton of cologne and can mask the smell, it makes your hair look great.     </li>
            <li>This product is great.</li>
            <li>Works great and a great price</li>
            <li>but it gives a very nice shiny, but not waxy look to your hair.</li>
            <li>and although it held my hair good, it felt gooey.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Pretty great!  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, washes out easily and has a great hold with those &amp;#34;chunky separations&amp;#34; like it says on the tin.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve also noticed a TON more gray hairs since using this - to be fair</li>
            <li>It also washes off very very easily.</li>
            <li>But this is by far the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Gives the hair a nice texture and holds ok.</li>
            <li>and I can understand how someone might think it smells like diapers (not used, but that plastic &amp; baby powder smell is there very lightly).</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone with hair :)</li>
            <li>You really can restyle your hair during the day and still get a great look.  </li>
            <li>Second best putty ever!</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product many times, as I have been signed up for the subscribe and save option.</li>
            <li>smells more like chemically than fragrant, if that makes sense.  </li>
            <li>I was so glad when I found it on here and was able to save some money when I ordered it.</li>
            <li>My favorite hair product.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m sure some people can&#x27;t stand it, but i would give it a shot).</li>
            <li>them but nothing has been able to beat this redkin men product.</li>
            <li>It smells good and holds pretty well.</li>
            <li>My favorite &amp;#34;putty&amp;#34; because it is just the right consistency and has a nice matte finish</li>
            <li>Easy to style with fingers or a comb.  </li>
            <li>It washes off your fingers with water easily.</li>
            <li>Not supper stiff but great hold!</li>
            <li>that original tub was running out, I ordered one through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Hair looks clean, doesn&#x27;t feel like you have product in and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>not too shiny and just the right consistency!</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite hair product .</li>
            <li>I thought it was great; I was able to get a stylish look with a dry finish, which works well for me since my hair is thinning above my temples.  </li>
            <li>Not too expensive, good scent, and a great matte finish.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t look super shiny.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product for sure, just wish it had Prime shipping</li>
            <li>Best hair product out there for all day hold, not shiny, doesn&#x27;t make your hair hard, a more natural yet controlled look.</li>
            <li>i guess i could say that it does a good job pasting a faux-hawk to my cranium all day long.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t leave too much film on my girl&#x27;s hands when she rubs my head.</li>
            <li>Lightweight but good hold that you can brush through still, with minimal shine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and still leaves my hair fresh.  </li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite styling product.</li>
            <li>Redkin is the only hair product I liked.</li>
            <li>It does have a pretty good matte finish and the chunky separation claim is not far from truth.</li>
            <li>Does not get too greasy throughout the day, and washes right out.</li>
            <li>It just looks like my hair is standing, exactly as I wanted.</li>
            <li>Most likely I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li>Great product, arrived earlier than expected</li>
            <li>I love this product because it&#x27;s dry use and makes my hair look like it&#x27;s holding itself up.</li>
            <li>purely coincidental,</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m not so precise each day) but that is enough for the smell to linger.     </li>
            <li>this was not the real product.</li>
            <li>Works really well for men and women</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, not to heavy and priced right</li>
            <li>Has a &amp;#34;dry look&amp;#34; and looks more natural if applied to dry hair.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get past the smell of this though, the maneuvering wax is AMAZING smelling and this I just am not a fan of.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the extra bucks over the competitors</li>
            <li>It is a matte paste that is very thick yet goes on super easily and is NEVER stickey.</li>
            <li>Does have a little grease to it, but it is easy to wash out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little thicker, holds great and can be used in wet or dry hair.  </li>
            <li>Not glossy or fatty and is soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li>wow.  </li>
            <li>Not the real stuff leaves hair greasy not the same texture</li>
            <li>It is very convenient to have it delivered instead of having to find somewhere local that carries it.</li>
            <li>It leaves a fairly natural appearance to the hair, not greasy like a pomade at all.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have that white paste color of some other ones that is hard to get rid of, but the smell is not so good.</li>
            <li>The original tub had a thick, sticky consistency, but the new tub is almost like chocolate mousse.  </li>
            <li>I already use other Redken products, but in general I am not brand loyal and have tried different styling products (gels, wax, clay etc).</li>
            <li>And the weird part is when you move around, you can smell it on your own hair......</li>
            <li>Somewhat greasy in the hair but doesn&#x27;t provide any shine or chunky separation, so it&#x27;s kind of a fail for my hair.</li>
            <li>Product received looked like the real deal and probably was - except that the lot number and other markings on the bottom of the tub were removed.</li>
            <li>This is one of the few products that helps to keep my hair manageable and consistent.</li>
            <li>It might be that older containers develop the smell over time or other people are just far less sensitive.    </li>
            <li>The consistency is much different from the real stuff (as another reviewer also stated), and it didn&#x27;t even fill out the entire tub; it was as if it were diluted and then put back in with a canister that is a little smaller, leaving a gap between the tub edge and the end of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> The smell is strong enough and lingers long enough that I smell it at least a few times within the first few hours after application.</li>
            <li> I use a bit of this in my hair while wet, then comb, and after my hair is dry it looks natural and holds in place</li>
            <li> I have used hair wax for a long time and only use an amount equivalent to a dime or nickle</li>
            <li> works really well, very stiff styling product.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> , I have to agree with the other reviewers that I&#x27;m not sure this is the real thing.</li>
            <li> Other products make my hair turn out differently each day it seems.</li>
            <li> The consistency seemed a bit off and after about two weeks I started to notice little black spots developing on the stuff - looks like mold or some kind of weird chemical reaction.</li>
            <li> in dry hair, it doesn&#x27;t shine at all, which is somewhat desirable for some people.  </li>
            <li> It does smell (not very strongly, though), and the consistency is completely different.  </li>
            <li> (I know over priced, but I was curious what my barber would suggest).</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product because it is lightweight and gives his hair a styled look without it appearing to be wet.</li>
            <li> In wet hair, it tends to stay shiny looking.  </li>
            <li> He bought this at the salon&#x27;s all the time and spent a LOT of money on it.</li>
            <li> and I use this to get a somewhat messy look and to spike up the back.</li>
            <li> This putty works well on wet or damp hair.  </li>
            <li> Plus a little goes a long way.    </li>
            <li> It also provides just enough hold and never makes your hair hard and also never flakes when dry.</li>
            <li> This is the product I usually buy from the local hair place and it was about a buck or two cheaper on Amazon</li>
            <li> I was concerned with the possibility that it may be a knock off, due to other reviews; however, have seen no signs of that being the case.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen other reviews where they thought it was a knock off.  </li>
            <li> I tried lots of other products that were inferior, but cheaper and they couldn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> , my life is crazy stressful right now so that could also be to blame, but who knows?</li>
            <li> It does have a slight smell to it</li>
            <li> This is a quality product for much much less than what you&#x27;ll find at your salon.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;m tossing it and will go back to buying it locally.</li>
            <li> surface of the it also has a weird texture, and it&#x27;s very obvious that it has been opened and exposed to the air for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;BUT</li>
            <li> I wanted a putty that wouldn&#x27;t look heavy or have a shine, and that is what I get with this.</li>
            <li> When I opened the product, there was dust all over it and even a few eyelashes.....</li>
            <li> I have been using this hair product for a few years.</li>
            <li> I need hairspray to hold the messy look up (if not</li>
            <li> This reduces the chance you&#x27;ll have some shade of green in a spot you can&#x27;t see</li>
            <li> I usually get the maneuvering wax but somehow ordered this.  </li>
            <li> Calls to question the origins of the product, to me at least.</li>
            <li> and by bad, i mean like 3-day old diapers.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the $1 or $2 savings for what seems to be of questionable quality.&lt;br /&gt;Probably</li>
            <li> This is not a good product.</li>
            <li> and it is just not good.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and this doesn&#x27;t make it look oily.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product from Amazon when I saw it for around six bucks, but was skeptical.</li>
            <li> and by smells, i mean smells bad.  </li>
            <li> It is not the worst either</li>

            <li> works really well, very stiff styling product.</li>
            <li> By design this product is not perfumed.  I&#x27;ve used it for a year or so and never noticed any smell. I put forward that you sir are in fact the one who smells.</li>
            <li> wow.  what can i say about this stuff.  i guess i could say that it does a good job pasting a faux-hawk to my cranium all day long.  i could say that it works well when you apply it.  i could also say that it has the color of a forrest mushroom after you step on it while hiking.  i could say all those things, but instead i&#x27;ll say that this product smells.  and by smells, i mean smells bad.  and by bad, i mean like 3-day old diapers.    i recently wore this product in my hair while out on the town in the company of a lady.  things were going well and i was totally about to get like infinity kisses but all of a sudden she was like, \\&quot;hey do you smell that?  Whats that smell??\\&quot; and i was like \\&quot;no, i don&#x27;t smell anything\\&quot; but i did smell something and it was my hair.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, and keeps my hair looking great all day. The guy below who said that it smells is mistaken. It isn&#x27;t the product that smells - It&#x27;s you! Highly recommend this product for sure, just wish it had Prime shipping</li>
            <li> I picked up a container of this at my hair salon (I know over priced, but I was curious what my barber would suggest). It does have a slight smell to it and I can understand how someone might think it smells like diapers (not used, but that plastic &amp; baby powder smell is there very lightly). It might be that older containers develop the smell over time or other people are just far less sensitive.    The smell is strong enough and lingers long enough that I smell it at least a few times within the first few hours after application. I have used hair wax for a long time and only use an amount equivalent to a dime or nickle (I&#x27;m not so precise each day) but that is enough for the smell to linger.     On the plus side, if you wear a ton of cologne and can mask the smell, it makes your hair look great.     For myself, I will have to find something else.</li>
            <li> Recommended to me by my hairdresser. Lasts forever, and ideal for medium-short curly hair.</li>
            <li> Product received looked like the real deal and probably was - except that the lot number and other markings on the bottom of the tub were removed. Why was that done? Calls to question the origins of the product, to me at least. I may have saved a bit but I ended up going back to the B&amp;M store for this to avoid any problems with the product.</li>
            <li> Why buy at Salon prices when you don&#x27;t have to? This is a quality product for much much less than what you&#x27;ll find at your salon.</li>
            <li> Not the real stuff leaves hair greasy not the same texture</li>
            <li> I already use other Redken products, but in general I am not brand loyal and have tried different styling products (gels, wax, clay etc). But this is by far the best I have ever used. Hair looks clean, doesn&#x27;t feel like you have product in and lasts all day. Plus a little goes a long way.    I would recommend this to anyone with hair :)</li>
            <li> No label on product, I have been using this stuff for years, when I got this, no label and different texture, I feel I was scammed.... this was not the real product.</li>
            <li> There are no printed expiration date on the box</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy, washes out easily and has a great hold with those &amp;#34;chunky separations&amp;#34; like it says on the tin.  You really can restyle your hair during the day and still get a great look.  I&#x27;ve even gotten up a number of times in the morning and didn&#x27;t have to re-style or wash my hair.</li>
            <li> Not glossy or fatty and is soft and easy to use. Gives the hair a nice texture and holds ok.</li>
            <li> Pretty great!  Second best putty ever!</li>
            <li> This is the product I usually buy from the local hair place and it was about a buck or two cheaper on Amazon so I gave it a shot, I have to agree with the other reviewers that I&#x27;m not sure this is the real thing. The consistency seemed a bit off and after about two weeks I started to notice little black spots developing on the stuff - looks like mold or some kind of weird chemical reaction. Needless to say, I&#x27;m tossing it and will go back to buying it locally. It&#x27;s not worth the $1 or $2 savings for what seems to be of questionable quality.&lt;br /&gt;Probably purely coincidental, but I&#x27;ve also noticed a TON more gray hairs since using this - to be fair, my life is crazy stressful right now so that could also be to blame, but who knows?</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite hair product . Well worth the extra bucks over the competitors</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product many times, as I have been signed up for the subscribe and save option. I was concerned with the possibility that it may be a knock off, due to other reviews; however, have seen no signs of that being the case. My husband loves this product because it is lightweight and gives his hair a styled look without it appearing to be wet. It is very convenient to have it delivered instead of having to find somewhere local that carries it.</li>
            <li> I wanted a putty that wouldn&#x27;t look heavy or have a shine, and that is what I get with this. Lightweight but good hold that you can brush through still, with minimal shine.</li>
            <li> It smells good and holds pretty well. Has a &amp;#34;dry look&amp;#34; and looks more natural if applied to dry hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this on accident.  I usually get the maneuvering wax but somehow ordered this.  It&#x27;s a little thicker, holds great and can be used in wet or dry hair.  in dry hair, it doesn&#x27;t shine at all, which is somewhat desirable for some people.  In wet hair, it tends to stay shiny looking.  I can&#x27;t get past the smell of this though, the maneuvering wax is AMAZING smelling and this I just am not a fan of.  smells more like chemically than fragrant, if that makes sense.  And the weird part is when you move around, you can smell it on your own hair......</li>
            <li> This is not a good product. They sent it to me by mistake, I needed the Redken Maneuver Wax. I tried using this and it is just not good.</li>
            <li> Hold is so, so but it gives a very nice shiny, but not waxy look to your hair.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve been using in my hair.  It&#x27;s not greasy and still leaves my hair fresh.  My stylist gave me something else and although it held my hair good, it felt gooey.  This does not leave your hair gooey.  I&#x27;ve seen other reviews where they thought it was a knock off.  I was buying mine at a salon until I started getting it from amazon.  I can&#x27;t tell the difference. It looks, feels, and holds the same.  In my opinion, what I&#x27;ve received the last 3 times seems legit.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! the perfect amount of hold with a matte finish.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a stylist, so I bought a tub.  I thought it was great; I was able to get a stylish look with a dry finish, which works well for me since my hair is thinning above my temples.  And no - it didn&#x27;t smell.  5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When that original tub was running out, I ordered one through Amazon.  It&#x27;s almost like a different product.  It does smell (not very strongly, though), and the consistency is completely different.  The original tub had a thick, sticky consistency, but the new tub is almost like chocolate mousse.  It even works differently in my hair.  3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Works really well for men and women</li>
            <li> Not too expensive, good scent, and a great matte finish. Does not get too greasy throughout the day, and washes right out.</li>
            <li> My fiance only uses Redken Men Outplay Putty for his hair. He bought this at the salon&#x27;s all the time and spent a LOT of money on it. I was so glad when I found it on here and was able to save some money when I ordered it. He says it has the same quality as the salon&#x27;s! I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite styling product. I tried lots of other products that were inferior, but cheaper and they couldn&#x27;t cut it. Redkin is the only hair product I liked.</li>
            <li> Works well. I have thin hair and this doesn&#x27;t make it look oily. It just looks like my hair is standing, exactly as I wanted.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few products that helps to keep my hair manageable and consistent. Other products make my hair turn out differently each day it seems. Does have a little grease to it, but it is easy to wash out.</li>
            <li> My favorite &amp;#34;putty&amp;#34; because it is just the right consistency and has a nice matte finish so you don&#x27;t look super shiny. Keeps your hair shaped without giving you that crispy hair look.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it&#x27;s dry use and makes my hair look like it&#x27;s holding itself up. It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t leave too much film on my girl&#x27;s hands when she rubs my head. Put it on your head and tell your girl to rub it. I&#x27;m telling you!</li>
            <li> Great product, arrived earlier than expected</li>
            <li> My favorite hair product. Not supper stiff but great hold!</li>
            <li> This product is great. It is a matte paste that is very thick yet goes on super easily and is NEVER stickey. It also washes off very very easily. It also provides just enough hold and never makes your hair hard and also never flakes when dry.</li>
            <li> Works great and a great price</li>
            <li> In terms of consistency and texturing it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve had. It does have a pretty good matte finish and the chunky separation claim is not far from truth. It doesn&#x27;t have that white paste color of some other ones that is hard to get rid of, but the smell is not so good. It is not the worst either (I&#x27;m sure some people can&#x27;t stand it, but i would give it a shot). Most likely I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, not to heavy and priced right</li>
            <li> When I opened the product, there was dust all over it and even a few eyelashes.....gross...&lt;br /&gt;The surface of the it also has a weird texture, and it&#x27;s very obvious that it has been opened and exposed to the air for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;BUT i need to use it like now...so dang it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this hair product for a few years. I have a pixie cut and I use this to get a somewhat messy look and to spike up the back. I need hairspray to hold the messy look up (if not, it tends to fall), but this product is perfect.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years, purchased from salons for about $15.  I ordered this product from Amazon when I saw it for around six bucks, but was skeptical. Sure enough, this looks to be a fake. The consistency is much different from the real stuff (as another reviewer also stated), and it didn&#x27;t even fill out the entire tub; it was as if it were diluted and then put back in with a canister that is a little smaller, leaving a gap between the tub edge and the end of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would stay away from this counterfeit item.</li>
            <li> Great feel and smell!</li>
            <li> great price!  delivered on time</li>
            <li> I would recommend heating it up with a blow drier before applying it to semi-dry hair.  This reduces the chance you&#x27;ll have some shade of green in a spot you can&#x27;t see and it also leaves the hair in place but still allows you to run your fingers through it for seduction purposes.</li>
            <li> I use a bit of this in my hair while wet, then comb, and after my hair is dry it looks natural and holds in place well. I have been using this again and again for several years now.</li>
            <li> Wife has to have it to do her hair. Has used for years. Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This is the best mens hair product out. I still like to try others now and them but nothing has been able to beat this redkin men product. I have an amazon subscription for it!</li>
            <li> Its oily or something.  It left oil marks on my pillow.</li>
            <li> This putty works well on wet or damp hair.  Easy to style with fingers or a comb.  It leaves a fairly natural appearance to the hair, not greasy like a pomade at all.  It washes off your fingers with water easily.</li>
            <li> Somewhat greasy in the hair but doesn&#x27;t provide any shine or chunky separation, so it&#x27;s kind of a fail for my hair.</li>
            <li> used this stuff for years.  not too shiny and just the right consistency!</li>
            <li> Best hair product out there for all day hold, not shiny, doesn&#x27;t make your hair hard, a more natural yet controlled look. I have short hair.</li>
