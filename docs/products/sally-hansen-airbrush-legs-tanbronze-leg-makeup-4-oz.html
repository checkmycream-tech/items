            <li>Great product goes on smoothly and  and is not messy also has more of a natural tan than the spray.</li>

            <li>It gives you a natural look without the orangey color so many self tanners leave you with!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve snapped up as much in the Tan/Bronze color as I have been able to find and pray they will never stop making this product.</li>
            <li>My skin is very fair and this bronzer gave my legs a natural, sheer look.  </li>
            <li>, that were quickly &amp;#34;dulled&amp;#34;, by this combination of colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will keep using it, and thank you for the quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Overall, pretty good product for my needs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really nice glow for the middle of this raging, snowy, winter!</li>
            <li>I found that mixing with a body lotion gave a more natural look and easier to blend.</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and all other products make me turn orange</li>
            <li>Goes on easy and looks natural.  </li>
            <li>It is more like an overall color for people to use who don&#x27;t have something to cover up.</li>
            <li>I have to make sure to put my glasses on &amp; have a good light when I apply it, or I wind up with weird looking streaks on the back of my legs..!</li>
            <li>It took  a couple of uses, to learn just how much to apply.</li>
            <li>so I was very hesitant about buying this product.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t transfer as much as the spray-on&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>The product is very thick but massages into your skin quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>I was expecting this make up to cover some light spots and dark veins on the front of my legs</li>
            <li>I have used only Sally Hansen Spray-on products until now.(The pinkish tones of other brands are not what i&#x27;m looking for).This &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; version gives reasonable coverage,goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>It washes off very easily from your hands which is a big plus - no more tanner under your nails or on the sides of your hands.</li>
            <li>It makes the tan really &amp;#34;true&amp;#34;, and it lasts longer as long as you shower, and do not scrub your legs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>legs were super pale and I have some sun spots</li>
            <li>but now that I am in my late 40&#x27;s, my skin is just not as smooth as it once was.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is messy, no matter what I do, but it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the spray airbrush legs by  Sally Hansen previously but would much rather use the lotion.  </li>

            <li> So, that being said, I hate to wear shorts or skirts because of my very light skin.</li>
            <li> It might work for some people but it&#x27;s way too dark for me.</li>
            <li> My only problem was when I crossed my legs it rubbed off on the outside of my capris and left a weird spot for the rest of the day!</li>
            <li> This went on so solid that blending was tough.</li>
            <li> but it was messy to use.</li>
            <li> I put it on and it was a dark ORANGE not a nice tan as it look like on the bottle.</li>
            <li> Then I reach for this bad boy - now always at the ready in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I usually use a self-tanner</li>
            <li> I am very pale.</li>
            <li> it comes off with soap and water and no matter how hard I tried it did not come off.</li>
            <li> The lotion is very thick though, so I mix in it with some moisturizer and lather it over my legs.</li>
            <li> I added it to some Victoria&#x27;s Secret self tanner, like someone else wrote to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hate that part of this, you just have to be careful.</li>
            <li> or I just look dirty</li>
            <li> This looks very fake when you put it on.</li>

            <li> I love the outdoors and I love a nice tan...but now that I am in my late 40&#x27;s, my skin is just not as smooth as it once was.  I&#x27;ve used the Spray on \\&quot;Airbrush Legs\\&quot; for years, but it was messy to use. The new cream is AMAZING!  I breeze to put on - without streaking - the color is gorgeous and my legs are smooth and flawless.  I&#x27;ve snapped up as much in the Tan/Bronze color as I have been able to find and pray they will never stop making this product.</li>
            <li> I added it to some Victoria&#x27;s Secret self tanner, like someone else wrote to do.&lt;br /&gt;It is waaaaay better when you do this. It makes the tan really &amp;#34;true&amp;#34;, and it lasts longer as long as you shower, and do not scrub your legs.&lt;br /&gt;I wore some long pj bottoms for an hour so it would not rub off  on the furniture.&lt;br /&gt;My legs were super pale and I have some sun spots, that were quickly &amp;#34;dulled&amp;#34;, by this combination of colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really nice glow for the middle of this raging, snowy, winter!</li>
            <li> I like it better than tanning.  Easy, stays on, looks natural, love it!  I would not buy anything else ever.</li>
            <li> This is the best ever!  Goes on easy and looks natural.  I wear disposable latex gloves when I put it on so I don&#x27;t have tanned palms. If I miss a spot it is easy to correct.  Stays on and does&#x27;t come off till I shave my legs!  I have pale legs and this products gives me a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> It took  a couple of uses, to learn just how much to apply.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because my legs do not tan and self tanners do my work on me. I am very pale. I used this and loved it at first. But shortly after wearing it, if became very splotchy and it looked weird. I tried applying it both with a mit and wit my hands. Both were a bust. :/</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and all other products make me turn orange or I just look dirty, I use this as face make up because it  blends well and is waterproof!</li>
            <li> I am allergic to self-tanners so I was very hesitant about buying this product. I am so glad I did. This product gives me the same look as a self tanner but no bad smell, in fact no smell at all, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about splotches or streaks that self tanners leave if you don&#x27;t apply perfectly. The product is very thick but massages into your skin quickly and easily. Since the product is colored, you can see where you are applying. It washes off very easily from your hands which is a big plus - no more tanner under your nails or on the sides of your hands. This product stays on all day and only comes off when you bathe or shower. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I was expecting this make up to cover some light spots and dark veins on the front of my legs but it didn&#x27;t.  It is more like an overall color for people to use who don&#x27;t have something to cover up.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I am a very fair skinned woman. So, that being said, I hate to wear shorts or skirts because of my very light skin. This product has changed all that!! It gives you a natural look without the orangey color so many self tanners leave you with! My only complaint is that if you wear white shorts or capris it will wear off on you clothing. It does wash out so it hasn&#x27;t ruined anything, so that&#x27;s good. My only problem was when I crossed my legs it rubbed off on the outside of my capris and left a weird spot for the rest of the day! I hate that part of this, you just have to be careful. Hope this review has helped!</li>
            <li> I do recommend this product to several of my friends and family members. The lotion gives your skin a silky looking tan without sparkles or the smell of a tanning salon.</li>
            <li> loving it, it stays on and it looks perfect on my legs and chest, it has been my secret for pre season</li>
            <li> nice product, good delivery time nice quality</li>
            <li> Great product goes on smoothly and  and is not messy also has more of a natural tan than the spray. I will keep using it, and thank you for the quick delivery. apologies for the rating delay.</li>
            <li> Not as good as in aersol can</li>
            <li> I have used only Sally Hansen Spray-on products until now.(The pinkish tones of other brands are not what i&#x27;m looking for).This &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; version gives reasonable coverage,goes on smoothly. Looks a bit dryer than the spray-on version,but has&lt;br /&gt;the same color: more on the &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34; side, which works for me. Doesn&#x27;t transfer as much as the spray-on&lt;br /&gt;but you do get some transfer. Overall, pretty good product for my needs.</li>
            <li> satisfied with product</li>
            <li> My skin is very fair and this bronzer gave my legs a natural, sheer look.  I would highly recommend this product when you need tan  sexy legs!  Stays on well and doesn&#x27;t come off until you shower.  I&#x27;ve used the spray airbrush legs by  Sally Hansen previously but would much rather use the lotion.  Better control when applying to legs and no need to worry about the spray hitting the carpet.</li>
            <li> Covered my veins and saved the day for me!</li>
            <li> This is as fantastic as everyone says it is.  I usually use a self-tanner but sometimes I don&#x27;t have time OR I don&#x27;t want to smell like a vegetable oil fryer.  Then I reach for this bad boy - now always at the ready in my bathroom.  In just a couple of minutes, I have beautiful legs ready for the world.  GREAT coverage and NO SMELL.  I dance and sweat in this stuff and it doesn&#x27;t come off on me or my clothing.  You need to wash with soap in the shower to get it off.  This is just amazing and you won&#x27;t believe how good your legs look.  GET THIS!!!</li>
            <li> I like this product that&#x27;s why I decide too buy..its help my skin..I even use when me and my husband going too Vegas...its really nice..</li>
            <li> This looks very fake when you put it on. It looks like what they use at a mortuary. And it does rub off onto clothes and light colored furniture fabrics.</li>
            <li> This went on so solid that blending was tough. I found that mixing with a body lotion gave a more natural look and easier to blend.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, my legs look photoshopped and flawless with this bronzer. The lotion is very thick though, so I mix in it with some moisturizer and lather it over my legs. I heard you can use it for your entire body, but I have never tried it. Also, it does leave residue on your clothes ever so slightly, so white is definitely out of the question!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this but the product was ORANGE. I put it on and it was a dark ORANGE not a nice tan as it look like on the bottle. I decided to shower since it sas it comes off with soap and water and no matter how hard I tried it did not come off. dissapointed.</li>
            <li> It might work for some people but it&#x27;s way too dark for me.</li>
            <li> Makes legs look tanner and hides imperfections.</li>
            <li> In winter my legs get really dry and although I am not white my legs get white with no sun.  I bought this leg makeup and I can&#x27;t believer how well it covered the dryness. No orange color.  My legs look great! I&#x27;m Mexican-American and the tan was the perfect color for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff is messy, no matter what I do, but it works pretty well. I have to make sure to put my glasses on &amp; have a good light when I apply it, or I wind up with weird looking streaks on the back of my legs..! Someone mentioned using hand lotion with it. Think I&#x27;ll try that next time!</li>
