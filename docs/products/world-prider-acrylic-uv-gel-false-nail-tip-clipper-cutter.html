            <li>Okay let me start by saying this product cuts the time it takes to do acrylic nails!</li>

            <li>I started doing my own nails at home.</li>
            <li>Started doing my own Gel nails.</li>
            <li>BUT THEY R NICE</li>
            <li>I bought this nail clipper because I do my own acrylic nails</li>
            <li>I use it when I do my own acrylic nails and even when I get them done</li>

            <li>but im still satisfied with how it works</li>
            <li>It could be oiled a bit better to be smoother.  </li>
            <li>My dog clippers do a better job then this piece of metal.</li>
            <li>WILL LOVE THEM…</li>

            <li>I purchased two of these as stocking stuffers and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t buy more.</li>
            <li>like I said you get what you pay for if you want something better look somewhere alse</li>
            <li>Cute clippers.</li>
            <li>Everywhere I have seen these they cost $10 or more</li>
            <li>That would be ok</li>
            <li>More like dog claw clippers.</li>
            <li>In school learning Acrylic nails,fits my budget,light weight easy to handle,wish I had purchased more than one,It gets the job done</li>
            <li>I love the color and they are easy to hold, just hope they are easy to use.</li>
            <li>and she thought it was cool!</li>
            <li>but they work like a charm, and so easy to handle</li>
            <li>This is the FIRST TIME that I&#x27;ve done my own Gel nails and tips.</li>
            <li>works just fine.</li>
            <li>feels kinda cheap but gets the job done.</li>
            <li>and it was cheap.</li>
            <li>works great have had them for several years already</li>
            <li>Cheaply made and shipping took foreverrrrrrrrrrr</li>
            <li>Looks cheap but man</li>
            <li>cheap qulity</li>
            <li>Its kindof cheap</li>
            <li>part is too tin and looks cheap</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t even able to use this item becuase it broke right away.  </li>
            <li>so you have to make sure your holding it in the right position.</li>
            <li>Came in fast !!!</li>
            <li>Super easy to use.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m pretty sure in the picture</li>
            <li>So satisfied it&#x27;s exactly as described</li>
            <li>Was nervous at first, but these cutters worked EXACTLY HOW I&#x27;D HOPED, and it was a piece of cake!!!</li>
            <li>It does make a clean cut.</li>
            <li>I have a handy fiancee that fixed it!</li>
            <li>I wish it had more curve, but it does the job really well</li>
            <li>Sturdy and not so good it broke at the second use, now is gone gone to trash , oh well</li>
            <li>You once again get what you pay for i will use it gently though because others are more than triple the price</li>
            <li>you get what u pay for not bad</li>
            <li>I have had a different one and it was hard to squeeze this one works awesome and get a nice clean cut</li>
            <li>Broke the very first time I used them.</li>
            <li>Cheap thing broke first time I used it</li>
            <li>Not even worth one star</li>
            <li>It is worth the price.</li>
            <li>early I thought it was going to take forever like most stuff from overseas</li>
            <li>/&gt;Defiantly worth the 2.00$</li>
            <li>The only thing is that some times my nails come out kind of lopsided</li>
            <li>works as expected, good value</li>
            <li>It came pretty quickly considering it came from Hong Kong</li>
            <li>Their sharp they cut good</li>
            <li>it  doesn&#x27;t cut right Thenail</li>
            <li>I was very careful and they worked amazingly good.</li>
            <li>I love the pink handles, they work just fine.  </li>
            <li>First time trying to use them they feel apart</li>
            <li>its tricky at first</li>
            <li>Broke the first time i used it.</li>
            <li>Broke the first Time I used it.</li>
            <li>I love it definitely helps a lot!!</li>
            <li>and I could have found a better one at the local WalMart!</li>
            <li>Broke after first try.</li>
            <li>I dont know why exactly</li>
            <li>Perfect for false tips and acrylic nails!</li>
            <li>Nice and sharp.  </li>
            <li>They got here very quickly, but were red.</li>
            <li>but this certainly wasn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made they look used not what I expected</li>
            <li>nice pink color !!!</li>
            <li>fast delivery</li>
            <li>Really regret waisting money on this.</li>
            <li>Work very well.</li>
            <li>You need to be a bit gentle with it</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very flimsy, to the point that i threw it away..</li>
            <li>and I came a whole week</li>
            <li>But that basically operates the whole tool</li>
            <li>This nail clipper is good but didn&#x27;t come Pink, instead it came red</li>
            <li>I love the quality, highly durable and sharp.</li>
            <li>Spend a little bit more money and purchase the stainless steel one from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.</li>
            <li>The blades are dull, the hinges are rickety and despite the bright shiny appearance portrayed in the picture the metal is so old and worn it looks almost rusted.&lt;br</li>
            <li>One this particular item</li>
            <li>Although this tool can be useful for many things, it does not cut round tips like it was said to do, only straight.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t initially impressed with the look, since I ordered a pink clipper and it came in a dull red, but it does get the job done.</li>
            <li>But overall, they are pretty decent clippers.  </li>
            <li>I live in the US</li>
            <li>But the complete opposite,  the pink on the handles was more of a light pink but still</li>
            <li>they are very cheaply made but what can you except when you pay hardly any thing for them..</li>
            <li>Was expecting them to be super cheap and broken if anything.  </li>
            <li>It does the job, but feels a little cheap in the hand.  </li>
            <li>but my 18 yr old son needed to clip his nails</li>
            <li>and it made it so much easier to do than with regular nail clippers</li>
            <li>Spend the $15-$20 to buy a solid stainless steel one Because this one is defective</li>
            <li>Wrong color but who cares, works well and good price</li>
            <li>they work perfectly do exactly what i expected</li>
            <li>It has been so useful at quickly and efficiently cutting tips and saves me so much time.</li>
            <li>I messaged the seller and I very politely mentioned that I thought they came in pink.</li>
            <li>I mean its cheap...</li>
            <li>Once i finally got it I was so excited until i realized that it was too small to clip my thumb nails.  </li>
            <li>Came early a week early than expected.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying I was a little scared of them at first</li>
            <li>And they were red, not pink!</li>
            <li>but otherwise works fine with false nail bits.</li>
            <li>They told me to keep the ones I had and they are shipping me a new pair or these clippers in pink!</li>

            <li> It is worth the price.</li>
            <li> early I thought it was going to take forever like most stuff from overseas</li>
            <li> /&gt;Defiantly worth the 2.00$</li>
            <li> The only thing is that some times my nails come out kind of lopsided</li>
            <li> works as expected, good value</li>
            <li> It came pretty quickly considering it came from Hong Kong</li>
            <li> Their sharp they cut good</li>
            <li> it  doesn&#x27;t cut right Thenail</li>
            <li> I was very careful and they worked amazingly good.</li>
            <li> I love the pink handles, they work just fine.  </li>
            <li> First time trying to use them they feel apart</li>
            <li> its tricky at first</li>
            <li> Broke the first time i used it.</li>
            <li> Broke the first Time I used it.</li>
            <li> I love it definitely helps a lot!!</li>
            <li> and I could have found a better one at the local WalMart!</li>
            <li> Broke after first try.</li>
            <li> I dont know why exactly</li>
            <li> Perfect for false tips and acrylic nails!</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp.  </li>
            <li> They got here very quickly, but were red.</li>
            <li> but this certainly wasn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made they look used not what I expected</li>
            <li> nice pink color !!!</li>
            <li> fast delivery</li>
            <li> Really regret waisting money on this.</li>
            <li> Work very well.</li>
            <li> You need to be a bit gentle with it</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very flimsy, to the point that i threw it away..</li>
            <li> and I came a whole week</li>
            <li> But that basically operates the whole tool</li>
            <li> This nail clipper is good but didn&#x27;t come Pink, instead it came red</li>
            <li> I love the quality, highly durable and sharp.</li>
            <li> Spend a little bit more money and purchase the stainless steel one from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.</li>
            <li> The blades are dull, the hinges are rickety and despite the bright shiny appearance portrayed in the picture the metal is so old and worn it looks almost rusted.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One this particular item</li>
            <li> Although this tool can be useful for many things, it does not cut round tips like it was said to do, only straight.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t initially impressed with the look, since I ordered a pink clipper and it came in a dull red, but it does get the job done.</li>
            <li> But overall, they are pretty decent clippers.  </li>
            <li> I live in the US</li>
            <li> But the complete opposite,  the pink on the handles was more of a light pink but still</li>
            <li> they are very cheaply made but what can you except when you pay hardly any thing for them..</li>
            <li> Was expecting them to be super cheap and broken if anything.  </li>
            <li> It does the job, but feels a little cheap in the hand.  </li>
            <li> but my 18 yr old son needed to clip his nails</li>
            <li> and it made it so much easier to do than with regular nail clippers</li>
            <li> Spend the $15-$20 to buy a solid stainless steel one Because this one is defective</li>
            <li> Wrong color but who cares, works well and good price</li>
            <li> they work perfectly do exactly what i expected</li>
            <li> It has been so useful at quickly and efficiently cutting tips and saves me so much time.</li>
            <li> I messaged the seller and I very politely mentioned that I thought they came in pink.</li>
            <li> I mean its cheap...</li>
            <li> Once i finally got it I was so excited until i realized that it was too small to clip my thumb nails.  </li>
            <li> Came early a week early than expected.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I was a little scared of them at first</li>
            <li> And they were red, not pink!</li>
            <li> but otherwise works fine with false nail bits.</li>
            <li> They told me to keep the ones I had and they are shipping me a new pair or these clippers in pink!</li>
            <li> I got ones in red even though they show as pink but its not a big deal</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually not that harsh when I review something</li>
            <li> they are pink, but I got red ones.</li>
            <li> i received a red one instead of pink; &amp;it isn&#x27;t made well</li>
            <li> Does the job the only thing is the color is way off its hospital pink.</li>
            <li> and they start to grow out too long.</li>
            <li> Wish I would of spent the extra money to get one that would of lasted me longer.</li>
            <li> I guess Waited a long time to get it &amp; it doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Center arm bracket is too big &amp; loose</li>
            <li> It is red and it is a little smaller than the ones they have in the salon.</li>
            <li> It was all that it said it would be and met all my expectations and even came earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> I wrote the seller telling them I was kind of disappointed because I assumed they would be pink.</li>
            <li> works but have to tighten up because it came  loose and the pink handle</li>
            <li> but I did not get what I expected.</li>
            <li> And the answer I got was: &amp;#34;No there red.&amp;#34; then after I mentioned that in the picture they were pink</li>
            <li> Color Wasn&#x27;t Pink Tho</li>
            <li> Came wayyyy before the expected date.</li>
            <li> Waste of money even though it was only $2</li>
            <li> I ordered these because I wanted a pink pair.</li>
            <li> Was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t work well since other reviews said it was cheap</li>
            <li> Not a good look for me being a professional</li>
            <li> Sharp too, have done my nails as well as my roommates.</li>
            <li> I bought these on August 14 and they just arrived today, so while the shipping felt like it took a while compared to other products I&#x27;ve purchased on Amazon that took like 2 months these weren&#x27;t too shabby.</li>
            <li> I was so worried itd be too big or small</li>
            <li> Other than that I like it</li>
            <li> You can can the whole nail at once instead of cutting one side and then the other like I had to with regular nail cutters.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous little tool and I am sad that I didn&#x27;t get one years ago!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I expected for $2</li>
            <li> I was a little worried, I used to get my nails done all the time, but in college I can&#x27;t afford to.</li>
            <li> WAS A LITTLE SCARED</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Does not fit plastic tips or any nail.</li>
            <li> and i was tired of using the file to shave them down when they grew out too long.  </li>
            <li> Very little pressure needed.</li>
            <li> So if it fails later, I will update the rating.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I looked back at the description and they didn&#x27;t say the colors were random.</li>
            <li> This machine is dirty and old why they didn&#x27;t said it was used tomorrow</li>
            <li> apart from the fact that it took over 4 weeks, when i opened the package, not only was it broken but it noticed its was used!</li>
            <li> It is now pointless to use.</li>
            <li> When u squeeze the handles together they are a little shaky but they do cut the tip.</li>
            <li> This clipper makes cutting false nails so much easier.</li>
            <li> the blade seems very lose like it might fall out when cutting the nail i wouldnt buy this product!</li>
            <li> Hard to cut nails with..</li>
            <li> but it is so hard to squeeze the handles together now to cut the nail tips.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used this yet, arrived late.</li>
            <li> but if you have gel or thick nail products on your nails, buy a sturdier one.</li>
            <li> Its weakly made and just doesnt cut it.</li>
            <li> If I could give it no stars I would, received package very late and broken.</li>
            <li> but my item was broken.</li>
            <li> Were broken...</li>
            <li> Unsatisfied with the product, received it broken.</li>
            <li> It was broken upon arrival.  </li>
            <li> IT WAS BROKEN WHEN I GOT IT AND LOOKED USED DONT BUY</li>
            <li> It was broken when I received it.</li>
            <li> they said they come at random.</li>
            <li> You can cut a fake nail thats not on your finger</li>
            <li> but it came and someone screwed it on wrong</li>
            <li> Failed and then broke on me.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with the cutters because they broke shortly after I got them and was cutting tips on my client.</li>
            <li> not sure if i got a bad one or if they are all like this!</li>
            <li> I received this item broken :(</li>
            <li> Horrible they are dull bend the tips.</li>
            <li> it was that bad</li>
            <li> It still does but not as bad.</li>
            <li> so disappointed..</li>
            <li> I hate to give you one star</li>
            <li> worst product ever!</li>
            <li> Horrible nail clipper.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS TERRIBLE</li>
            <li> This is an horrible product made.</li>

            <li> feels kinda cheap but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> First time trying to use them they feel apart</li>
            <li> works just fine. and it was cheap.</li>
            <li> works great have had them for several years already</li>
            <li> it was a gift she loves it.</li>
            <li> It does the job, but feels a little cheap in the hand.  It does make a clean cut. I have only used it 3 times.  So if it fails later, I will update the rating.</li>
            <li> I hate to give you one star but my item was broken. And not working properly</li>
            <li> It was great quality.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Great product, Thank you</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I was a little scared of them at first but my 18 yr old son needed to clip his nails so he volunteered to let me try them out on him. I was very careful and they worked amazingly good.</li>
            <li> I am using this clipper to make my acrylic nails. I am very happy with this tool.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.  Nice and sharp.  Use them for acrylic nails and they give a good clean cut.  Very little pressure needed.</li>
            <li> *sigh* I&#x27;m usually not that harsh when I review something but I did not get what I expected. :/ The clippers were wobbly as if they were not made correctly; I felt like they were going to brake. And I&#x27;m pretty sure in the picture they are pink, but I got red ones. I looked back at the description and they didn&#x27;t say the colors were random. I ordered these for the color. I messaged the seller and I very politely mentioned that I thought they came in pink. And the answer I got was: &amp;#34;No there red.&amp;#34; then after I mentioned that in the picture they were pink they said they come at random. ummm ok.&lt;br /&gt;So would I recommend: No I wouldn&#x27;t, and I will make sure I don&#x27;t buy from these people again.</li>
            <li> I wish it had more curve, but it does the job really well</li>
            <li> Works great! Good buy!</li>
            <li> Its great. Color Wasn&#x27;t Pink Tho It Was Red...</li>
            <li> this is awesome to use! its tricky at first but after you try it , it does a great job. fast delivery</li>
            <li> I love these nail clippers. I got ones in red even though they show as pink but its not a big deal the only problem i have is that they seem to cut at an angle!</li>
            <li> Broke the very first time I used them.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t even able to use this item becuase it broke right away.  Really regret waisting money on this.</li>
            <li> Seems well made, cuts like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> I ordered this maybe two weeks ago and I was supposed to be getting it next month or so and its already here and works wonderfully</li>
            <li> Broke the first time i used it. Spend a little bit more money and purchase the stainless steel one from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply. Not even worth one star</li>
            <li> Cheaply made and shipping took foreverrrrrrrrrrr omg</li>
            <li> I received this item broken :(</li>
            <li> Just like the salon uses. I started doing my own nails at home. This tool is a must have. It&#x27;s not the best quality but it&#x27;s a great price for what you are getting. I&#x27;m very happy</li>
            <li> The tips cut is good and the delivery was excellente</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous little tool and I am sad that I didn&#x27;t get one years ago! It has been so useful at quickly and efficiently cutting tips and saves me so much time. Love it.</li>
            <li> Were broken... And they were red, not pink!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t initially impressed with the look, since I ordered a pink clipper and it came in a dull red, but it does get the job done. All in all it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> they work perfectly do exactly what i expected</li>
            <li> As soon as I got it I took it out of the package and tried to clip an acrylic nail it broke</li>
            <li> Works GREAT!!! Started doing my own Gel nails. Glued my glitter tips on, used this tip cutter, and it worked PERFECTLY!!! This is the FIRST TIME that I&#x27;ve done my own Gel nails and tips. Was nervous at first, but these cutters worked EXACTLY HOW I&#x27;D HOPED, and it was a piece of cake!!! Didn&#x27;t have any problems with this cutter at all!!! When the time comes, I WILL DEFINATELY BUY THIS AGAIN!!!! THANK YOU!!!</li>
            <li> Este cortador e duro para usar, faz um barulho como se estivesse enferrujado, quebra as tips quando vai cortar, ou corta totalmente torto. Não valeu a pena. Era melhor pagar mais caro em um melhor. Agora o barato vai sair caro, pois tenho que comprar outro.</li>
            <li> Came early a week early than expected. It is red and it is a little smaller than the ones they have in the salon. It works great!</li>
            <li> I love this item. Im able to cut my tips perfectly</li>
            <li> Works great. In great condition no complaints</li>
            <li> It looked used with scratches and finger prints already on them. Very cheaply made. Hard to cut nails with.. I like the color though.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried, I used to get my nails done all the time, but in college I can&#x27;t afford to. These work like a charm! Sharp too, have done my nails as well as my roommates.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done for the price. Broke the first Time I used it. Good thing I have a handy fiancee that fixed it!</li>
            <li> Came wayyyy before the expected date. Was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t work well since other reviews said it was cheap but I think it&#x27;s great for the price</li>
            <li> Although this tool can be useful for many things, it does not cut round tips like it was said to do, only straight.</li>
            <li> Unsatisfied with the product, received it broken. Waste of money even though it was only $2</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t  work , I use  only  one  time  and  this product broke. 😠</li>
            <li> I ordered these because I wanted a pink pair. They got here very quickly, but were red. I wrote the seller telling them I was kind of disappointed because I assumed they would be pink. They told me to keep the ones I had and they are shipping me a new pair or these clippers in pink!</li>
            <li> Great item, it makes it so much easier  to cut and shape my nails. Should have bought these years ago</li>
            <li> This nail clipper is good but didn&#x27;t come Pink, instead it came red but im still satisfied with how it works</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t put it through an intensive session, but it seems to work just the way it should. It could be oiled a bit better to be smoother.  Still, it&#x27;s WAY cheaper than the ones at Sally&#x27;s and works just as well.</li>
            <li> Threw it away it was that bad</li>
            <li> My dog clippers do a better job then this piece of metal. Its weakly made and just doesnt cut it.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and not so good it broke at the second use, now is gone gone to trash , oh well</li>
            <li> Perfect for false tips and acrylic nails!</li>
            <li> Work very well. I would definitely buy again if I ever needed to.</li>
            <li> daughter age 11 loves it</li>
            <li> This clipper may not be the best one but it is good for a beginner or someone who just want to buy all the instruments to try acrylic nails at home. It is worth the price. You need to be a bit gentle with it but otherwise works fine with false nail bits.</li>
            <li> This works like a dream.. Glad I found it and purchased it!!! I had been looking in local retail stores but all I could find were the ones for cuticles..</li>
            <li> Nice quality and very easy to use</li>
            <li> I really like this its very strong and cuts very nice.</li>
            <li> This clipper makes cutting false nails so much easier. You can can the whole nail at once instead of cutting one side and then the other like I had to with regular nail cutters. Super easy to use.</li>
            <li> THESE R VERY NICE CLIPPERS….LOVE THE COLOR….AND THEY HANDLE WELL….U WILL LOVE THEM…WAS A LITTLE SCARED THEY WOULDN&#x27;T BE GOOD QUALITY BUT THEY R NICE</li>
            <li> i received a red one instead of pink; &amp;it isn&#x27;t made well, it&#x27;s very flimsy, to the point that i threw it away.. not sure if i got a bad one or if they are all like this!</li>
            <li> Just started using this product.  Works the way I wanted it to, will purchase again if it ever breaks.</li>
            <li> Use this everytime I do my nails and it works great!</li>
            <li> Whats to say, they speak for themselves.  I love the pink handles, they work just fine.  No complaints here.</li>
            <li> Looks cheap but man this does the job.</li>
            <li> It came pretty quickly considering it came from Hong Kong I live in the US and I came a whole week early I thought it was going to take forever like most stuff from overseas but its nice and its good quality I just finish doing my friends nails and she loves them and it made it so much easier to do than with regular nail clippers will be purchasing again if needed</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I received two of  these! I love the quality, highly durable and sharp.</li>
            <li> Great! It clips the nails very easily!</li>
            <li> works great !!! nice pink color !!! Came in fast !!!</li>
            <li> Their sharp they cut good</li>
            <li> Does the job the only thing is the color is way off its hospital pink.</li>
            <li> you get what u pay for not bad&lt;br /&gt;a cheap qulity but get the job done. arrived before date</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made.  It was broken upon arrival.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I love it definitely helps a lot!!</li>
            <li> works, the cheapest I could find, if you find cheaper let me know jk jk jk jk jk jk jk</li>
            <li> I bought these on August 14 and they just arrived today, so while the shipping felt like it took a while compared to other products I&#x27;ve purchased on Amazon that took like 2 months these weren&#x27;t too shabby. And they worked impeccably, Did the job and cut through the nails like butter. Was expecting them to be super cheap and broken if anything.  But the complete opposite,  the pink on the handles was more of a light pink but still good.&lt;br /&gt;Defiantly worth the 2.00$</li>
            <li> very happy this works great I have had a different one and it was hard to squeeze this one works awesome and get a nice clean cut</li>
            <li> Its kindof cheap and I could have found a better one at the local WalMart!</li>
            <li> I orderd this for my wife on the 16th of october and we just now got them in the mail november 6th!! so it took FOREVER to recive these almost wanted to just get my money back beacuse we didnt think that they where ever going to show up! they are very cheaply made but what can you except when you pay hardly any thing for them.. the blade seems very lose like it might fall out when cutting the nail i wouldnt buy this product! oh and it ships from some where in hongkong and they dont list that any where on the site so if you want to buy these after reading this review then except it to take forever!</li>

            <li> Wrong color but who cares, works well and good price</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made they look used not what I expected</li>
            <li> I bought this nail clipper because I do my own acrylic nails and i was tired of using the file to shave them down when they grew out too long.  Once i finally got it I was so excited until i realized that it was too small to clip my thumb nails.  But overall, they are pretty decent clippers.  I would reccommend them to friends/family.</li>
            <li> Doors what it&#x27;s supposed to</li>
            <li> If I could give it no stars I would, received package very late and broken.</li>
            <li> Broke after first try. You can cut a fake nail thats not on your finger but if you have gel or thick nail products on your nails, buy a sturdier one.</li>
            <li> Very durable, and looks great with the rest of my nail supplies. Makes a nice crisp cut, perfect!</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these as stocking stuffers and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t buy more. The blades are dull, the hinges are rickety and despite the bright shiny appearance portrayed in the picture the metal is so old and worn it looks almost rusted.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m not sure what I expected for $2 but this certainly wasn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> Just got this item aswell as the 500 nails and they work perfectly on them! I was so worried itd be too big or small but they work like a charm, and so easy to handle and the color is amazing! love it!!</li>
            <li> So satisfied it&#x27;s exactly as described</li>
            <li> Love these, they get the job done and are awesome for the price !</li>
            <li> Okay let me start by saying this product cuts the time it takes to do acrylic nails! There is practicly no file shaping if used properly! These work great for beginners. They arrived in perfect condition &amp; with easy instructions.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the chance to use them yet. I have not yet gotten the nails to put on to try them on as of yet.</li>
            <li> worst product ever! apart from the fact that it took over 4 weeks, when i opened the package, not only was it broken but it noticed its was used! i couldn&#x27;t even open and close the clipper! so disappointed..</li>
            <li> Works great! I use it when I do my own acrylic nails and even when I get them done and they start to grow out too long.</li>
            <li> it  doesn&#x27;t cut right Thenail</li>
            <li> I only used it once then 3 days later It mysteriously broke. Horrible nail clipper.</li>
            <li> One this particular item u get wat u pay for it works but have to tighten up because it came  loose and the pink handle part is too tin and looks cheap like I said you get what you pay for if you want something better look somewhere alse</li>
            <li> Cute clippers. I haven&#x27;t used them yet so I only gave 3 stars.</li>
            <li> This is a good cuter but it came and someone screwed it on wrong so it&#x27;s crooked. But it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> I like it. The only thing is that some times my nails come out kind of lopsided so you have to make sure your holding it in the right position. Other than that I like it</li>
            <li> You once again get what you pay for i will use it gently though because others are more than triple the price</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used this yet, arrived late. Well update after use. They came in great condition though. I love the color and they are easy to hold, just hope they are easy to use.</li>
            <li> I do my own nails. I do not do anyone else&#x27;s nails so this product does not get used often. I dont know why exactly but it is so hard to squeeze the handles together now to cut the nail tips. It is now pointless to use. Wish I would of spent the extra money to get one that would of lasted me longer. I have had this product for a year and I have used it once a month.</li>
            <li> When u squeeze the handles together they are a little shaky but they do cut the tip.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS TERRIBLE IT WAS BROKEN WHEN I GOT IT AND LOOKED USED DONT BUY</li>
            <li> Everywhere I have seen these they cost $10 or more so this was a great deal</li>
            <li> Horrible they are dull bend the tips. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> If I could give it 0 stars I would. It was broken when I received it.</li>
            <li> On the cheaper side when it comes to the quality but still does the job. I use it for my acrylic and gel nails. I mean its cheap...what do you expect.</li>
            <li> Tried to cut about 4 nails... Failed and then broke on me. Trash.</li>
            <li> works as expected, good value</li>
            <li> When I got it it seemed like it had oil or something greasy on it. It still does but not as bad. I like it though.</li>
            <li> It was all that it said it would be and met all my expectations and even came earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> It does what is supposed to do</li>
            <li> Cheap thing broke first time I used it</li>
            <li> In school learning Acrylic nails,fits my budget,light weight easy to handle,wish I had purchased more than one,It gets the job done</li>
            <li> Center arm bracket is too big &amp; loose That would be ok But that basically operates the whole tool and it is so lose u cannot use it Get what u pay for I guess Waited a long time to get it &amp; it doesn&#x27;t work Spend the $15-$20 to buy a solid stainless steel one Because this one is defective</li>
            <li> Not sturdy enough but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Very happy it cuts a nice straight nail which is what I had been fighting with,with the nail file I&#x27;m just waiting for my drill to come in to actolly use it.</li>
            <li> This is an horrible product made. I broke in 1 day. Will not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> It was a gift and she thought it was cool!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with the cutters because they broke shortly after I got them and was cutting tips on my client. Not a good look for me being a professional</li>
            <li> Does not fit plastic tips or any nail. More like dog claw clippers.</li>
