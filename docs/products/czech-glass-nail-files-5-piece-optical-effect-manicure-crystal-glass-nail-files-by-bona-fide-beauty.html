            <li>Nail Files with Manicure Stick provided for free by Bona Fide Beauty in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li>I came to love it</li>

            <li>They come in a velvety protective case that will keep them safe in my pocket book.  </li>
            <li>I have a feeling I will be buying more to give as gifts.</li>
            <li>I love the sturdiness too.</li>
            <li>Better than diamond files; who would have guessed?  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even begin how to explain how much I am in love with these</li>
            <li>and I love them will buy more.</li>
            <li>price was great , got it in 2 days  FAST , item was even better as described</li>
            <li>I received this product at a discounted price or free, in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>The seller is great to work with too; I contacted them immediately for a defect issue (chip), and they were super quick to replace it.</li>
            <li>Very worth it!</li>
            <li>These files are as effective as the first one I bought and are prettier.  </li>
            <li>I am leaving these on my vanity next to all my beautiful makeup because they match everything!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The glass is manufactured in The Czech Republic from Genuine Czech glass which hello...</li>
            <li>I was buying the cheap ones and then throwing them away because I was TERRIFIED of getting another infection.</li>
            <li>Such a great 5 piece manicure set.</li>
            <li>I was DELIGHTED to find this set on Amazon, and loved the first set so much that I bought a second set immediately.</li>
            <li>Just wipe them clean with an alcohol pad or cotton ball dipped in alcohol</li>
            <li>so I can use it to clean under my nails.</li>
            <li>Each color is vibrant and can stand alone in its own right.</li>
            <li>This Product IS TRUE TO WHAT THEY SAY!&lt;br /&gt;Not an Imitation.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>The  manicure stick is sweet.</li>
            <li>It comes with 4 colorful glass nail files with sleeves and a free manicure set.</li>
            <li>These are not only cute but work real good filing down nails to shape.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>and I was able to file them quicker than I would have with traditional nail files.  </li>
            <li>The blue manicure stick has glass on either end which makes it priceless compared to the wooden sticks of the same kind.&lt;br</li>
            <li>WILL LAST ME MANY YEARS...</li>
            <li>They are easy to clean, just run it under a little water too.</li>
            <li>The bonus skinny blue file is wonderful for pushing back and removal cuticle skin, as well as filing and smoothing those tiny areas that regular size files can&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li>They file much faster and smoother than the paper style files.  </li>
            <li>When done, a quick rinse leaves them ready for the next use.</li>
            <li>I can understand why these files were rated so highly.  </li>
            <li>I bought a cheap version in a discount dept. store that was dull the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>For the fashionistas, you have 4 colorful options: red, blue, gold, and silver.</li>
            <li>so much I started trying to find something similar at local beauty salon supply houses.</li>
            <li>And the product description says: Regular, long-term use on the natural nail can contribute to overall nail health &amp; strength.</li>
            <li>The little blue file is well worth the extra price of buying Czech glass nail and foot files!!</li>
            <li>nail files are less than 5.5\\&quot; in length and very sturdy.</li>

            <li> Great Glass Nail Files Set, and the bonus Manicure Stick is a nice addition!  The colors are beautiful and 4 is the perfect number to give you options to have a glass file just about everywhere...home, purse, work, and car.&lt;br /&gt;  Filing my nails with the glass nails left my nails smoother and I was able to file them quicker than I would have with traditional nail files.  I also like that the glass files are made of tempered glass, so they are non porous, which means they are not holding on to the bacteria from the last time you filed your nails.  Just wipe them clean with an alcohol pad or cotton ball dipped in alcohol and you are good to go.  Can&#x27;t do that with traditional nail files.&lt;br /&gt;  The manicure stick is a nice addition and is also made of tempered glass.  One end comes to a point, while the other end is rounded.  Perfect for pushing back cuticles and cleaning under and around nails.&lt;br /&gt;  This is a wonderful set for yourself or can be given as a gift.  It can even be broken up into several gifts as an addition to gift baskets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glass Nail Files with Manicure Stick provided for free by Bona Fide Beauty in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:7cde0879e811ea7cf7a69ce585db47cb]]I had never tried glass nail files before. It was always the flimsy silver ones. These blew me away. One thing to keep in mind is that these nail files are sharp. I was curious as to how sharp and decided to try to \\&quot;cut\\&quot; a few objects. Let me just advise that you keep these nail files in their protective velvet carriers when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Visually the nail files are extremely pleasing. For the fashionistas, you have 4 colorful options: red, blue, gold, and silver. Each color is vibrant and can stand alone in its own right. The blue manicure stick has glass on either end which makes it priceless compared to the wooden sticks of the same kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nail files are less than 5.5\\&quot; in length and very sturdy. This set takes nail care to the next level....at least for me it does having never used glass before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product sent by Bona Fide Beauty for review</li>
            <li> I never knew glass nail files existed until I found one that someone had lost, with no way to return it to the owner. I came to love it so much I started trying to find something similar at local beauty salon supply houses. Those products were either inferior and one-sided, extremely pricey, or both. I was DELIGHTED to find this set on Amazon, and loved the first set so much that I bought a second set immediately. The manicure stick is the best I&#x27;ve ever found, and I now have enough sturdy two-sided glass files of both quality and beauty that I can scatter them around where I need them most -- and they&#x27;re gorgeous, besides! Strongly recommended!!! I may have to place an order for a third set so I&#x27;ll be stocked for life, LOL.</li>
            <li> These Czech glass nail files are THE best files on the market!! It&#x27;s amazing how much better they file and smooth your nail edges without causing any peeling or splintering. Everyone who&#x27;s used mine has purchased their own! The bonus skinny blue file is wonderful for pushing back and removal cuticle skin, as well as filing and smoothing those tiny areas that regular size files can&#x27;t reach. The little blue file is well worth the extra price of buying Czech glass nail and foot files!!</li>
            <li> This Product IS TRUE TO WHAT THEY SAY!&lt;br /&gt;Not an Imitation.&lt;br /&gt;Very Pleased with this bundle!!!</li>
            <li> I read reviews on items I purchase and was impressed by the  number of positive reviews for these nail files.  I can understand why these files were rated so highly.  They do a great job shaping my nails leaving the edges smooth.  I bought a glass file while on vacation in Sedona, AZ and loved it.

            <li> Good and timely service. Product as described.</li>
            <li> WHAT CAN I SAY..AWESOME..DOES A GOOD JOB...WILL LAST ME MANY YEARS...</li>
            <li> The colors of these are amazing. I love the sturdiness too. Everyone keeps asking me if they break, and I haven&#x27;t had one do that yet. They are easy to clean, just run it under a little water too. The seller is great to work with too; I contacted them immediately for a defect issue (chip), and they were super quick to replace it. The coolest part abt the multi color pack is you can match your file to match your outfit!&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve never owned a glass nail file before, you should definitely try out these. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This is a lovely set of glass files which are excellent quality. I also like the extra stick that came in a tube for protection. This is an excellent set at a very good price. I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for thin glass nail files  that was not so thick so I can use it to clean under my nails. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. I will order more for friends and family! The  manicure stick is sweet.</li>
            <li> They are just as described.  They file much faster and smoother than the paper style files.  When done, a quick rinse leaves them ready for the next use.</li>
            <li> Great item, They came as promised and made great mothers day gifts. I would recommend this item and seller.</li>
            <li> Better than diamond files; who would have guessed?  Gentler on my nails but just as effective.  These are great!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even begin how to explain how much I am in love with these files!&lt;br /&gt;They are BEYOND beautiful, they are beyond magnificent and i just can&#x27;t even stand the thought of sharing these. In FACT!!! I am leaving these on my vanity next to all my beautiful makeup because they match everything!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Classy and elegant are the perfect 2 words to BEGIN describing these files. The glass is manufactured in The Czech Republic from Genuine Czech glass which hello... YES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a REALLY bad manicure at a salon a while ago and have been SUPER paranoid about the files I had been using. I was buying the cheap ones and then throwing them away because I was TERRIFIED of getting another infection. The product description says they are hygienic: their non-porous glass surface prevents the growth of unhealthy bacteria &amp; fungus. Will I EVER get a nasty and embarrasing infection? NOOOOOOO!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These glass ones??? Oh my gooooosh, I can  file my nails with a lighter touch, go in any direction without damaging my  nails. And the product description says: Regular, long-term use on the natural nail can contribute to overall nail health &amp; strength. Why would I ever EVER use any other file??? The pictures don&#x27;t even do this set of files any kind of justice!&lt;br /&gt;I recieved these files at a discounted rate for an honest opinion. My honest opinion is that these are the BEST nail files EVER.</li>
            <li> I never had a glass nail file till a friend gave me one for Christmas and I love them will buy more. I have gone through so many nail files,these are great</li>
            <li> price was great , got it in 2 days  FAST , item was even better as described</li>
            <li> Love these!! Very worth it!</li>
            <li> Such a great 5 piece manicure set. It comes with 4 colorful glass nail files with sleeves and a free manicure set. These are not only cute but work real good filing down nails to shape. Can be a great gift for anyone. These aren&#x27;t just any ordinary nail files they definitely stand out. I received this product at a discounted price or free, in exchange for my honest review.</li>
