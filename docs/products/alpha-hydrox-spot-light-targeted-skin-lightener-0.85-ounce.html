            <li>Great texture, and works well with my skin.</li>
            <li>At any rate, I&#x27;m a happy camper.  </li>
            <li>Even though I must say this line has got great products like their glycolic line, at great prices, this somehow just does not work for me.</li>
            <li>great price for a great product, speedy delivery, no problems.</li>
            <li>We have been using this product for a while with great results.  </li>
            <li>And then great results at 2 months.</li>
            <li>After my skin became used to the product, I have never again experienced the redness.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>If I can sigificantly reduce the discoloration I will be happy.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>This stuff, as you&#x27;ve probably read, is amazing!</li>
            <li>but I want everyone to know how amazing this stuff is!</li>
            <li>Thrilled that the spots are getting lighter!  </li>
            <li>I believe one more tube will make them dissapear for good!!!!!</li>
            <li>Plus, the box was appropriately packaged and in perfect condition - nice job!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so happy that this product works so good</li>
            <li>Loved this product it works great</li>
            <li>I will be sure to reorder this wonderful cream from Deparfumes web site.  </li>
            <li>Smell is not so pleasant, but you get used to it.</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews and bought this product thinking it was the best of what was available over the counter.  </li>
            <li>Really good product.  </li>
            <li>Good thing though...</li>
            <li>it works and it smells nice; also it is a great alternative to</li>
            <li>Alpha Hydrox Spot Light is the best value out there for my needs; I just wish I&#x27;d found it ages ago.</li>
            <li>Prompt delivery and good price.</li>
            <li>Did not work as good as I thought it would, but will keep using,&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s fair for me to pass any sort of judgement on it.  </li>
            <li>for the price this is good.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin with some sensitivity issues.</li>
            <li>so I would not put it on either AM or PM and use a good lotion instead.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice product at a great price, it does lighten spots, just do not expect that to happen overnight, give it a couple of weeks</li>
            <li>it is wise to read the directions and use according to those instructions.</li>
            <li>Effect can also, is the smell is not so good</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>However, the price is great so again its ok.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased that I purchased this product instead</li>
            <li>After doing some research and checking product ingredients, efficacy, pricing, and paula&#x27;s choice best reviews this was the best, most cost effective and high producing results product I found and am definitely thrilled I bought it.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>and I love it!  </li>
            <li>Cheap too!!</li>
            <li>I love this cream!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended this product to many people, it&#x27;s a steal!</li>
            <li>An amazing product for an amazing price.</li>
            <li>I decided to write a review because I want the world to know that this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>no results, i didnt want to put it all over my face for fear it might cause  some kind of skin problem (redness/peeling)  </li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t sing the praise of this stuff any better, it works, damn good.  </li>
            <li>Ordered two more so why stop a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Im really thrilled that they make this cream</li>
            <li>What kind of results did you get?</li>
            <li>And if you use this product, you MUST wear sunscreen or you will be doing more damage than good.</li>
            <li>Another plus about this cream is no irritation of any kind.</li>
            <li>I was recommended this brand, and I&#x27;m thrilled to have found it.  </li>
            <li>Smells very strong</li>
            <li>Maybe its more effective on lighter skinned persons.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best product I have tried.</li>
            <li>Alpha Hydrox Spot Light Targeted Skin Lightener and Porcelana seemed to have good reviews</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really strong and works very fast!!!!</li>
            <li>For those who experienced a redness in the spot area in the beginning, I experienced the same but persevered and the redness eventually faded.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I guess the price was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>At this point, additional applications hurt a bit more so what I did was apply skin moisturizer on top.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I love Alpha Hydroxy brand.  </li>
            <li>the shipping cost more than the product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Like so many products, it&#x27;s trial and error.</li>
            <li>i will have to give it more time.</li>
            <li>(Mostly, like have to put my face 3 inches from the mirror to see any discoloration)  </li>
            <li>But be sure to use sunscreen when you are in the sun afterwards.</li>
            <li>I cant stop using thiis stuff..clears up my skin so its more of an even tone.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d never get rid of it, after trying so many products.</li>
            <li>but this product is much better.</li>
            <li>This brought even better results.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased to say that this product is working so well for me.</li>
            <li>Then it peeled off and the spot magically went with it.</li>
            <li>My esthetician advised to never to use this for more than a 30 day stretch</li>
            <li>maybe for someone else it works better</li>
            <li>I am going to order three more tubes.</li>
            <li>know it gets better later).That cream</li>
            <li>and Ive just ordered 3 more.  </li>
            <li>most people expect a magic product that works over night but this has worked okay for the price and time.</li>
            <li>Better prices here.</li>
            <li>A lot better.</li>
            <li>I had wanted to use it on a crop of freckles on my nose that were cute when I was 12, but now they just look like smudges of dirt.  </li>
            <li>I should have tried more to use it.</li>
            <li>:) I found this product after searching through http://www.paulaschoice.com/beautypedia/</li>
            <li>and I love this product.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product mostly on my nose because it&#x27;s not shielded when I wear sunglasses.  </li>
            <li>I have always love alpha hydroxy products.</li>
            <li>I FIGURED IT WOULD BE JUST ONE MORE TUBE</li>
            <li>I love this cream</li>
            <li>I guess more feminine.</li>
            <li>I expect as time goes on that they will fade even more.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not quite sure if it works or not.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I had some marks left from acne on my chest and they weren&#x27;t very attractive.</li>
            <li>Better products available that do work!  </li>
            <li>Our dermatologist recommended it once it was safe to use on my daughter&#x27;s skin.&lt;br /&gt;A note about hydroquinone....</li>
            <li>I wish for a magic potion to remove them all together...</li>
            <li>so I ended up spending way more</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve even been able to stop using my deordorant.</li>
            <li>Better than the $100+ bottle.  </li>
            <li>Not terrible</li>
            <li>will recommend to a friend and buy another tube:)</li>
            <li>My skin looks more even toned.</li>
            <li>Hydroquinone is, for the most part, a safe product.</li>
            <li>No product containing hydroquinone should ever be used in combination with any form of peroxide including benzoyl peroxide meaning most acne medications should not be used along with it.</li>
            <li>I purchased it to treat the age spots on the top of my hands.</li>
            <li>This is a light weight lotion with 2% hydroquinone plus 10% Glycolic adic at a ph of 3.3 which makes the product effective.  </li>
            <li>I have heard that putting on a good moisturizer first would help.  </li>
            <li>and my darks spots were significantly lighter!</li>
            <li>and I can already tell a significant difference!</li>
            <li>I use other products by this brand and love them, but this one really impressed me!</li>
            <li>Do better with any cheap product over the counter</li>
            <li>But on the newer age spots, it was incredible, especially for the price!  </li>
            <li>I started looking into laser therapy and was becoming hopeless.</li>
            <li>I did not hesitate to try this as their products have always been effective and economical.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product on the top of my hands for just 2 weeks and am very pleased with the results so far!!!  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply on your skin.</li>
            <li>In my case the lotion has done a lot more harm than good; I&#x27;m surprised it&#x27;s sold over the counter.</li>
            <li>Super age-spot lightener, very light and no signature hydroquinone odor.  </li>
            <li>If you can stand the stinky smell on your hands and area that you cover with Alpha Hydrox, then the product is fine.</li>
            <li>This product is good, but seems to be a bit strong for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The smell is fine and the texture is light and almost gel like</li>
            <li>However after 3 applications I noticed a huge improvement to my noticeably darkening freckles.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a week and can already see a huge improvement in my sun spots.  </li>
            <li>I get compliments on my flawless skin almost everyday.</li>
            <li>It really helps the skin to lighten&lt;br /&gt;evenly and nicely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely thrilled at how fast this is working.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m light - med combination skin</li>
            <li>I was watching Dr. Oz and they talk about alpha hydrox spot light.</li>
            <li>/decrease my use of foundation, which I used to primarily cover blemishes.</li>
            <li>AND...its damn cheap.  </li>
            <li>So happy, my confidence is back through the roof.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Alpha Hydrox Spot Light Targeted Skin Lightener for a month.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s most definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li>No further comments as I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, it is cheap</li>
            <li>I used this Alpha Hydrox Spot Light for 3 weeks and got my desired result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is cheap too.</li>
            <li>My brown spots are now a light brown and are continuing to fade.</li>
            <li>(I did \\&quot;free</li>
            <li>A pleasing light scent.</li>
            <li>I did some research on amazon.com and found their Product, Spot Light.</li>
            <li>2% is the strongest dose available without a prescription.</li>
            <li>Alpha Hydrox Spot Light Targeted Skin Lightener is a cost-effective lightener.</li>
            <li>Spot Light Skin Lightner Fade Cream :  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on about my seventh day, and so far so good.  </li>
            <li>I am thrilled and can&#x27;t wait to see how it will look in a few more weeks!!</li>
            <li>and I already noticed a huge change, I originally got it for acne scars on 2 areas of my face</li>
            <li>Works fairly well on spots and has lightened many of my targeted hyperpigmented areas, though some not completely.</li>
            <li>I bought this based on the positive reviews, and all I can say is that I&#x27;m glad it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited</li>
            <li>I cannot tell yet if the spots will become significantly lighter or not.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re still there, and I&#x27;m sure it will take time for it to heal completely, but so far the results are great.</li>
            <li>Thanks! : )</li>
            <li>but I have to say that it was so worth it!</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more very soon !</li>
            <li>Ok, first I stand by Alpha Hydrox products and I also stand by this one.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled that such an inexpensive cream is so effective and so FAST!</li>
            <li>Well, I guess going from brown spots to bright red is a bit lighter.  </li>
            <li>similar ones that are not as good.</li>
            <li>I ordered it that day to see how good it was for only $10.00.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use much of this cream so why not be safe rather than sorry?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good stuff, you definitely have to keep at it though.  </li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t expecting to get it for a full week).</li>
            <li>been using for 4 weeks 15 reduction ..will keep at it for the full 12 weeks</li>
            <li>But the spots that are darker than others on my face havent really changed..unless it takes more time.</li>
            <li>I will give it the full trial and see what happens.</li>
            <li>Just since purchasing a month ago, my age spots under my eyes are gone, I&#x27;m still working on the ones on my upper lip but they have been there longer and are more abundant and dominant, so make sure you catch those age spots early!</li>
            <li>THANKS FROM A REAL PERSON IN FLORIDA!!!!</li>
            <li>The hydroquinone and 10% glycolic acid formula in Spot Light is right on the money.</li>
            <li>As of yesterday, I noticed that one other freckle has gotten DARKER, and the rest of my spots have experienced no change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was going to buy souffle but picked this up instead as it was on super saver shipping.</li>
            <li>For a decade, I&#x27;ve been plagued with mild acne since I was a teenager</li>
            <li>After about 10 days, one spot looked as if I&#x27;d mildly burned myself with a curling iron.</li>
            <li>I now have mild acne</li>
            <li>It really works great, especially under my arms.</li>
            <li>and I saw results quickly</li>
            <li>Great product - does work in lightening the dark spots on my face.  </li>
            <li>Great for dark SPOTS ♡♡♡</li>
            <li>it is great on my dark spots that I got on my leg</li>
            <li>Worked and works great on my dark spots.  </li>
            <li>I applied it 4 times on my hand and in 1 days it started to peel with bright clear new skin underneath!</li>
            <li>AHA 10% in this product is high for those who are not used to it and who may have sensitive or fair skin.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t have much smell and isn&#x27;t greasy like others.</li>
            <li>I swear within the first week I saw a noticeable difference!  </li>
            <li>This works fast!!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell great and feels a little greasy.</li>
            <li>Got it real fast.  </li>
            <li>For the price, it might be worth it.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll try a more natural product.</li>
            <li>The cheaper stuff (Porcelana) with hydroquinone worked far better for me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>My skin texture has gone through an unremarkable change as well, more like the covered skin under my shirt, soft and glowing.</li>
            <li>Ive tried many products to try and clear it</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s worth it for me.</li>
            <li>So far, I am pleased.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and was concerned this would burn, but only experienced the slightest amount of tingle right after applying it.</li>
            <li>But take note, this product does have 2% hydroquinone, which is known for lightening up dark spots quickly, but also is known for causing cancers, So make a wise decision on using this product.</li>
            <li>If you have tried other products by this excellent brand (such as the Soufflé cream), you will know what to expect.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with her noticing the significant change from my last visit.</li>
            <li>but I had to apply it twice per day, generously right on the spot.</li>
            <li>I started using right away .</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>I switched to prescription TriLuma and that worked almost right away.</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t advise using it right before you want to go out.</li>
            <li>Started using it right away, within 2 weeks I could see a difference.</li>
            <li>The price was right</li>
            <li>this has worked great on my dark spots and really evened out my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>So I found this product and got it mainly because it was cheap, hoping it would help.</li>
            <li>This product works fine, I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This stuff is very strong and will actually burn your skin if you overuse.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure everyone reacts in their own unique way, but considering I expected little to begin with, I&#x27;m satisfied with these preliminary results.</li>
            <li>Since it seems to be effective and quite quick, I want to be careful not to bleach my skin.</li>
            <li>and I noticed something kind of strange happening.</li>
            <li>Good product to fade dark spots/melasma</li>
            <li>I have dark patches on my fair skin, immediately under my ears.  </li>
            <li>The first week one of my freckles loosened up and peeled right off</li>
            <li>(I have fair, relatively sensitive asian skin).  </li>
            <li>But is is really smooth and makes my skin soft!</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I have only used it two more times this week and after a few days it started to peel all on its own!</li>
            <li>And I have a very light, Irish complexion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i love this product, i have used so many different products for my dark spots but nothing worked as good as this, especially since im in Afghanistan and the weather and water does not help.</li>
            <li>When you first use it, you may feel and see no result.</li>
            <li>Make sure if you are in the sun that you use sunscreen or the spots come back.</li>
            <li>Order came when it should and order is exactly what and</li>
            <li>(like I did the first time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been religious about using it twice a day, but use it twice a day on most days.  </li>
            <li>but this is the first time I ever tried using any AHA&#x27;s let alone Hydroquinone on my hands.  </li>
            <li>You have to use this consistently for it to work.  </li>
            <li>This year I got my first age spot on my face.  </li>
            <li>With only using it for three weeks, my skin is better and the brown spots are just going away.</li>
            <li>In time, you&#x27;ll be amazed when you discover a spot has pretty much disappeared!  </li>
            <li>The price of this product made me skeptical, but I was so happy with it!  </li>
            <li>If you decide to use, test it first before diving head-first.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>You will likely peel a bit - this is NORMAL for this kind of product.  </li>
            <li>FOR REAL!</li>
            <li>I think the prescription strengths would work better (obviously), but this one works alright.</li>
            <li>so this product will probably last around 3 - 6 months depending on how many places you use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this brand of foot cream with no ill effects.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I will buy a second tube soon:)</li>
            <li>I feel like it was working the first two weeks</li>
            <li>My daughter mentioned it recently which prompted me to research which products had the most chance of working.</li>
            <li>Most people living now would not be aware if they have this allergy and might have a cross reaction to this</li>
            <li>Overall, I was pleased with the product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>It stings a bit at first, but did not break my face out.</li>
            <li>When i first got this product i put it on at night n</li>
            <li>Both spots have significantly lightened and one is almost gone completely.</li>
            <li>The spot has turned from light brown to light pink.  </li>
            <li>Only used it for a week when my skin started to become bright red with irritation.  </li>
            <li>If you want fast results, make sure to use it twice daily.</li>
            <li>I am delighted with the results as larger, darker spots are fading, and the smaller lighter ones have gone!!!&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>then I  developed more of those lovely spots on my face and grew impatient and tried prescription Retin-A cream.  </li>
            <li>After the first day, my skin reacted by hyper-secreting oils, and the whole areas where I applied the product looked darker, like I had been under the sun tanning.</li>
            <li>The two largest spots on my face which I named archipelago and figure-eight because this is exactly what they looked like; have faded so much that I can now see my face, where before I did not see &#x27;the forest for the trees&#x27; - meaning when I looked at myself in a mirror</li>
            <li>Just as good, if not better than obagi.</li>
            <li>(I recommend applying sparingly on clean, dry skin right after cleansing--just right on the spots), and applied just moisturizer and sunscreen during the day, as I believe exposing your skin to sunrays with the product on your face causes hyper-pigmentation of the skin.    </li>
            <li>and I am amazed at how fast and effective the results are on my dark skin.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m certain that by 4 weeks</li>
            <li>It was so large people sometimes asked me if it was a birth mark.  </li>
            <li>I am an esthetician and just started getting some hyper-pigmentation in certain areas, I have never used hydro-quinine and was always a bit apprehensive.</li>
            <li>So far I have some of the same issues that others have experienced, such as stinging, dry flaking skin on spots treated and some spots becoming darker.  </li>
            <li>I even had some new scars that faded and are practically invisible now after just 3 days!!</li>
            <li>I never expected this cream to make such a difference but am happy to say that the skin is looking overall smoother and clearer.  </li>
            <li>I have had this darned brown spot on my face for a few years, and nothing screams ol&#x27; lady more than that!  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product it works very well with the other Alpha products.&lt;br /&gt;I will write back later with full results of skin discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;Quick fast shipment and great customer service.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to use regularly but can certainly tell a difference after the few days to a week that I was able to apply it.  </li>
            <li>I had been using 10% Alpha hydrox cream for a few weeks and wasnt happy with the initial condition of my skin(I</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really do the job but with this price, I can&#x27;t expect too much.  </li>
            <li>Within a week age spots on face and hands were much lighter.  </li>
            <li>It could VERY well just be my skin</li>
            <li>and they really bothered me.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear make-up very often and it doesn&#x27;t cover them very well anyway, so the spots glared at me every time I looked in the mirror.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t really hurt.  </li>
            <li>and I cant really argue with that at all</li>
            <li>I can tell bc After a light application of my regular bb cream, I cant see them anymore!</li>
            <li>This product is really something; it helped me get rid of all my acne scars.</li>
            <li>I have used obagi for years (always hating how much it cost).</li>
            <li>This patch is much lighter now.  </li>
            <li>This works and is MUCH cheaper than what a doctor prescribed to me that didn&#x27;t work at all for my age spots.</li>
            <li>and I really haven&#x27;t seen much difference.</li>
            <li>Really works, just after 8-10 applications I notices a difference.</li>
            <li>.... Let&#x27;s be real:  How did you think you were going to get rid of those skin spots?  </li>
            <li>This product gets five stars because it works and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really lighten the area I have on my skin.</li>
            <li>Never use sterling silver jewelry that goes on your face, go with stainless steel.</li>
            <li>really didn&#x27;t notice any skin lightening for me.</li>
            <li>This really works but it takes a lot of time and patience.  </li>
            <li>Two others really wanted to come out</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Went through the whole tube and it didn&#x27;t seem to change a thing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now using real lemon juice on a cotton ball</li>
            <li>I never had much of a chance to see any difference while using this product.  </li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t use it much.  </li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>but it has taken me a while to find something that really does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s real.  </li>
            <li>Too much causes redness and peeling.</li>
            <li>To sum it up, I gave this product 3 stars although I really rate it 2 1/2.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s reasonably priced and seems to be working.  </li>
            <li>This product works really well</li>
            <li>I do not even use it as much as the box recommends and I already see a difference.  </li>
            <li>Amazon was lightning fast on getting this out to me -- I received it a couple days after placing the order</li>
            <li>it works fast too</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>Used up almost the whole thing, did not see any lightening.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really tell if this product worked or if it was just a placebo effect.</li>
            <li>but I really think this works.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t see much difference besides burned marks when I put too much on.  </li>
            <li>I bought this stuff without really believing it would work.  </li>
            <li>but it really works to lighten those pesky sunspots</li>
            <li>Was really looking forward to it.</li>
            <li>and I have very pigmented skin.</li>
            <li>For products to really work</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t see much results from using this cream</li>
            <li>Not seeing much progress.</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>Took much longer for the darkest spots to be lightened.</li>
            <li>However, this product really does lighten these spots after continuous usage of approx.</li>
            <li>I think this is a real beauty</li>
            <li>Thanks Alpha Hydrox.</li>
            <li>I just turned 40 and started noticing small pea sized brown spots on my fair, normal skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The process wasn&#x27;t pretty - my skin is pretty sensitive</li>
            <li>That cream not only didn&#x27;t make my age spots lighten, it lightened the entire area around them so that they&#x27;re kind of highlighted with a nice round, light circle, especially on my neck.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hydroquinone is actually the gold standard for treating any kind of age or sun spots.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ll probably have new marks to deal with now thanks to this!</li>
            <li>It smells pretty potent and sometimes it burns a little.</li>
            <li>I had two prominent brown patches on one cheek and another one on my other cheek.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product as I was looking for a skin lightener to help fade marks from a recent staph infection.</li>
            <li>My infection was originally folliculitis, which causes tiny acne-like pimples to form in the infected area.</li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would love to see reviews from other people who have tried this product.</li>
            <li>Also great for applying locally, as the applicator is quite small.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had the product long enough to know how effective it is at fading age spot and skin imperfections.</li>
            <li>I did not continue to use the product long enough to tell if it is effective or not.</li>
            <li>bought this because I thought that Alpha Hydrox with have a different effect on the skin and will do good for dark spots treatment.</li>
            <li>Judging by my own experience and the other reviews, this seems to be a hit or miss product, either hitting bullseye and doing perfect or missing off the chart and either doing absolutely nothing or making matters even worse.</li>
            <li>A few times I noticed patches of what I hoped was peeling to reveal nice, new skin.</li>
            <li>Got badly burned bright bright red</li>
            <li>This got rid of almost all of a huge long age spot on my forehead.  </li>
            <li>Not sure then what kind of &amp;#34;spots&amp;#34; it is supposed to whiten then...</li>
            <li>This product got rid of dark spots on my face and top of my hands.  </li>
            <li>I am still using it; so far, i am yet to see results; however, i am willing to continue using it and see if it delivers what it promises</li>
            <li>I am a fair skinned african american female.</li>
            <li>and my face didn&#x27;t have so many dark *sun spots</li>
            <li>This stuff worked within the first week of use, by week three, my darkest spots have lightened considerably, and my lighter ones have disappeared.</li>
            <li>Your skin will look brand new!</li>
            <li>As a 25 year old woman, I was devastated at the thought of having a HUGE red scar.  </li>
            <li>Through trial and error I learned that less really is more.</li>
            <li>had an odd, plastic-like smell but nothing repulsive or overwhelming.</li>
            <li>but i followed a reviewers advice less is more ..</li>
            <li>Its a great product for dark spots that are not too dark.</li>
            <li>Believe me when I say I have tried many, from the most expensive to the lowest priced.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes the most expensive with the most hype is the trashiest on delivery.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product daily for over a week and the marks have faded tremendously.</li>
            <li>So I wouldn&#x27;t buy this particular product again.</li>
            <li>So glad I tried this before I bought a more expensive Product.</li>
            <li>I love it, this is my 2nd or 3rd time ordering this product.</li>
            <li>Mostly importantly, I am getting my natural glowing skin complexion back.</li>
            <li>Yes, it takes a long time to work, but for the price, it is worth being patient!</li>
            <li>The cream is gentle on the skin, but strong on lightening the dark spots.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I must be social and confident in my personal life and professional life.</li>
            <li>Within 4 days, some of the spots were completely gone and with a week all of the new age spots were gone!!  </li>
            <li>Oh, and just to be safe, I still put a little on the spots that have almost faded to nothing.  </li>
            <li>I got this product last week and a week later the spots on my chin have significantly reduced!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned and freckled and plan to start very slowly to allow my skin to adjust to this product.</li>
            <li>I really like the applicator tip because it applies it directly on to the spot.</li>
            <li>Worked very well, faded the spots on my skin considerably but took about three weeks to be visible</li>
            <li>My scar has faded so much, its nearly invisible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>It also seemed to accelerate healing as the reddened area returned to normal skin color sooner.</li>
            <li>Overall an economical product that works.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had any success with using it almost daily  for a couple months</li>
            <li>My skin is darker than my makeup and hopefully this will help restore it to it&#x27;s normal shade</li>
            <li>but the only thing that really helps is staying completely out of the sun/wearing sunscreen!!!!  </li>
            <li>Anyways, now, 2 months later, anytime I get really nervous, the very light dots on my chest turn really red  until I calm down.</li>
            <li>a big brown blotch right on my cheek.  </li>
            <li>I am very fair skined and had a few brown spots that have faded very well over the last few weeks.</li>
            <li>I used this product to lighten my skin to normal after working in the sun for several months; I initially had a breakout of fine bumps</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t leave any other light marks on my skin as it lightens the wretched spots~</li>
            <li>As a result, just 1-3 new pimples every day would eventually yield a face covered in brown spots on my forehead, cheeks and chin.    </li>
            <li>This product chemically eats away at your skin and the new cells that grow replace the darkened area.  </li>
            <li>and I won&#x27;t have to invest in new cosmetics.</li>
            <li>My skin was very soft.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s pretty strong, so I always give my face a break from using it at least one or two days a week.  </li>
            <li>This product however,  within a days I began to see some difference which inspired me to continue and be regular and consistent with application.  </li>
            <li>At first, it made my skin red with it&#x27;s burning sensation, and I thought it was working</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lightener helps with overall skin tone and texture - I saw and felt a difference literally overnight the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>I keep my tube next to my bathroom sink to help me remember to apply it on a consistent basis.</li>
            <li>Old ones take time, but it works!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used better products in the past.  </li>
            <li>This is the first product that had results in a short time.  </li>
            <li>, I also exfoiliated the same areas before placing the product there, it will burn if you exfoilate first.</li>
            <li>other thing many may be unaware of is people who are allergic to sulfites may also react to hydroquinone.</li>
            <li>some medications, mostly injectables, do still contain a small amount as preservatives.</li>
            <li>I think if I continued using it daily the skin would become pinker and would not match the other skin on my face that is tan because its summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with the outcome and thankful I don&#x27;t have to have that masculine look.</li>
            <li>It is way less noticeable now since using the Spot light treatment.  </li>
            <li>Some countries have banned its use, that&#x27;s true, but the products which led to the ban in those countries were contaminated with toxins such as mercury which were likely the source of the problems.</li>
            <li>I have seen significant improvement in the lightening of my dark spots.</li>
            <li>still have more than half left</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s apparently inhibitting the formation of new blemishes and blackheads too!).</li>
            <li>and I am so excited to see what it will do for me down the road.</li>
            <li>I was not going to wear shorts this summer because the spot, although not that large, was such and eyesore.  </li>
            <li>careful in the sun, use it consistently and the results will come!</li>
            <li>clear.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t believe there is enough Alpha Hydroxy to do much, but I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>my face is almost all clear from blemish spots ...</li>
            <li>I have always had extremely clear, porcelain to peaches and cream skin, so these spots have bothered me a bit.</li>
            <li>I hope this helps clear up some confusion and leads to safer use of this product.</li>
            <li>The acid in the cream did cause a light stinging, and it caused a few sores, probably from my scratching the skin, as it did cause my skin to itch considerably.</li>
            <li>I was beginning to get discouraged last week, because I couldn&#x27;t see much, if any, improvement in the 3 dime-sized brown spots I&#x27;d developed over te summer.  </li>
            <li>This, in conjuction with my BHA 2% daily peel, has helped my hyperpigmentation so much.  </li>
            <li>DO NOT waste your money.</li>
            <li>The spots on my decollete are almost completely gone.  </li>
            <li>so I had to discontinue use of it, but the spots had nearly disappeared before I developed a reaction.</li>
            <li>After about two weeks, my age spot was completely gone.</li>
            <li>Used daily, this really helps with age spots.</li>
            <li>So far, everything else I&#x27;ve tried has had no impact.&lt;br</li>
            <li>lNot for the sensitive skin...horrible product.....</li>
            <li>However, it only worked so much.  </li>
            <li>and I developed hyperpigmentation from it.</li>
            <li>but nothing would either work fast enough or AT ALL!!!</li>
            <li>It turned red after a gentle exfoliation and I will update in a week.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it until the scar is completely gone.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have especially sensitive facial skin, so if you do, any of these products might bother you and you should proceed with caution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I apply it in the early morning before applying make up.</li>
            <li>and as of today, the color is fading into its natural color.</li>
            <li>It may be my skin is too sensitive.</li>
            <li>Thus far, the spots/scars are still there.  </li>
            <li>Although there are those who are sensitive or allergic to hydroquinone itself, I believe the AHA&#x27;s may be the culprit in a lot of the burning reported by some users.</li>
            <li>I bought this skin lightener about a month ago and have used it faithfully as directed for nearly 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Btw, my skin did react the first couple of times that I used it, becoming pink for a few hours after application.</li>
            <li>For me it worked better when i applied a thick layer</li>
            <li>Hmm it has a slightly funky smell, not bad</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best used when you can go without make-up, which I did for a week (scary!!!), but I don&#x27;t use it under makeup because it does have a little bit more of a substance to it and doesn&#x27;t absorb completely.  </li>
            <li>This product definitely works but you have to use it consistently over several weeks.</li>
            <li>I spent $60 on Clinique Even Better Dark Spot corrector and after two months I saw NO results.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida and have spent more time in the sun than I should, and although I am young I have developed two small areas of hyper pigmentation (or sunspots) on my face that drive me nuts.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While using this product I have been avoiding the sun as much as possible and using high SPF when it is unavoidable.  </li>
            <li>It has lightened the deeply discoloration on my nose and I am now seeing results after using it on \\&quot;sun spots\\&quot; or \\&quot;age spots\\&quot; as well..  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>A study where rats were injected with high levels of hydroquinone did produce cancer in those rats but there has never been any indication of a cancer risk with topical use.</li>
            <li>as greedy as i became on reading only the positive reviews, i decided to apply it on four different spots on my face!</li>
            <li>and I was getting dark marks around my smile lines after I got off birth control.</li>
            <li>skin normally has yellow under tones but where I used the Alpha Hydrox now</li>
            <li>I have had this product for a while but have not used it, however I am a big fan of many other Alpha Hydrox products and use various ones on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>This definitely worked to lighten the spots, but only to a certain extent.  </li>
            <li>so I give this little product a huge thumbs up for price, effectiveness, size and all of the above.</li>
            <li>I had two dark age spots right on the bridge of my nose, under my glasses</li>
            <li>dark spot emerged a couple years ago right on the end of my FREAKIN&#x27; nose and has been a bane of mine since then.  </li>
            <li>and I ended up with so much irration, dry skin, and redness on the spots I used it in.</li>
            <li>I really wish I had done a patch test or only used it on one spot initially.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much definitely will be purchasing again in the future!</li>
            <li>one that does not rip the outer layers of skin off your face...like a major chemical peel does...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s at least as good as the Murad dark spot treatment, and they work in about the same amount of time - two weeks for me, applying twice a day in the beginning and taking a break if there seems to be irritation.</li>
            <li>The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me and I have only noticed a very slight tingle from the Alpha Hydrox Spot Light once or twice.</li>
            <li>Be sure to wear serious sunscreen of the dark spots come right back.</li>
            <li>Works decent on new dark spots.</li>
            <li>a bonus, the 10% Glycolic Acid has improved the general texture of the skin on my hands</li>
            <li>Wake up next day to discover  TWO bruise like spots on each side of my face, near my jaw  </li>
            <li>Some take longer and some are barely affected.&lt;br</li>
            <li>some very obvious age/liver spots and an area near my thumb has a patch of what looks like melasma.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any freckles or scars on my face, but I wanted to simply whiten an area where a healed an already old pimple area</li>
            <li>Barely used any of it</li>
            <li>However, I decided to also use this on my face for some old red marks left from old acne.</li>
            <li>Dark spot on face is gone after consistent morning and night use for 5 weeks.</li>
            <li>I have used morning and night and there is barely any change to my freckles/age spots.</li>
            <li>I use it almost every night, dab some of this white cream and apply it directly onto the spot and let it sit on my skin spot area--</li>
            <li>Only gave this 3 stars at this point because I&#x27;m still early into the treatment.  </li>
            <li>This cram really works, be careful</li>
            <li>But all of a sudden, beginning on Monday of  this week, I detected a marked improvement in those places.  </li>
            <li>Today, Friday, one spot is gone, one is nearly gone, and one is definitely lighter and probably on the way to disappearing.  </li>
            <li>It took weeks of vitamin E cream to get the red spots back to normal...</li>
            <li>However, they will come back if re-exposed enough to the sun - but that is not a complaint of the product</li>
            <li>But this was not that expensive and it has been four months...and the tube is still more than half full...</li>
            <li>The only bad thing about this product is the smell, the price is great</li>
            <li>I suggest that you wash the area first with soap and water, then apply a small amount directly on the spot.</li>
            <li>It also burned my face, left it very red, but did help to lighten old marks.</li>
            <li>BUT IN FACT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 7 YEARS, I CAN ACTUALLY SEE A DIFFERENCE IN MY DARK SPOTS FROM TANNING FOR YEARS.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This cream started showing improvement of my facial dark spots within the first 3 days.</li>
            <li>After having been diagnosed with Vitiligo a few years ago (I am, thankfully, Caucasion and thus the condition is not very noticeable), I&#x27;ve started to notice what appears to be permanent freckles or sun damage on my face, which has appeared primarily where I have depigmentation.</li>
            <li>The dark spots I have are not that large.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this product 6weeks and see a major improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>There has been a 3 prong dot on my forehead - right smack in the middle for a few years now.  </li>
            <li>It will make your skin peel and be a little sensitive, so make sure to have a great moisturizer to use after, but the horrifying dark spot is gone OVERNIGHT</li>
            <li>This cream really does lighten dark spots.</li>
            <li>My dark spots are much darker and before.</li>
            <li>This product really does work to lighten dark skin spots.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much change in the dark spots on my face, but I am still using this product.  </li>
            <li>I have tried Garnier, Ambi, Murad and countless other products which haven&#x27;t done much of anything for me.</li>
            <li>I now go bare with just my sunscreen on my face and use the product only at night now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now starting round two, and I anticipate a few more iterations after this.  </li>
            <li>Also, if you put it on one area thickly, it will actually &#x27;burn&#x27; your skin and leave a nice red mark for a few days.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for less than a month and my dark spots on my face and neck have been significantly reduced.</li>
            <li>After a month or two of continuous use, I was pleasantly surprised the dark spot is completely</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks of going back to this cream, My dark spots are much lighter.</li>
            <li>my skin became crusty and then peeled off and eventually left my bare flesh open on the surface.</li>
            <li>After reading through the negative reviews, it occurred to me there may not be adequate warnings on the label or box.</li>
            <li>For this cheap price, it&#x27;s working for me slowly!</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it is taking a long time to fade more but as I have had that spot for at least ten years, I certainly can be patient.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slowly erasing the flaws one by one, and I&#x27;m starting to see the real me!!  </li>
            <li>I am extremely fair skinned so these spots were BAD</li>
            <li>Ive tried alot of products over the years,so I know the good and the bad.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> At any rate, I&#x27;m a happy camper.  </li>
            <li> Even though I must say this line has got great products like their glycolic line, at great prices, this somehow just does not work for me.</li>

            <li> Loved this product it works great</li>
            <li> I will be sure to reorder this wonderful cream from Deparfumes web site.  </li>
            <li> Smell is not so pleasant, but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and bought this product thinking it was the best of what was available over the counter.  </li>
            <li> Really good product.  </li>
            <li> Good thing though...</li>
            <li> it works and it smells nice; also it is a great alternative to</li>
            <li> Alpha Hydrox Spot Light is the best value out there for my needs; I just wish I&#x27;d found it ages ago.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery and good price.</li>
            <li> Did not work as good as I thought it would, but will keep using,&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s fair for me to pass any sort of judgement on it.  </li>
            <li> for the price this is good.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin with some sensitivity issues.</li>
            <li> so I would not put it on either AM or PM and use a good lotion instead.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice product at a great price, it does lighten spots, just do not expect that to happen overnight, give it a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> it is wise to read the directions and use according to those instructions.</li>
            <li> Effect can also, is the smell is not so good</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> However, the price is great so again its ok.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased that I purchased this product instead</li>
            <li> After doing some research and checking product ingredients, efficacy, pricing, and paula&#x27;s choice best reviews this was the best, most cost effective and high producing results product I found and am definitely thrilled I bought it.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> and I love it!  </li>
            <li> Cheap too!!</li>
            <li> I love this cream!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended this product to many people, it&#x27;s a steal!</li>
            <li> An amazing product for an amazing price.</li>
            <li> I decided to write a review because I want the world to know that this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> no results, i didnt want to put it all over my face for fear it might cause  some kind of skin problem (redness/peeling)  </li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t sing the praise of this stuff any better, it works, damn good.  </li>
            <li> Ordered two more so why stop a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Im really thrilled that they make this cream</li>
            <li> What kind of results did you get?</li>
            <li> And if you use this product, you MUST wear sunscreen or you will be doing more damage than good.</li>
            <li> Another plus about this cream is no irritation of any kind.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this brand, and I&#x27;m thrilled to have found it.  </li>
            <li> Smells very strong</li>
            <li> Maybe its more effective on lighter skinned persons.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product I have tried.</li>
            <li> Alpha Hydrox Spot Light Targeted Skin Lightener and Porcelana seemed to have good reviews</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really strong and works very fast!!!!</li>
            <li> For those who experienced a redness in the spot area in the beginning, I experienced the same but persevered and the redness eventually faded.  </li>
            <li> I am pretty happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I guess the price was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> At this point, additional applications hurt a bit more so what I did was apply skin moisturizer on top.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I love Alpha Hydroxy brand.  </li>
            <li> the shipping cost more than the product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Like so many products, it&#x27;s trial and error.</li>
            <li> i will have to give it more time.</li>
            <li> (Mostly, like have to put my face 3 inches from the mirror to see any discoloration)  </li>
            <li> But be sure to use sunscreen when you are in the sun afterwards.</li>
            <li> I cant stop using thiis stuff..clears up my skin so its more of an even tone.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d never get rid of it, after trying so many products.</li>
            <li> but this product is much better.</li>
            <li> This brought even better results.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased to say that this product is working so well for me.</li>
            <li> Then it peeled off and the spot magically went with it.</li>
            <li> My esthetician advised to never to use this for more than a 30 day stretch</li>
            <li> maybe for someone else it works better</li>
            <li> I am going to order three more tubes.</li>
            <li> know it gets better later).That cream</li>
            <li> and Ive just ordered 3 more.  </li>
            <li> most people expect a magic product that works over night but this has worked okay for the price and time.</li>
            <li> Better prices here.</li>
            <li> A lot better.</li>
            <li> I had wanted to use it on a crop of freckles on my nose that were cute when I was 12, but now they just look like smudges of dirt.  </li>
            <li> I should have tried more to use it.</li>
            <li> :) I found this product after searching through http://www.paulaschoice.com/beautypedia/</li>
            <li> and I love this product.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product mostly on my nose because it&#x27;s not shielded when I wear sunglasses.  </li>
            <li> I have always love alpha hydroxy products.</li>
            <li> I FIGURED IT WOULD BE JUST ONE MORE TUBE</li>
            <li> I love this cream</li>
            <li> I guess more feminine.</li>
            <li> I expect as time goes on that they will fade even more.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not quite sure if it works or not.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had some marks left from acne on my chest and they weren&#x27;t very attractive.</li>
            <li> Better products available that do work!  </li>
            <li> Our dermatologist recommended it once it was safe to use on my daughter&#x27;s skin.&lt;br /&gt;A note about hydroquinone....</li>
            <li> I wish for a magic potion to remove them all together...</li>
            <li> so I ended up spending way more</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve even been able to stop using my deordorant.</li>
            <li> Better than the $100+ bottle.  </li>
            <li> Not terrible</li>
            <li> will recommend to a friend and buy another tube:)</li>
            <li> My skin looks more even toned.</li>
            <li> Hydroquinone is, for the most part, a safe product.</li>
            <li> No product containing hydroquinone should ever be used in combination with any form of peroxide including benzoyl peroxide meaning most acne medications should not be used along with it.</li>
            <li> I purchased it to treat the age spots on the top of my hands.</li>
            <li> This is a light weight lotion with 2% hydroquinone plus 10% Glycolic adic at a ph of 3.3 which makes the product effective.  </li>
            <li> I have heard that putting on a good moisturizer first would help.  </li>
            <li> and my darks spots were significantly lighter!</li>
            <li> and I can already tell a significant difference!</li>
            <li> I use other products by this brand and love them, but this one really impressed me!</li>
            <li> Do better with any cheap product over the counter</li>
            <li> But on the newer age spots, it was incredible, especially for the price!  </li>
            <li> I started looking into laser therapy and was becoming hopeless.</li>
            <li> I did not hesitate to try this as their products have always been effective and economical.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on the top of my hands for just 2 weeks and am very pleased with the results so far!!!  </li>
            <li> It is easy to apply on your skin.</li>
            <li> In my case the lotion has done a lot more harm than good; I&#x27;m surprised it&#x27;s sold over the counter.</li>
            <li> Super age-spot lightener, very light and no signature hydroquinone odor.  </li>
            <li> If you can stand the stinky smell on your hands and area that you cover with Alpha Hydrox, then the product is fine.</li>
            <li> This product is good, but seems to be a bit strong for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The smell is fine and the texture is light and almost gel like</li>
            <li> However after 3 applications I noticed a huge improvement to my noticeably darkening freckles.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a week and can already see a huge improvement in my sun spots.  </li>
            <li> I get compliments on my flawless skin almost everyday.</li>
            <li> It really helps the skin to lighten&lt;br /&gt;evenly and nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely thrilled at how fast this is working.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m light - med combination skin</li>
            <li> I was watching Dr. Oz and they talk about alpha hydrox spot light.</li>
            <li> /decrease my use of foundation, which I used to primarily cover blemishes.</li>
            <li> AND...its damn cheap.  </li>
            <li> So happy, my confidence is back through the roof.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Alpha Hydrox Spot Light Targeted Skin Lightener for a month.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s most definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li> No further comments as I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, it is cheap</li>
            <li> I used this Alpha Hydrox Spot Light for 3 weeks and got my desired result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is cheap too.</li>
            <li> My brown spots are now a light brown and are continuing to fade.</li>
            <li> (I did \\&quot;free</li>
            <li> A pleasing light scent.</li>
            <li> I did some research on amazon.com and found their Product, Spot Light.</li>
            <li> 2% is the strongest dose available without a prescription.</li>
            <li> Alpha Hydrox Spot Light Targeted Skin Lightener is a cost-effective lightener.</li>
            <li> Spot Light Skin Lightner Fade Cream :  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on about my seventh day, and so far so good.  </li>
            <li> I am thrilled and can&#x27;t wait to see how it will look in a few more weeks!!</li>
            <li> and I already noticed a huge change, I originally got it for acne scars on 2 areas of my face</li>
            <li> Works fairly well on spots and has lightened many of my targeted hyperpigmented areas, though some not completely.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the positive reviews, and all I can say is that I&#x27;m glad it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited</li>
            <li> I cannot tell yet if the spots will become significantly lighter or not.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re still there, and I&#x27;m sure it will take time for it to heal completely, but so far the results are great.</li>
            <li> Thanks! : )</li>
            <li> but I have to say that it was so worth it!</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more very soon !</li>
            <li> Ok, first I stand by Alpha Hydrox products and I also stand by this one.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled that such an inexpensive cream is so effective and so FAST!</li>
            <li> Well, I guess going from brown spots to bright red is a bit lighter.  </li>
            <li> similar ones that are not as good.</li>
            <li> I ordered it that day to see how good it was for only $10.00.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use much of this cream so why not be safe rather than sorry?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good stuff, you definitely have to keep at it though.  </li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t expecting to get it for a full week).</li>
            <li> been using for 4 weeks 15 reduction ..will keep at it for the full 12 weeks</li>
            <li> But the spots that are darker than others on my face havent really changed..unless it takes more time.</li>
            <li> I will give it the full trial and see what happens.</li>
            <li> Just since purchasing a month ago, my age spots under my eyes are gone, I&#x27;m still working on the ones on my upper lip but they have been there longer and are more abundant and dominant, so make sure you catch those age spots early!</li>
            <li> THANKS FROM A REAL PERSON IN FLORIDA!!!!</li>
            <li> The hydroquinone and 10% glycolic acid formula in Spot Light is right on the money.</li>
            <li> As of yesterday, I noticed that one other freckle has gotten DARKER, and the rest of my spots have experienced no change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was going to buy souffle but picked this up instead as it was on super saver shipping.</li>
            <li> For a decade, I&#x27;ve been plagued with mild acne since I was a teenager</li>
            <li> After about 10 days, one spot looked as if I&#x27;d mildly burned myself with a curling iron.</li>
            <li> I now have mild acne</li>
            <li> It really works great, especially under my arms.</li>
            <li> and I saw results quickly</li>
            <li> Great product - does work in lightening the dark spots on my face.  </li>
            <li> Great for dark SPOTS ♡♡♡</li>
            <li> it is great on my dark spots that I got on my leg</li>
            <li> Worked and works great on my dark spots.  </li>
            <li> I applied it 4 times on my hand and in 1 days it started to peel with bright clear new skin underneath!</li>
            <li> AHA 10% in this product is high for those who are not used to it and who may have sensitive or fair skin.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t have much smell and isn&#x27;t greasy like others.</li>
            <li> I swear within the first week I saw a noticeable difference!  </li>
            <li> This works fast!!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell great and feels a little greasy.</li>
            <li> Got it real fast.  </li>
            <li> For the price, it might be worth it.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll try a more natural product.</li>
            <li> The cheaper stuff (Porcelana) with hydroquinone worked far better for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> My skin texture has gone through an unremarkable change as well, more like the covered skin under my shirt, soft and glowing.</li>
            <li> Ive tried many products to try and clear it</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s worth it for me.</li>
            <li> So far, I am pleased.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and was concerned this would burn, but only experienced the slightest amount of tingle right after applying it.</li>
            <li> But take note, this product does have 2% hydroquinone, which is known for lightening up dark spots quickly, but also is known for causing cancers, So make a wise decision on using this product.</li>
            <li> If you have tried other products by this excellent brand (such as the Soufflé cream), you will know what to expect.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with her noticing the significant change from my last visit.</li>
            <li> but I had to apply it twice per day, generously right on the spot.</li>
            <li> I started using right away .</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> I switched to prescription TriLuma and that worked almost right away.</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t advise using it right before you want to go out.</li>
            <li> Started using it right away, within 2 weeks I could see a difference.</li>
            <li> The price was right</li>
            <li> this has worked great on my dark spots and really evened out my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> So I found this product and got it mainly because it was cheap, hoping it would help.</li>
            <li> This product works fine, I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This stuff is very strong and will actually burn your skin if you overuse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure everyone reacts in their own unique way, but considering I expected little to begin with, I&#x27;m satisfied with these preliminary results.</li>
            <li> Since it seems to be effective and quite quick, I want to be careful not to bleach my skin.</li>
            <li> and I noticed something kind of strange happening.</li>
            <li> Good product to fade dark spots/melasma</li>
            <li> I have dark patches on my fair skin, immediately under my ears.  </li>
            <li> The first week one of my freckles loosened up and peeled right off</li>
            <li> (I have fair, relatively sensitive asian skin).  </li>
            <li> But is is really smooth and makes my skin soft!</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I have only used it two more times this week and after a few days it started to peel all on its own!</li>
            <li> And I have a very light, Irish complexion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i love this product, i have used so many different products for my dark spots but nothing worked as good as this, especially since im in Afghanistan and the weather and water does not help.</li>
            <li> When you first use it, you may feel and see no result.</li>
            <li> Make sure if you are in the sun that you use sunscreen or the spots come back.</li>
            <li> Order came when it should and order is exactly what and</li>
            <li> (like I did the first time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been religious about using it twice a day, but use it twice a day on most days.  </li>
            <li> but this is the first time I ever tried using any AHA&#x27;s let alone Hydroquinone on my hands.  </li>
            <li> You have to use this consistently for it to work.  </li>
            <li> This year I got my first age spot on my face.  </li>
            <li> With only using it for three weeks, my skin is better and the brown spots are just going away.</li>
            <li> In time, you&#x27;ll be amazed when you discover a spot has pretty much disappeared!  </li>
            <li> The price of this product made me skeptical, but I was so happy with it!  </li>
            <li> If you decide to use, test it first before diving head-first.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> You will likely peel a bit - this is NORMAL for this kind of product.  </li>
            <li> FOR REAL!</li>
            <li> I think the prescription strengths would work better (obviously), but this one works alright.</li>
            <li> so this product will probably last around 3 - 6 months depending on how many places you use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand of foot cream with no ill effects.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I will buy a second tube soon:)</li>
            <li> I feel like it was working the first two weeks</li>
            <li> My daughter mentioned it recently which prompted me to research which products had the most chance of working.</li>
            <li> Most people living now would not be aware if they have this allergy and might have a cross reaction to this</li>
            <li> Overall, I was pleased with the product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> It stings a bit at first, but did not break my face out.</li>
            <li> When i first got this product i put it on at night n</li>
            <li> Both spots have significantly lightened and one is almost gone completely.</li>
            <li> The spot has turned from light brown to light pink.  </li>
            <li> Only used it for a week when my skin started to become bright red with irritation.  </li>
            <li> If you want fast results, make sure to use it twice daily.</li>
            <li> I am delighted with the results as larger, darker spots are fading, and the smaller lighter ones have gone!!!&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> then I  developed more of those lovely spots on my face and grew impatient and tried prescription Retin-A cream.  </li>
            <li> After the first day, my skin reacted by hyper-secreting oils, and the whole areas where I applied the product looked darker, like I had been under the sun tanning.</li>
            <li> The two largest spots on my face which I named archipelago and figure-eight because this is exactly what they looked like; have faded so much that I can now see my face, where before I did not see &#x27;the forest for the trees&#x27; - meaning when I looked at myself in a mirror</li>
            <li> Just as good, if not better than obagi.</li>
            <li> (I recommend applying sparingly on clean, dry skin right after cleansing--just right on the spots), and applied just moisturizer and sunscreen during the day, as I believe exposing your skin to sunrays with the product on your face causes hyper-pigmentation of the skin.    </li>
            <li> and I am amazed at how fast and effective the results are on my dark skin.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m certain that by 4 weeks</li>
            <li> It was so large people sometimes asked me if it was a birth mark.  </li>
            <li> I am an esthetician and just started getting some hyper-pigmentation in certain areas, I have never used hydro-quinine and was always a bit apprehensive.</li>
            <li> So far I have some of the same issues that others have experienced, such as stinging, dry flaking skin on spots treated and some spots becoming darker.  </li>
            <li> I even had some new scars that faded and are practically invisible now after just 3 days!!</li>
            <li> I never expected this cream to make such a difference but am happy to say that the skin is looking overall smoother and clearer.  </li>
            <li> I have had this darned brown spot on my face for a few years, and nothing screams ol&#x27; lady more than that!  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product it works very well with the other Alpha products.&lt;br /&gt;I will write back later with full results of skin discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;Quick fast shipment and great customer service.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to use regularly but can certainly tell a difference after the few days to a week that I was able to apply it.  </li>
            <li> I had been using 10% Alpha hydrox cream for a few weeks and wasnt happy with the initial condition of my skin(I</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really do the job but with this price, I can&#x27;t expect too much.  </li>
            <li> Within a week age spots on face and hands were much lighter.  </li>
            <li> It could VERY well just be my skin</li>
            <li> and they really bothered me.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear make-up very often and it doesn&#x27;t cover them very well anyway, so the spots glared at me every time I looked in the mirror.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t really hurt.  </li>
            <li> and I cant really argue with that at all</li>
            <li> I can tell bc After a light application of my regular bb cream, I cant see them anymore!</li>
            <li> This product is really something; it helped me get rid of all my acne scars.</li>
            <li> I have used obagi for years (always hating how much it cost).</li>
            <li> This patch is much lighter now.  </li>
            <li> This works and is MUCH cheaper than what a doctor prescribed to me that didn&#x27;t work at all for my age spots.</li>
            <li> and I really haven&#x27;t seen much difference.</li>
            <li> Really works, just after 8-10 applications I notices a difference.</li>
            <li> .... Let&#x27;s be real:  How did you think you were going to get rid of those skin spots?  </li>
            <li> This product gets five stars because it works and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really lighten the area I have on my skin.</li>
            <li> Never use sterling silver jewelry that goes on your face, go with stainless steel.</li>
            <li> really didn&#x27;t notice any skin lightening for me.</li>
            <li> This really works but it takes a lot of time and patience.  </li>
            <li> Two others really wanted to come out</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Went through the whole tube and it didn&#x27;t seem to change a thing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now using real lemon juice on a cotton ball</li>
            <li> I never had much of a chance to see any difference while using this product.  </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t use it much.  </li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> but it has taken me a while to find something that really does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s real.  </li>
            <li> Too much causes redness and peeling.</li>
            <li> To sum it up, I gave this product 3 stars although I really rate it 2 1/2.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s reasonably priced and seems to be working.  </li>
            <li> This product works really well</li>
            <li> I do not even use it as much as the box recommends and I already see a difference.  </li>
            <li> Amazon was lightning fast on getting this out to me -- I received it a couple days after placing the order</li>
            <li> it works fast too</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> Used up almost the whole thing, did not see any lightening.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really tell if this product worked or if it was just a placebo effect.</li>
            <li> but I really think this works.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see much difference besides burned marks when I put too much on.  </li>
            <li> I bought this stuff without really believing it would work.  </li>
            <li> but it really works to lighten those pesky sunspots</li>
            <li> Was really looking forward to it.</li>
            <li> and I have very pigmented skin.</li>
            <li> For products to really work</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t see much results from using this cream</li>
            <li> Not seeing much progress.</li>
            <li> This really works.</li>
            <li> Took much longer for the darkest spots to be lightened.</li>
            <li> However, this product really does lighten these spots after continuous usage of approx.</li>
            <li> I think this is a real beauty</li>
            <li> Thanks Alpha Hydrox.</li>
            <li> I just turned 40 and started noticing small pea sized brown spots on my fair, normal skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The process wasn&#x27;t pretty - my skin is pretty sensitive</li>
            <li> That cream not only didn&#x27;t make my age spots lighten, it lightened the entire area around them so that they&#x27;re kind of highlighted with a nice round, light circle, especially on my neck.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hydroquinone is actually the gold standard for treating any kind of age or sun spots.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ll probably have new marks to deal with now thanks to this!</li>
            <li> It smells pretty potent and sometimes it burns a little.</li>
            <li> I had two prominent brown patches on one cheek and another one on my other cheek.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product as I was looking for a skin lightener to help fade marks from a recent staph infection.</li>
            <li> My infection was originally folliculitis, which causes tiny acne-like pimples to form in the infected area.</li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would love to see reviews from other people who have tried this product.</li>
            <li> Also great for applying locally, as the applicator is quite small.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the product long enough to know how effective it is at fading age spot and skin imperfections.</li>
            <li> I did not continue to use the product long enough to tell if it is effective or not.</li>
            <li> bought this because I thought that Alpha Hydrox with have a different effect on the skin and will do good for dark spots treatment.</li>
            <li> Judging by my own experience and the other reviews, this seems to be a hit or miss product, either hitting bullseye and doing perfect or missing off the chart and either doing absolutely nothing or making matters even worse.</li>
            <li> A few times I noticed patches of what I hoped was peeling to reveal nice, new skin.</li>
            <li> Got badly burned bright bright red</li>
            <li> This got rid of almost all of a huge long age spot on my forehead.  </li>
            <li> Not sure then what kind of &amp;#34;spots&amp;#34; it is supposed to whiten then...</li>
            <li> This product got rid of dark spots on my face and top of my hands.  </li>
            <li> I am still using it; so far, i am yet to see results; however, i am willing to continue using it and see if it delivers what it promises</li>
            <li> I am a fair skinned african american female.</li>
            <li> and my face didn&#x27;t have so many dark *sun spots</li>
            <li> This stuff worked within the first week of use, by week three, my darkest spots have lightened considerably, and my lighter ones have disappeared.</li>
            <li> Your skin will look brand new!</li>
            <li> As a 25 year old woman, I was devastated at the thought of having a HUGE red scar.  </li>
            <li> Through trial and error I learned that less really is more.</li>
            <li> had an odd, plastic-like smell but nothing repulsive or overwhelming.</li>
            <li> but i followed a reviewers advice less is more ..</li>
            <li> Its a great product for dark spots that are not too dark.</li>
            <li> Believe me when I say I have tried many, from the most expensive to the lowest priced.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes the most expensive with the most hype is the trashiest on delivery.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product daily for over a week and the marks have faded tremendously.</li>
            <li> So I wouldn&#x27;t buy this particular product again.</li>
            <li> So glad I tried this before I bought a more expensive Product.</li>
            <li> I love it, this is my 2nd or 3rd time ordering this product.</li>
            <li> Mostly importantly, I am getting my natural glowing skin complexion back.</li>
            <li> Yes, it takes a long time to work, but for the price, it is worth being patient!</li>
            <li> The cream is gentle on the skin, but strong on lightening the dark spots.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I must be social and confident in my personal life and professional life.</li>
            <li> Within 4 days, some of the spots were completely gone and with a week all of the new age spots were gone!!  </li>
            <li> Oh, and just to be safe, I still put a little on the spots that have almost faded to nothing.  </li>
            <li> I got this product last week and a week later the spots on my chin have significantly reduced!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned and freckled and plan to start very slowly to allow my skin to adjust to this product.</li>
            <li> I really like the applicator tip because it applies it directly on to the spot.</li>
            <li> Worked very well, faded the spots on my skin considerably but took about three weeks to be visible</li>
            <li> My scar has faded so much, its nearly invisible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> It also seemed to accelerate healing as the reddened area returned to normal skin color sooner.</li>
            <li> Overall an economical product that works.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had any success with using it almost daily  for a couple months</li>
            <li> My skin is darker than my makeup and hopefully this will help restore it to it&#x27;s normal shade</li>
            <li> but the only thing that really helps is staying completely out of the sun/wearing sunscreen!!!!  </li>
            <li> Anyways, now, 2 months later, anytime I get really nervous, the very light dots on my chest turn really red  until I calm down.</li>
            <li> a big brown blotch right on my cheek.  </li>
            <li> I am very fair skined and had a few brown spots that have faded very well over the last few weeks.</li>
            <li> I used this product to lighten my skin to normal after working in the sun for several months; I initially had a breakout of fine bumps</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t leave any other light marks on my skin as it lightens the wretched spots~</li>
            <li> As a result, just 1-3 new pimples every day would eventually yield a face covered in brown spots on my forehead, cheeks and chin.    </li>
            <li> This product chemically eats away at your skin and the new cells that grow replace the darkened area.  </li>
            <li> and I won&#x27;t have to invest in new cosmetics.</li>
            <li> My skin was very soft.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s pretty strong, so I always give my face a break from using it at least one or two days a week.  </li>
            <li> This product however,  within a days I began to see some difference which inspired me to continue and be regular and consistent with application.  </li>
            <li> At first, it made my skin red with it&#x27;s burning sensation, and I thought it was working</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lightener helps with overall skin tone and texture - I saw and felt a difference literally overnight the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> I keep my tube next to my bathroom sink to help me remember to apply it on a consistent basis.</li>
            <li> Old ones take time, but it works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used better products in the past.  </li>
            <li> This is the first product that had results in a short time.  </li>
            <li> , I also exfoiliated the same areas before placing the product there, it will burn if you exfoilate first.</li>
            <li> other thing many may be unaware of is people who are allergic to sulfites may also react to hydroquinone.</li>
            <li> some medications, mostly injectables, do still contain a small amount as preservatives.</li>
            <li> I think if I continued using it daily the skin would become pinker and would not match the other skin on my face that is tan because its summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with the outcome and thankful I don&#x27;t have to have that masculine look.</li>
            <li> It is way less noticeable now since using the Spot light treatment.  </li>
            <li> Some countries have banned its use, that&#x27;s true, but the products which led to the ban in those countries were contaminated with toxins such as mercury which were likely the source of the problems.</li>
            <li> I have seen significant improvement in the lightening of my dark spots.</li>
            <li> still have more than half left</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s apparently inhibitting the formation of new blemishes and blackheads too!).</li>
            <li> and I am so excited to see what it will do for me down the road.</li>
            <li> I was not going to wear shorts this summer because the spot, although not that large, was such and eyesore.  </li>
            <li> careful in the sun, use it consistently and the results will come!</li>
            <li> clear.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe there is enough Alpha Hydroxy to do much, but I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> my face is almost all clear from blemish spots ...</li>
            <li> I have always had extremely clear, porcelain to peaches and cream skin, so these spots have bothered me a bit.</li>
            <li> I hope this helps clear up some confusion and leads to safer use of this product.</li>
            <li> The acid in the cream did cause a light stinging, and it caused a few sores, probably from my scratching the skin, as it did cause my skin to itch considerably.</li>
            <li> I was beginning to get discouraged last week, because I couldn&#x27;t see much, if any, improvement in the 3 dime-sized brown spots I&#x27;d developed over te summer.  </li>
            <li> This, in conjuction with my BHA 2% daily peel, has helped my hyperpigmentation so much.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT waste your money.</li>
            <li> The spots on my decollete are almost completely gone.  </li>
            <li> so I had to discontinue use of it, but the spots had nearly disappeared before I developed a reaction.</li>
            <li> After about two weeks, my age spot was completely gone.</li>
            <li> Used daily, this really helps with age spots.</li>
            <li> So far, everything else I&#x27;ve tried has had no impact.&lt;br</li>
            <li> lNot for the sensitive skin...horrible product.....</li>
            <li> However, it only worked so much.  </li>
            <li> and I developed hyperpigmentation from it.</li>
            <li> but nothing would either work fast enough or AT ALL!!!</li>
            <li> It turned red after a gentle exfoliation and I will update in a week.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it until the scar is completely gone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have especially sensitive facial skin, so if you do, any of these products might bother you and you should proceed with caution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I apply it in the early morning before applying make up.</li>
            <li> and as of today, the color is fading into its natural color.</li>
            <li> It may be my skin is too sensitive.</li>
            <li> Thus far, the spots/scars are still there.  </li>
            <li> Although there are those who are sensitive or allergic to hydroquinone itself, I believe the AHA&#x27;s may be the culprit in a lot of the burning reported by some users.</li>
            <li> I bought this skin lightener about a month ago and have used it faithfully as directed for nearly 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Btw, my skin did react the first couple of times that I used it, becoming pink for a few hours after application.</li>
            <li> For me it worked better when i applied a thick layer</li>
            <li> Hmm it has a slightly funky smell, not bad</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best used when you can go without make-up, which I did for a week (scary!!!), but I don&#x27;t use it under makeup because it does have a little bit more of a substance to it and doesn&#x27;t absorb completely.  </li>
            <li> This product definitely works but you have to use it consistently over several weeks.</li>
            <li> I spent $60 on Clinique Even Better Dark Spot corrector and after two months I saw NO results.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and have spent more time in the sun than I should, and although I am young I have developed two small areas of hyper pigmentation (or sunspots) on my face that drive me nuts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While using this product I have been avoiding the sun as much as possible and using high SPF when it is unavoidable.  </li>
            <li> It has lightened the deeply discoloration on my nose and I am now seeing results after using it on \\&quot;sun spots\\&quot; or \\&quot;age spots\\&quot; as well..  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> A study where rats were injected with high levels of hydroquinone did produce cancer in those rats but there has never been any indication of a cancer risk with topical use.</li>
            <li> as greedy as i became on reading only the positive reviews, i decided to apply it on four different spots on my face!</li>
            <li> and I was getting dark marks around my smile lines after I got off birth control.</li>
            <li> skin normally has yellow under tones but where I used the Alpha Hydrox now</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a while but have not used it, however I am a big fan of many other Alpha Hydrox products and use various ones on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> This definitely worked to lighten the spots, but only to a certain extent.  </li>
            <li> so I give this little product a huge thumbs up for price, effectiveness, size and all of the above.</li>
            <li> I had two dark age spots right on the bridge of my nose, under my glasses</li>
            <li> dark spot emerged a couple years ago right on the end of my FREAKIN&#x27; nose and has been a bane of mine since then.  </li>
            <li> and I ended up with so much irration, dry skin, and redness on the spots I used it in.</li>
            <li> I really wish I had done a patch test or only used it on one spot initially.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much definitely will be purchasing again in the future!</li>
            <li> one that does not rip the outer layers of skin off your face...like a major chemical peel does...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s at least as good as the Murad dark spot treatment, and they work in about the same amount of time - two weeks for me, applying twice a day in the beginning and taking a break if there seems to be irritation.</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me and I have only noticed a very slight tingle from the Alpha Hydrox Spot Light once or twice.</li>
            <li> Be sure to wear serious sunscreen of the dark spots come right back.</li>
            <li> Works decent on new dark spots.</li>
            <li> a bonus, the 10% Glycolic Acid has improved the general texture of the skin on my hands</li>
            <li> Wake up next day to discover  TWO bruise like spots on each side of my face, near my jaw  </li>
            <li> Some take longer and some are barely affected.&lt;br</li>
            <li> some very obvious age/liver spots and an area near my thumb has a patch of what looks like melasma.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any freckles or scars on my face, but I wanted to simply whiten an area where a healed an already old pimple area</li>
            <li> Barely used any of it</li>
            <li> However, I decided to also use this on my face for some old red marks left from old acne.</li>
            <li> Dark spot on face is gone after consistent morning and night use for 5 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have used morning and night and there is barely any change to my freckles/age spots.</li>
            <li> I use it almost every night, dab some of this white cream and apply it directly onto the spot and let it sit on my skin spot area--</li>
            <li> Only gave this 3 stars at this point because I&#x27;m still early into the treatment.  </li>
            <li> This cram really works, be careful</li>
            <li> But all of a sudden, beginning on Monday of  this week, I detected a marked improvement in those places.  </li>
            <li> Today, Friday, one spot is gone, one is nearly gone, and one is definitely lighter and probably on the way to disappearing.  </li>
            <li> It took weeks of vitamin E cream to get the red spots back to normal...</li>
            <li> However, they will come back if re-exposed enough to the sun - but that is not a complaint of the product</li>
            <li> But this was not that expensive and it has been four months...and the tube is still more than half full...</li>
            <li> The only bad thing about this product is the smell, the price is great</li>
            <li> I suggest that you wash the area first with soap and water, then apply a small amount directly on the spot.</li>
            <li> It also burned my face, left it very red, but did help to lighten old marks.</li>
            <li> BUT IN FACT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 7 YEARS, I CAN ACTUALLY SEE A DIFFERENCE IN MY DARK SPOTS FROM TANNING FOR YEARS.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This cream started showing improvement of my facial dark spots within the first 3 days.</li>
            <li> After having been diagnosed with Vitiligo a few years ago (I am, thankfully, Caucasion and thus the condition is not very noticeable), I&#x27;ve started to notice what appears to be permanent freckles or sun damage on my face, which has appeared primarily where I have depigmentation.</li>
            <li> The dark spots I have are not that large.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product 6weeks and see a major improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> There has been a 3 prong dot on my forehead - right smack in the middle for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> It will make your skin peel and be a little sensitive, so make sure to have a great moisturizer to use after, but the horrifying dark spot is gone OVERNIGHT</li>
            <li> This cream really does lighten dark spots.</li>
            <li> My dark spots are much darker and before.</li>
            <li> This product really does work to lighten dark skin spots.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much change in the dark spots on my face, but I am still using this product.  </li>
            <li> I have tried Garnier, Ambi, Murad and countless other products which haven&#x27;t done much of anything for me.</li>
            <li> I now go bare with just my sunscreen on my face and use the product only at night now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now starting round two, and I anticipate a few more iterations after this.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you put it on one area thickly, it will actually &#x27;burn&#x27; your skin and leave a nice red mark for a few days.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for less than a month and my dark spots on my face and neck have been significantly reduced.</li>
            <li> After a month or two of continuous use, I was pleasantly surprised the dark spot is completely</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of going back to this cream, My dark spots are much lighter.</li>
            <li> my skin became crusty and then peeled off and eventually left my bare flesh open on the surface.</li>
            <li> After reading through the negative reviews, it occurred to me there may not be adequate warnings on the label or box.</li>
            <li> For this cheap price, it&#x27;s working for me slowly!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is taking a long time to fade more but as I have had that spot for at least ten years, I certainly can be patient.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slowly erasing the flaws one by one, and I&#x27;m starting to see the real me!!  </li>
            <li> I am extremely fair skinned so these spots were BAD</li>
            <li> Ive tried alot of products over the years,so I know the good and the bad.  </li>
            <li> Tiny brown marks, the size of moles or freckles, seemed to get darker, scab over, then fall off, leaving a fresh pinkish area that slowly fades into the rest of the skin.</li>
            <li> Half a tube gone, and a month later my forehead is almost COMPLETELY back to normal...</li>
            <li> In other words, it can look slightly worse before it gets better.</li>
            <li> it has worked fine with me by lighting my dark spots slowly and has helped new ones from forming too dark.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and is a reasonable price product.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed a difference on a dark spot near my thigh as it has indeed gotten lighter!</li>
            <li> On top of that made me break out super bad!</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I developed dark pigmentation on my upper lip AFTER I gave birth to my son in July of 2011.  </li>
            <li> The age spots, large and small, were unchanged.</li>
            <li> I am only 21 years old and ocronosis is typically permanent.  </li>
            <li> Left my skin red, irritated, and dry.</li>
            <li> If you want an option without pain, consider laser treatment at a doctor&#x27;s office, but if you are willing to put up with some uncomfortableness, and use common sense</li>
            <li> buyers be aware, and I m not the type of person with delicate skin.</li>
            <li> I put a small dot on each cheek once in the AM and once in the PM - really massaging it into the age spot areas.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> I was very skeptic based on past hype and experience with scar and blemish creams.</li>
            <li> The scar itself would last 10 times longer than the pimple, not completely fading for months at time.  </li>
            <li> The spots on my are not completely gone yet, but are vastly reduced in appearance.</li>
            <li> As long as you are diligent about applying twice daily.</li>
            <li> Still a long way to go to get what I want to see which is the spots gone entirely.  </li>
            <li> It has actually eliminated some of the minor spots.  </li>
            <li> I stopped seeing that dermatologist, but recently started attending a medical spa center for different skin care.</li>
            <li> But when using I would be careful to only apply to the specific area you are trying to lighten, and not get too generous</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this item a few times since I purchased it, and already the blotch has faded considerably.  </li>
            <li> Larger red marks, the size of about a pea, just gradually fade to a lighter pink.</li>
            <li> Active ingredient is Hydroquinone for skin bleaching is the main active ingredient....known to cause cancer.</li>
            <li> It works slowly, so you can&#x27;t really tell from one day to the next if its doing anything.  </li>
            <li> I had a few major coppery brown freckles that were getting out of hand, especially one on the cheekbone below my left iris.</li>
            <li> Sulfites are strictly limited in processed foods now to a level not likely to cause reactions but</li>
            <li> By the way, if you have sensitive skin, as I do, don&#x27;t use twice a day, only use once at night before bed and only use a small amount.</li>
            <li> A few months ago, I bumped my lower leg on my bed rail and it left a large black spot on it that just wouldn&#x27;t go away no matter what I tried.</li>
            <li> and I may or may not purchase again when my long lasting supply runs dry.</li>
            <li> so it was no major loss!</li>
            <li> One minor drawback is that it contains mineral oil which causes breakouts on me, but it&#x27;s not a major issue because I apply it in dots.</li>
            <li> The product does tingle a bit when you first put it on but nothing serious.  </li>
            <li> Will probably start out using it every other night and cut back if irritation develops to every 3rd night until my skin gets accustomed to it.</li>
            <li> I am a 18 year old female who suffers from mild acne on the lower sections of my cheeks and on my chin</li>
            <li> In fact, it can be so hard to see from day to day that you think it isn&#x27;t working, so taking a &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; picture to compare to really does show the difference.</li>
            <li> I feel rather stupid for believing the hype about how good this product was.  </li>
            <li> applied this treatment to the dark spots on my forehead, nose, and cheekbones on a regular basis (2x daily every day).</li>
            <li> After the third application I saw that my dark freckles were starting to lighten up</li>
            <li> I have been using this for one month with few results so far.  </li>
            <li> product did nothing on moles that I have had for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be using this brand for skin care needs in the future - it&#x27;s not available anywhere locally that I can find (not in WalMart, Target, etc), so Amazon has become the go to place to find it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been roughly two months of using this product several times a week</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair and pink skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That seems like a long time to wait</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle cure for brown spots, but it will help brown be lighter, for me some brown spots have disappeared but not completely, so this is a long term skin treatment months-a year.</li>
            <li> Ive suffered with acne for a long time now.</li>
            <li> It did take 3 months to see my hormone induced facial age spots fade a bit...and they are not really GONE...</li>
            <li> Strange...</li>
            <li> I get minor skin irritation after application</li>
            <li> It works, it just takes a really long time to fade out the spots.  </li>
            <li> This maybe alright for some minor areas</li>
            <li> Aside from that, the alpha hydroxy gradually removes the skin&#x27;s dead layers and leaves your face and neck with baby soft feel and look.</li>
            <li> i noticed a change within 3 days , but i was doubtful because before i have had good results , then things changed ....</li>
            <li> I do notice a slight peeling of the skin, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt and it&#x27;s nothing major.</li>
            <li> It is MUCH less noticeable now and seems to be fading even further with daily use.  </li>
            <li> Just be prepare for minor irritation!</li>
            <li> I believe the hormones from child birth made my skin between my upper lip and nose appear darker than my other skin</li>
            <li> I have been also using the lotion on other spots on my face, but the patch has appeared in only one spot.</li>
            <li> skin).&lt;br /&gt;It lasts incredibly long!</li>
            <li> All it did was made my skin dry and peel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, after applying thin layers of this product to my face on the affected areas yesterday, I literally noticed that the spots and flecks, which are light tan or brown and have been on my face for months now, faded within a few HOURS.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even rub it into my entire face as I don&#x27;t want my entire face to be white/pale--just a few spots.  </li>
            <li> I think I see a major difference in my dark spots in combination with other products I&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li> I apply a thin layer last thing at night and during the day I wear a high SPF cream, as I have done for a long time now.  </li>
            <li> It may have lightened unsure if I saw a difference , I &#x27;m trying Murad for dark spots ,I think my next try is the dermatologist</li>
            <li> Well after being put on hormones for health reasons and not following the \\&quot;DO NOT TAN\\&quot; rule, My forehead sprouted some dark spots almost overnight..</li>
            <li> But when I stopped, the spots healed and the dark spot (especially the biggest and darkest) had shrunk and were lighter.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t lighten your dark spots to the same (or close) skin color as the rest of your skin.</li>
            <li> I used the product for about three weeks, hoping it would lighten my dark spots - but it actually made them darker.</li>
            <li> I apply nearly every day and usually twice but not always.  </li>
            <li> It appears that on asian skin, it doesn&#x27;t always work well, can make dark spots DARKER.  </li>
            <li> The strength of the Hydroquinone was not enough to remove my dark spots.  </li>
            <li> Recently started using and see a difference in a dark spot on my leg.  </li>
            <li> i had some blemishes and some other dark spots which are now barely noticeable</li>
            <li> If you compare price by the ounce, it is much more expensive and works no better.  </li>
            <li> After a few months, I noticed a marked improvement in dark marks and scars in my neck area (ingrown hairs, ugh).</li>
            <li> But I am only half way through the tube</li>
            <li> I am half way through my second tube.  </li>
            <li> Occasionally, I felt a slight tingly sensation.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed a slight pinkish tint to the skin a couple times (which doesn&#x27;t last) but no irritation.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for about a week, and some of the dark spots have lightened a bit, but not as much as expected.</li>
            <li> i only apply a tiny portion to small spot in my face.</li>
            <li> Put a small amount on a few dark spots and it left those spots red and burned for nearly a week.  </li>
            <li> Also makes my skin very dry and peels a lot.</li>
            <li> What I didn&#x27;t like was it lighten my skin around the dark mark first than slowly start to lighten the dark mark, but it seem to work well for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I expected quick results, based on hype, and after 2-1/2 months of use, I wondered what was wrong.  </li>
            <li> For covering larger areas, I&#x27;ve used Estee Lauder&#x27;s Enlighten which seems to help brighten and even out my tone a little, but after my sample is gone</li>
            <li> It was a low grade peel, and my age spots did peel a little, but to keep this effect going, I got this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using it faithfully AM and pm for several weeks and have seen little improvement.</li>
            <li> I bought this product as I has a little dark pigmentation starting above my upper lip and small brown spot on my cheek bone...</li>
            <li> I am careful to cover the spot with sunblock every day.</li>
            <li> This is expected.</li>
            <li> If your skin get irritated from the product, just back off it for a few days.</li>
            <li> Did not really see any results after 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> The spots that got darker are on the left side of my face and I am wondering if the moments of harsh sun through my driver&#x27;s window are to blame.  </li>
            <li> but it does burn and I am not very fond of the smell (neither are the cats).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not much to lose.</li>
            <li> Not a real noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> the skin has pink under tones.  </li>
            <li> then i had expected.</li>
            <li> It made absolutely no difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be careful about using this around the neck and face.</li>
            <li> Use it sparingly and carefully.</li>
            <li> after a few days of use, my face was as red as a tomato from an allergic reaction....</li>
            <li> I believe them to have shown up (and then stayed) after my summer vacation last year, when I went to the beach a few times--</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had an issue with plucking chin hairs which has left me with HORRIBLE discoloration all over my chin, now I am african american (more of a caramel shade)</li>
            <li> The prescription (from a Plastic Surgeon) only cost me $20 and after a few applications, it&#x27;s already working.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So just be careful .</li>
            <li> It has a slight chemical smell to it but the results far outweigh that one small drawback.</li>
            <li> I applied a very small amount one night before going to bed and the next morning I woke up with a severe red rash with bumps and shiny skin.</li>
            <li> Has an incredibly strong odor of mildew making it impossible to use.</li>
            <li> but I also have freckles and its managed to fade both sooo much in such little time!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I had a very dark and large spot from sun damage under one of my eyebrows and tried a LOT of different products, including some expensive ons, which did not seem to help at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously treated these spots with lasers, Retin-A, and very expensive brightening creams with only mild results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it for spot treatment every other day for a week,  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is due to that one ingredient in this stuff that people warn against or what.</li>
            <li> I use a small amount with the AHA lotion from the same company.</li>
            <li> Maybe once my skin heals I&#x27;ll try it again but for the most part I was sadly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Want to try the other products</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on lightening / spot treatments due to some areas of acne scars on my face.  </li>
            <li> (not exactly the \\&quot;lightening\\&quot; effect I was expecting).  </li>
            <li> The product works faster than any other product that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t seem to be an issue mentioned in other reviews</li>
            <li> It is rated highly on other beauty sites I have visited.</li>
            <li> so maybe it just takes a lot of time like other brands I used but</li>
            <li> Also, does not cause breakouts, which has been a problem for me with other lightening products.</li>
            <li> But I used the entire small tube and</li>
            <li> For me, it was not worth the money I spent on it.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t usually leave reviews unless the product AMAZES me and this one definitely has.</li>
            <li> After using this Alpha Hydrox Spot Lightener a few months now, one of my big dark spot on my face is almost gone!</li>
            <li> For $10 this is less than I have spent on makeup at the store and ended up hating</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for only 4 days and today I woke up to find a dark hyper-pigmented patch on the side of my face where I have been using this lotion to get rid of two small spots.</li>
            <li> My spots are basically gone and I spent less than $13.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to try and get rid of liver spots on the back of my hands which have become worse over time.</li>
            <li> Not saying it can&#x27;t work for other people but definately was not for me, and just be very careful using this!</li>
            <li> I also had a larger freckle and a small scar that was just a slight pale pink color, so I decided to try it on those to see what happened.</li>
            <li> I am so determined to brighten my dark patches that I am putting up with smell.</li>
            <li> With sufficient use, the dark area becomes temporarily pink/red.</li>
            <li> This worked on my dark spots</li>
            <li> and i get dark marks after my acne clears.  </li>
            <li> Spots still there, dark as ever.</li>
            <li> This DOES work to lighten the dark spots.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about a month straight, and I have seen no results unfortunately.</li>
            <li> The staining from my sterling silver nose ring is still there and as dark as it always was.</li>
            <li> I had dark spots on my arms</li>
            <li> The dark spots remain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for 2 weeks and already see a noticeable fading of the dark spots on my face.  </li>
            <li> the really dark spots i think will not work-</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I rarely ever post reviews, unless i am REALLY UNHAPPY with something.  </li>
            <li> I had a hyper pigmented burn scar that was dark</li>
            <li> and I can already see some lightening of dark spots caused by sun damage and acne.  </li>
            <li> To my surprise, it got rid of a dark liver spot on my cheek.  </li>
            <li> now the spots are highly dark</li>
            <li> Two years of treatment and my dark spots remained visible with no noticeable change.</li>
            <li> This seems to be lightening my dark spots on my cheek</li>
            <li> I had a couple of dark spots on my legs, underarms and ankles from shaving (Which I know longer place a razer on my body)and</li>
            <li> So these two regimen helped my dark spots extreamly well...</li>
            <li> Used this for 5 months now ans there has been no effect on my dark circles, despite using a sunscreen with 40 spf</li>
            <li> I got this product because I have some dark spots on my face.  </li>
            <li> Dark spot lightener.  </li>
            <li> I often get dark spots on my skin from exposure to the sun because I use Retin A.  </li>
            <li> So far, I have not experienced any irritation from the cream.  </li>
            <li> I broke down and got prescription obagi and already noticed a change within a week.</li>
            <li> Plus with Aloe to clam the skin down.</li>
            <li> I am noticing results after only a few days!!</li>
            <li> and it has cut the shade down by half and also shrunk some of it.  </li>
            <li> Tried a few other things that haven&#x27;t worked, AT ALL, whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be very careful!</li>
            <li> I will definitely recommend this product I have been using mederma on my hyper-pigmentation scar with very slow not very noticeable results</li>
            <li> IT WILL STAIN YOUR SKIN TEMPORARILY BLACK.</li>
            <li> I might have noticed a slight bit of change but if you&#x27;re like me you want it gone like yesterday.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s supposed to feel slightly tingly and burning.</li>
            <li> slight downside is that after a week of use, the areas where I had been applying the cream were a sort of &#x27;raw&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Although the alpha hydroxy percentage is less.</li>
            <li> It made slight changes to the darkness of my age spots.</li>
            <li> I thought it might help, and maybe it did fade it slightly (???)</li>
            <li> AND A HALF</li>
            <li> My scar is now lighter than before and almost half way gone.  </li>
            <li> This is not a quick fix if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping for something that took less time.</li>
            <li> It seems as if my dark spots got lighter a little, but they did not disappear.</li>
            <li> do notice a \\&quot;warm\\&quot; feeling in my face after applying the product, and possibly some very slight redness, but I&#x27;m used to using Alpha Hydrox products and it doesn&#x27;t bother me in the least.</li>
            <li> Stinks to high heaven and has absolutely no effect on dark spots</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few dark sun spots on my face for years that were 90% lighter after 10 days of use.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m left to assume it spoiled at some point due to poor packaging.</li>
            <li> cream tingles a little when going on, which I sort of like because I feel like it is doing something.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received this product a little over a week ago.  </li>
            <li> the spots a little bit also.</li>
            <li> Besides a little redness and peeling, side effects were MINIMAL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After going years with little to no sunscreen on my fair-skinned face, I ended up with melasma patches on my forehead.</li>
            <li> Maybe a little lighter.</li>
            <li> So So just like any other lighter, just still not sure if I see any change or not.....</li>
            <li> Saw little or no results.</li>
            <li> ironically, this cream does the opposite of what it claims to do, at least for me!</li>
            <li> I only give it 4 stars because it is very slow...</li>
            <li> This did very little to lighten the dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying this stuff for few days</li>
            <li> A few days after that, I was washing my face and the areas that I had been using it on</li>
            <li> began to peel some when I dried my face with a towel, almost as if the stuff had loosened my skin somehow, I dont know.</li>
            <li> I want to lighten a few age spots.  </li>
            <li> i use this on and off, on one sun spot on my cheek i got after a sunburn a few yrs ago.</li>
            <li> Been using this a few weeks, and felt compelled to write a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> on a whim ordered this a few weeks ago, and 3 weeks in, its GONE.  </li>
            <li> I follow the directions on the bottle, and use faithfully everyday.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with this product - does not work</li>
            <li> If you want to avoid the burn effect, maybe try one week on and then a few days off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using this product twice a day, almost everyday, since I bought it in February.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait to review it until I had used it for a few months.</li>
            <li> The skin dried out so it needed to be exfoliated which probably help get rid of the darker skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks I stopped using it for reasons that had nothing to do with the product.</li>
            <li> I actually think it made it worse.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from on Amazon.com a few years ago and it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I used it for a few weeks and never noticed any difference with my skin.</li>
            <li> I noticed lighter age spots in just a few days.</li>
            <li> The stinging goes away after a few minutes</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money</li>
            <li> Maybe this is part of the process, but if so, i would have to plan on staying home for a few days to apply it as directed (twice a day).  </li>
            <li> I may try that, when I am going to be home for a few days.</li>
            <li> Made me feel like it would glare &amp;#34;look at me&amp;#34; but I feel hopeful with just a few days use.</li>
            <li> Other that that, you can hardly see the marks.</li>
            <li> I have a few sun spots/dark spots on my face and have tried several products (including the expensive Shiseido dark spot remover--which didn&#x27;t work for me).</li>
            <li> Alright, so this was to get rid of dark spots, or at least that is why I got it.</li>
            <li> However, I would purchase this again because at least the dark patches are lighter.</li>
            <li> Such scarring left me embarrassed, insecure, and hiding behind make up.</li>
            <li> IT, I had horrible hormonal acne for years (still experience it sometimes) which many, very dark acne marks.</li>
            <li> I just know that this was very strange and has put me in a worse position than I was before trying this stuff.</li>
            <li> Alas, it was just a dry patch.</li>
            <li> Product is slow to work and little change in spots was noticed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little slow but works well.</li>
            <li> so i use very little of it ..</li>
            <li> It really smells bad, though, like ammonia.</li>
            <li> Just a small amount every night and in a week or two you will see a difference.</li>
            <li> I did it 2x&#x27;s/day for a few months and it said to discontinue use after 3 months if it doesnt work!</li>
            <li> stings even in small portions</li>
            <li> and I am still not really sure how I feel.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it faithfully, morning and night, for many years, and managed to remove one very annoying &amp;#34;sun spot&amp;#34; from my face.  </li>
            <li> Give it about 30-60 seconds to soak in and then go about your usual moisturizing routine.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write a review about anything</li>
            <li> The small opening makes it easier for pin-point applications.  </li>
            <li> A small amount with each use leaves no evidence  of it.</li>
            <li> I used this for the past 3 weeks now</li>
            <li> This product is watery and smells worse than any other product I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> I have used numerous products to lighten dark spots including Clinique which is very expensive and takes up to 4 months.</li>
            <li> Just because I have an illness does not mean I have to look bad.</li>
            <li> My wife used it and her dark spot became worse.</li>
            <li> It was totally not worth it!!!</li>
            <li> However, the one thing that&#x27;s clear is that it smells bad.  </li>
            <li> it was inexpensive at least.</li>
            <li> it looked like a puzzle to say the least.</li>
            <li> At least I can tell this is working.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking that it would at least help...but it has \\&quot;really\\&quot; helped.  </li>
            <li> Takes time, don&#x27;t expect results before at least a month.</li>
            <li> I was shocked and amazed at early results.</li>
            <li> I think it requires at least 2 months of use to see any noticeable results.</li>
            <li> Maybe it has to work through layers slowly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never gotten any skin irritation, and it does lighten the spots, albeit slowly.</li>
            <li> that is slow but works gradually</li>
            <li> My skin was thick and swollen and irritated.</li>
            <li> However I do see it slowly peel the skin on my scars, but no fading of the scars.</li>
            <li> I think I will have them layered off at the dermatologist&#x27;s office and cover them with make-up in the mean time.</li>
            <li> and in just a few days of using it,I saw dramatic results.</li>
            <li> Anyway put very very small amount of it on in 4-5 spots.</li>
            <li> She prescribed a very expensive tiny tube of spot lightner.</li>
            <li> the the results are subtle.</li>
            <li> Once the infection cleared up with antibiotics, I was left with horrible red and brown marks from the boils and cysts.</li>
            <li> It will take a lot longer but this is the way to avoid serious irritation.</li>
            <li> and it wouldn&#x27;t be that bad if it didn&#x27;t leave spots that last 20 times longer.</li>
            <li> I have endured terrible facial scarring due to illness.</li>
            <li> I have some tough to get rid of Melasma on my face after a pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I then tried this one and within a few days the spot began to fade!!!  </li>
            <li> And in my case, I don&#x27;t have any white splotches or burn scars in place of the stupid spot.</li>
            <li> so I decided to use a thin layer all over my face  and see what happens    </li>
            <li> it wont get any worse and just go away.      </li>
            <li> I have been using it for approximately 7 weeks now.  </li>
            <li> I have not experienced any redness, skin irritation or itchiness</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any soreness, redness, itching or flaking where I&#x27;ve used it.  </li>
            <li> The patch is much worse than the two spots I have been trying to remove.</li>
            <li> I had dark spots due to birth control that were horrible and embarrassing.</li>
            <li> I am very stupid for buying this   more stupid for using this.  </li>
            <li> After pricing out Proactiv I decided that it was simply to expensive for the size of the bottle</li>
            <li> Forget expensive skin lighteners.</li>
            <li> I tried another well-known (expensive) fading cream that didn&#x27;t contain Retin-A.  </li>
            <li> Worse decision of my life!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had such horrible breakout ever in my life!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I cannot comment on the efficacy of the product, because it arrived with the bottom of the tube unsealed.</li>
            <li> no good!!</li>
            <li> It will make you break out horribly, even if you don&#x27;t currently have acne.</li>
            <li> just weird</li>
            <li> I started seeing an expensive dermatologist in 2012.</li>
            <li> and now it&#x27;s much worse!</li>
            <li> I became so desperate for it to do anything that I would apply it in the morning, followed by 50+ expensive sunblock, and 2-3x per night.</li>
            <li> It smells like a dirty laundry hamper at the gym.  </li>
            <li> but I am desperate to get rid of my brown patches and can&#x27;t afford to go to the dermatologist</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t seem to have any unpleasant side effects.  </li>
            <li> This product smells so bad</li>
            <li> Was just recovered from a bad breakout, had some hyperpigmentation so decided to use this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked this actualy works</li>
            <li> They dont hurt , just look ugly    </li>
            <li> Again, I am absolutely shocked and amazed.</li>
            <li> This just happend today! :(  </li>
            <li> It did nothing to help and I am disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I used this product according to the instructions but did not see any visible changes, was kinda disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with product.</li>
            <li> This cream is highly dangerous if you don&#x27;t patch test!</li>
            <li> Really disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Hate the smell.</li>
            <li> I hate reviewing products</li>
            <li> What a disappointment!!</li>
            <li> Stupid!</li>
            <li> AWFUL product, it does NOT work at all.</li>
            <li> horrible</li>
            <li> Horrible idea!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used hydroquinone and glycolic acid before with no problem, so I believe it may just be the oiliness of the product, but it has caused the worst outbreak I&#x27;ve had in years!</li>
            <li> It seems to work but smells awful.</li>
            <li> I saw no results after having suffered through the terrible smell.  </li>
            <li> It looks terrible!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Wife uses &amp; says it worked great for chest spots, not so great for her hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked this actualy works JUST DON&#x27;T MIX IT WITH BENZOYL PEROXIDE IT WILL STAIN YOUR SKIN TEMPORARILY BLACK. For me it worked better when i applied a thick layer saw results in one week would buy again, also avoid the sun for about 2 weeks to avoid skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I have some tough to get rid of Melasma on my face after a pregnancy. This did very little to lighten the dark spots on my face. I might have noticed a slight bit of change but if you&#x27;re like me you want it gone like yesterday. I broke down and got prescription obagi and already noticed a change within a week.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  Takes forever to work. Do better with any cheap product over the counter</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really do the job but with this price, I can&#x27;t expect too much.  I will not order this in future.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a bit over a month on a 1/2\\&quot; diameter spot of sun damage on the side of my face.  The spot has turned from light brown to light pink.  I will continue to use it because this will not go away overnight.  I am careful to cover the spot with sunblock every day.</li>
            <li> Within a week age spots on face and hands were much lighter.  After 3 weeks almost gone.  Works great for me.</li>
            <li> I feel rather stupid for believing the hype about how good this product was.  I should&#x27;ve checked the % Hydroquinone, which is 2%, the same as Porcelana.  If you compare price by the ounce, it is much more expensive and works no better.  I expected quick results, based on hype, and after 2-1/2 months of use, I wondered what was wrong.  Upon checking the % Hydroquinone, I realized it was no stronger than what I was using.  The only advantage to its being in a tube is that you don&#x27;t get the product under your fingernails, a problem with products in jars.</li>
            <li> It could VERY well just be my skin BUT..I&#x27;ve used this for 4 months and Nothing!!! I&#x27;ve just come to the conclusion its not for me...but I hope it works for you.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost a week and noticed my scars getting lighter after the third day. Great price and great product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a year now. Through trial and error I learned that less really is more. I suggest that you wash the area first with soap and water, then apply a small amount directly on the spot. In a couple of days you will notice the spot getting lighter and eventually fadeing. I even use it on blemishes or pimples and it dries them up overnight! I get compliments on my flawless skin almost everyday.</li>
            <li> I bought this product as I has a little dark pigmentation starting above my upper lip and small brown spot on my cheek bone...sun spots or rather tanning booth spots.  I read all the reviews and bought this product thinking it was the best of what was available over the counter.  Well, doesn&#x27;t work at all.  I followed the directions, putting it on twice a day and putting on sunscreen religiously.  Nothing changed. 3+ weeks and still no difference.  I am going to do a TCA peel and see if that will bring about the results I am looking for.  Bottom line save your money for a peel instead.</li>
            <li> This truly is a miracle cream...I swear within the first week I saw a noticeable difference!  I have had this darned brown spot on my face for a few years, and nothing screams ol&#x27; lady more than that!  I&#x27;ve been using it twice/day for about 5 weeks and it&#x27;s just about gone.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This cream really does lighten dark spots. I only give it 4 stars because it is very slow...but it does work!</li>
            <li> Really good product.  Helpful for senior ladies brown spots.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! Used it twice and my darks spots were significantly lighter!</li>
            <li> I am very stupid for buying this   more stupid for using this.  hydroquinone an ingredient in this product has evidence of being harmful.  AND it is banned everywhere but the u.s. almost.    I used it for spot treatment every other day for a week,  no results, i didnt want to put it all over my face for fear it might cause  some kind of skin problem (redness/peeling)  so I decided to use a thin layer all over my face  and see what happens    Wake up next day to discover  TWO bruise like spots on each side of my face, near my jaw  They dont hurt , just look ugly    i believe this is ochronosis.A disease that can be caused by hydroquinone  This just happend today! :(  I am only 21 years old and ocronosis is typically permanent.  I will stop permanent use and hopefully since i wont be using this product  it wont get any worse and just go away.      Please Do NOT use this product  I am going to write a letter to the FDA.</li>
            <li> I never received this product i sent a message stating it but to no reveal. I was charged for this product....</li>
            <li> If you can stand the stinky smell on your hands and area that you cover with Alpha Hydrox, then the product is fine. I am so determined to brighten my dark patches that I am putting up with smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Alpha Hydrox before and I seemed to recall it didn&#x27;t work before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t work on age spots really, but I had picked at a pimple a few months ago and it left a discolored spot on my cheek. I was going to buy souffle but picked this up instead as it was on super saver shipping. After a month or two of continuous use, I was pleasantly surprised the dark spot is completely gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s supposed to feel slightly tingly and burning. With sufficient use, the dark area becomes temporarily pink/red. Then it feels itchy as the skin heals. That&#x27;s the glycolic acid. When you first use it, you may feel and see no result. But after continued use, it will start to sting. Maybe it has to work through layers slowly. When you skin starts to heal, it will feel itchy. At this point, additional applications hurt a bit more so what I did was apply skin moisturizer on top. It also seemed to accelerate healing as the reddened area returned to normal skin color sooner.</li>
            <li> This worked on my dark spots but I had to apply it twice per day, generously right on the spot. Make sure if you are in the sun that you use sunscreen or the spots come back.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for one month with few results so far.  I&#x27;ll keep at it.  It may just take time, if it works at all.</li>
            <li> Effectiveness seems to depend on what it is applied to.&lt;br /&gt;Some skin spots rapidly disappear altogether. Some take longer and some are barely affected.&lt;br /&gt;So, it might or might not work for you.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend trying it.  For the price, it might be worth it.</li>
            <li> I had two dark age spots right on the bridge of my nose, under my glasses and they really bothered me.  I don&#x27;t wear make-up very often and it doesn&#x27;t cover them very well anyway, so the spots glared at me every time I looked in the mirror. My son-in-law even noticed and asked if I&#x27;d bruised myself.  I decided to give this product a try, just hoping that it would reduce the spots enough to cover with make-up on.  I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks now and I love it!  Both spots have significantly lightened and one is almost gone completely. I do notice a slight peeling of the skin, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt and it&#x27;s nothing major. I would recommend this to anyone who wishes to lighten or get rid of age spots.  It works.</li>
            <li> I am very fair skined and had a few brown spots that have faded very well over the last few weeks. The trick is to be patient!!! If you glob it on it will burn your skin. Just a small amount every night and in a week or two you will see a difference. Happy Mommy in Cali.</li>
            <li> Stinks to high heaven and has absolutely no effect on dark spots</li>
            <li> Order came when it should and order is exactly what and how it was described to be I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I just turned 40 and started noticing small pea sized brown spots on my fair, normal skin.  Within one day of using this cream (twice a day) I noticed fading.  Within 4 days, some of the spots were completely gone and with a week all of the new age spots were gone!!  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream tingles a little when going on, which I sort of like because I feel like it is doing something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One slight downside is that after a week of use, the areas where I had been applying the cream were a sort of &#x27;raw&amp;#34;.  It looked like a sun burn or rug burn.  Nothing that couldn&#x27;t be covered up with make up and it didn&#x27;t really hurt.  But when using I would be careful to only apply to the specific area you are trying to lighten, and not get too generous (like I did the first time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product did nothing on moles that I have had for a long time.  But on the newer age spots, it was incredible, especially for the price!  I use other products by this brand and love them, but this one really impressed me!</li>
            <li> This, in conjuction with my BHA 2% daily peel, has helped my hyperpigmentation so much.  I&#x27;ve already ordered another tube that&#x27;s waiting in the wings to be used.</li>
            <li> This product definitely works but you have to use it consistently over several weeks. I have seen significant improvement in the lightening of my dark spots. I really like the applicator tip because it applies it directly on to the spot.</li>
            <li> AWFUL product, it does NOT work at all. DO NOT waste your money.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the positive reviews, and all I can say is that I&#x27;m glad it was so cheap. All it did was made my skin dry and peel. It worked, somewhat, but not enough. Maybe I&#x27;ll try a more natural product.</li>
            <li> I like it no complaints I came when it said it would and I cant really argue with that at all</li>
            <li> I saw this on Dr. Oz and decided to give it a try. I have lots of sun spots all over my face and I wanted to try this to see if it would help lighten them up. In the time that I used it, when I used it, it did not work. It smells pretty potent and sometimes it burns a little. Maybe I wasnt applying it religiously enough...I did it 2x&#x27;s/day for a few months and it said to discontinue use after 3 months if it doesnt work! I will revisit this product again soon since I still have some left. This time I will apply it 3 times and if I have results I will come back and update my review. Good thing though...it was inexpensive at least.</li>
            <li> Nice product. it works and it smells nice; also it is a great alternative to&lt;br /&gt;many similar ones that are not as good. It really helps the skin to lighten&lt;br /&gt;evenly and nicely. It is easy to apply on your skin. The instructions are&lt;br /&gt;very clear. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> For a decade, I&#x27;ve been plagued with mild acne since I was a teenager (I have fair, relatively sensitive asian skin).  The blemishes themselves wouldn&#x27;t be too big a deal if it weren&#x27;t for the unsightly brown spot each would leave after it had begun to heal.  The scar itself would last 10 times longer than the pimple, not completely fading for months at time.  As a result, just 1-3 new pimples every day would eventually yield a face covered in brown spots on my forehead, cheeks and chin.    I received this product a little over a week ago.  I initially used it twice a day, following instructions.  After the first day, my skin reacted by hyper-secreting oils, and the whole areas where I applied the product looked darker, like I had been under the sun tanning. My skin settled after about 4 days of using it, and I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin has become smoother and brighter when I awoke in the mornings (it&#x27;s apparently inhibitting the formation of new blemishes and blackheads too!). I even had some new scars that faded and are practically invisible now after just 3 days!! I reduced the use to once in the evening before bed (I recommend applying sparingly on clean, dry skin right after cleansing--just right on the spots), and applied just moisturizer and sunscreen during the day, as I believe exposing your skin to sunrays with the product on your face causes hyper-pigmentation of the skin.    I&#x27;m on about my seventh day, and so far so good.  Today my brown spots have faded to a pink color, and some have already disappeared completely.  It&#x27;s slowly erasing the flaws one by one, and I&#x27;m starting to see the real me!!  I&#x27;m absolutely thrilled at how fast this is working.  I&#x27;m so excited and I&#x27;m certain that by 4 weeks or so my skin will finally be flawless!  The results this product have delivered has been a wish fulfilled for me. :)  Just be patient with it--I definitely recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> I had a few major coppery brown freckles that were getting out of hand, especially one on the cheekbone below my left iris. It was starting to look like  the state of Texas. The hydroquinone and 10% glycolic acid formula in Spot Light is right on the money. It&#x27;s at least as good as the Murad dark spot treatment, and they work in about the same amount of time - two weeks for me, applying twice a day in the beginning and taking a break if there seems to be irritation. I just use a toothpick and magnifying mirror to apply the cream in as targeted a way as possible because you&#x27;ll get a temporary halo of redness around the spot. In other words, it can look slightly worse before it gets better. One minor drawback is that it contains mineral oil which causes breakouts on me, but it&#x27;s not a major issue because I apply it in dots. For covering larger areas, I&#x27;ve used Estee Lauder&#x27;s Enlighten which seems to help brighten and even out my tone a little, but after my sample is gone I wouldn&#x27;t actually purchase that product. Ambi fade cream doesn&#x27;t do anything at all for my freckle/spot concerns. Alpha Hydrox Spot Light is the best value out there for my needs; I just wish I&#x27;d found it ages ago.</li>
            <li> I saw this  on Dr Oz show and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  After a couple weeks my age spots are definitely lighter.  I will continue to use it and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Alright, so this was to get rid of dark spots, or at least that is why I got it. It took a while to find something that looked buyable. I&#x27;ve been trying this stuff for few days and I noticed something kind of strange happening. I used it twice a day, for yes, about a week. Then I noticed it starting to work, things got lighter. A few days after that, I was washing my face and the areas that I had been using it on began to peel some when I dried my face with a towel, almost as if the stuff had loosened my skin somehow, I dont know. Anyways, its left these red marks and they won&#x27;t go away. I don&#x27;t know if this is due to that one ingredient in this stuff that people warn against or what. I just know that this was very strange and has put me in a worse position than I was before trying this stuff. I dont think I could recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I purchased this from a local drug store.  I&#x27;m light - med combination skin and i get dark marks after my acne clears.  It did not fade at all with this product.  The cheaper stuff (Porcelana) with hydroquinone worked far better for me</li>
            <li> I love Alpha Hydroxy brand.  I have been using the glycolic for a year.  The label says to use this for a couple of months to see results.  I have been using it on my hands twice a day for two weeks now.  I want to lighten a few age spots.  I can see the skin in the area I have been applying it getting lighter and the spots a little bit also. I cannot tell yet if the spots will become significantly lighter or not.  They haven&#x27;t yet.  I think it takes a while and the the results are subtle.</li>
            <li> I have recently been in Asia for 2 weeks and I have to say that It shows on my face. My dark spots are much darker and before. After 2 weeks of going back to this cream, My dark spots are much lighter. I can tell bc After a light application of my regular bb cream, I cant see them anymore!</li>
            <li> It may have lightened unsure if I saw a difference , I &#x27;m trying Murad for dark spots ,I think my next try is the dermatologist</li>
            <li> Good product to fade dark spots/melasma</li>
            <li> I think I see a major difference in my dark spots in combination with other products I&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li> This is the best skin lightener I have ever used.  I saw results after using it just one time.  I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> My skin was very soft. Did not lighten a dang thang.</li>
            <li> This product is really something; it helped me get rid of all my acne scars. Do not be alarmed when using if your skin turns red. This is expected. After it turns red, discontinue treatment and wait for it to fade. Then exfoliate. Your skin will look brand new!</li>
            <li> Not working at all. I got some pigmentation over my upper lip after one fateful winter in Brazil, and I got this hoping it will help. Not at all. Did not whiten an inch of that pigmentation. Not sure then what kind of &amp;#34;spots&amp;#34; it is supposed to whiten then...</li>
            <li> Its a great product for dark spots that are not too dark. The results take a while also. However, the price is great so again its ok.</li>
            <li> Works fairly well on spots and has lightened many of my targeted hyperpigmented areas, though some not completely.</li>
            <li> This product got rid of dark spots on my face and top of my hands.  I used it twice a day.  Would buy again but the shipping cost more than the product.</li>
            <li> I used this for some sun spots on my forehead. The only thing it did was make my skin peel. Spots still there, dark as ever.</li>
            <li> Well after being put on hormones for health reasons and not following the \\&quot;DO NOT TAN\\&quot; rule, My forehead sprouted some dark spots almost overnight..it looked like a puzzle to say the least. I didn&#x27;t even want to leave my house, nor did I want to stop tanning. So I found this product and got it mainly because it was cheap, hoping it would help. Half a tube gone, and a month later my forehead is almost COMPLETELY back to normal...this stuff is amazing!!! I&#x27;m still tanning (horrible I know) on the medicine causing the spots but this stuff is taking care of them asap..If you have sunspots, acne scars, any discoloration I HIGHLY recommend this product!! I am extremely fair skinned so these spots were BAD and it still got rid of them!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product through Amazon about 8 weeks ago.  I have been using it for approximately 7 weeks now.  I haven&#x27;t been religious about using it twice a day, but use it twice a day on most days.  I use it on the sunspots on my face as well as a couple on the decollete area.  The spots on my are not completely gone yet, but are vastly reduced in appearance. The spots on my decollete are almost completely gone.  An amazing product for an amazing price.</li>
            <li> I have used obagi for years (always hating how much it cost). I was watching Dr. Oz and they talk about alpha hydrox spot light. I ordered it that day to see how good it was for only $10.00. It works great. Just as good, if not better than obagi. I am so happy about the money that I am going to be saving.</li>
            <li> I love this product. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it. I&#x27;ve never gotten any skin irritation, and it does lighten the spots, albeit slowly. In fact, it can be so hard to see from day to day that you think it isn&#x27;t working, so taking a &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; picture to compare to really does show the difference. My sun spots haven&#x27;t disappeared, but they&#x27;re definitely lighter than they were, and I&#x27;m only halfway through the tube.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for less than a month and my dark spots on my face and neck have been significantly reduced. I have brown skin and oily face (T-zone). I use a small amount with the AHA lotion from the same company. My skin&#x27;s texture and appearance have improved with the area being smoother, brighter, and clearer. I have even stopped using foundation/decrease my use of foundation, which I used to primarily cover blemishes. I am pretty happy with this product. I prefer the lotion since the lightener does contain hydroquinone so protect your skin from sun if you use this. I have also used this one my belly. The area is smoother still waiting for the spots to lighten though.</li>
            <li> This DOES work to lighten the dark spots. It really smells bad, though, like ammonia. You can put it on an hour or so before bed, let the smell dissipate and then go to sleep. Be sure to wear serious sunscreen of the dark spots come right back.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would finally be the product that worked for me. I used it continuously for about 5 days and I ended up with so much irration, dry skin, and redness on the spots I used it in. It hurt a lot and I just had to stop using it. Maybe once my skin heals I&#x27;ll try it again but for the most part I was sadly disappointed.</li>
            <li> This products seems to work at a pace of it&#x27;s own. What I didn&#x27;t like was it lighten my skin around the dark mark first than slowly start to lighten the dark mark, but it seem to work well for my daughter. Everybody skin is different. Like so many products, it&#x27;s trial and error. I wouldn&#x27;t discourage anyone from not purchasing because it may work for you.</li>
            <li> i use this on and off, on one sun spot on my cheek i got after a sunburn a few yrs ago. maybe this doesnt work or maybe that spot is resistant. i will have to give it more time.</li>
            <li> This is the best product that I have ever used to fade sun spots... works great.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on the top of my hands for just 2 weeks and am very pleased with the results so far!!!  I have used Alpha Hydrox 10% on my face before but this is the first time I ever tried using any AHA&#x27;s let alone Hydroquinone on my hands.  I was worried it might dehydrate them but this has not happened at all.  I apply a thin layer last thing at night and during the day I wear a high SPF cream, as I have done for a long time now.  I have (or rather had) some very obvious age/liver spots and an area near my thumb has a patch of what looks like melasma.  This patch is much lighter now.  I never expected this cream to make such a difference but am happy to say that the skin is looking overall smoother and clearer.  I have not experienced any redness, skin irritation or itchiness so I shall very likely repurchase.</li>
            <li> This item did not lighten any of the sun spots on my face or chest. I used it every morning and night for 3 months and there was no difference at all. I guess the price was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> Been using this a few weeks, and felt compelled to write a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can I say how AWESOME this stuff is?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A dark spot emerged a couple years ago right on the end of my FREAKIN&#x27; nose and has been a bane of mine since then.  Tried a few other things that haven&#x27;t worked, AT ALL, whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So on a whim ordered this a few weeks ago, and 3 weeks in, its GONE.  Gone, gone, gone. (Mostly, like have to put my face 3 inches from the mirror to see any discoloration)  Besides a little redness and peeling, side effects were MINIMAL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t sing the praise of this stuff any better, it works, damn good.  AND...its damn cheap.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY recommended.</li>
            <li> This got rid of almost all of a huge long age spot on my forehead.  It was so large people sometimes asked me if it was a birth mark.  You have to use this consistently for it to work.  Won&#x27;t erase your age spots overnight.  Also, it&#x27;s pretty strong, so I always give my face a break from using it at least one or two days a week.  This works and is MUCH cheaper than what a doctor prescribed to me that didn&#x27;t work at all for my age spots.</li>
            <li> stings even in small portions&lt;br /&gt;left redness but disappears in the morning</li>
            <li> I have been using this creme for about 6 months and I really haven&#x27;t seen much difference. I follow the directions on the bottle, and use faithfully everyday. It seems as if my dark spots got lighter a little, but they did not disappear. I don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing it again, once this bottle is gone.</li>
            <li> This product works. As long as you are diligent about applying twice daily. And then don&#x27;t forget to wear sunscreen and extra moisturizer over the areas you are treating. Brown spots fade to almost nothing!!</li>
            <li> After a few months, I noticed a marked improvement in dark marks and scars in my neck area (ingrown hairs, ugh). Use sparingly as it is a spot treatment and you don&#x27;t want to over-lighten.</li>
            <li> This year I got my first age spot on my face.  All of a sudden it was there...a big brown blotch right on my cheek.  Unsightly.  I&#x27;ve only used this item a few times since I purchased it, and already the blotch has faded considerably.  I have not experienced any soreness, redness, itching or flaking where I&#x27;ve used it.  I&#x27;d say it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery and good price. Still waiting to see results. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks. It feels like its working - it tingles.</li>
            <li> Really works, just after 8-10 applications I notices a difference. But be sure to use sunscreen when you are in the sun afterwards.</li>
            <li> I cant stop using thiis stuff..clears up my skin so its more of an even tone. Want to try the other products</li>
            <li> It works for me!! I have brown skin complexion and I was getting dark marks around my smile lines after I got off birth control. I thought I&#x27;d never get rid of it, after trying so many products. After two weeks I noticeably saw a difference. So happy, my confidence is back through the roof. If your skin get irritated from the product, just back off it for a few days. A little goes a long way and is a reasonable price product.</li>
            <li> This product smells so bad I can&#x27;t use it, therefore I can&#x27;t say weather it works or not.  It smells like cat urine...</li>
            <li> I started using right away . I have to wait to see the results . I hope it does work cause I been looking for something like this.</li>
            <li> .... Let&#x27;s be real:  How did you think you were going to get rid of those skin spots?  This product chemically eats away at your skin and the new cells that grow replace the darkened area.  I&#x27;ve used it for over a week and then my skin got too sore to continue.  But when I stopped, the spots healed and the dark spot (especially the biggest and darkest) had shrunk and were lighter.  I&#x27;m now starting round two, and I anticipate a few more iterations after this.  This product gets five stars because it works and is reasonably priced. If you want an option without pain, consider laser treatment at a doctor&#x27;s office, but if you are willing to put up with some uncomfortableness, and use common sense (stop if the skin is too irritated and let it heal), then this is a viable option.</li>
            <li> FIVE STARS!!!&lt;br /&gt;really good stuff! Just be prepare for minor irritation! I got really good results after 4 weeks of consecutive use at bed time!</li>
            <li> I have used this for about a month straight, and I have seen no results unfortunately. If anything, my darkened spots on my face have actually gotten darker. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product as it doesn&#x27;t do &amp;#34;it&#x27;s job&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have been using the Alpha Hydrox Spot Light Targeted Skin Lightener for a month.  I do feel that the product is working.  The brown age spots on my face seem to be getting lighter.  I don&#x27;t seem to have any unpleasant side effects.  I will continue to use it and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> This works fast!! I am noticing results after only a few days!! I am very pleased. I was using Ambi Cream but this product is much better.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on lightening / spot treatments due to some areas of acne scars on my face.  After pricing out Proactiv I decided that it was simply to expensive for the size of the bottle and the reviews weren&#x27;t that great either.  I am very pleased that I purchased this product instead and it works great and for the price it&#x27;s most definitely worth it.  I have not been able to use regularly but can certainly tell a difference after the few days to a week that I was able to apply it.  It&#x27;s best used when you can go without make-up, which I did for a week (scary!!!), but I don&#x27;t use it under makeup because it does have a little bit more of a substance to it and doesn&#x27;t absorb completely.  It has a lotion like feel and that&#x27;s not something I am going to attempt to put foundation on.  For $10 this is less than I have spent on makeup at the store and ended up hating so I give this little product a huge thumbs up for price, effectiveness, size and all of the above.</li>
            <li> Did not really see any results after 2 weeks of use. I probably should have stuck it out longer...The smell is fine and the texture is light and almost gel like</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really lighten the area I have on my skin. The staining from my sterling silver nose ring is still there and as dark as it always was. I used this product for about 3 months and noticed no difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did arrive in a timely fashion though and in mint condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a tip too: Never use sterling silver jewelry that goes on your face, go with stainless steel.</li>
            <li> This product works fine, I have super sensitive skin so I had to discontinue use of it, but the spots had nearly disappeared before I developed a reaction.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for three weeks now and I am still not really sure how I feel.  The first week one of my freckles loosened up and peeled right off (not exactly the \\&quot;lightening\\&quot; effect I was expecting).  As of yesterday, I noticed that one other freckle has gotten DARKER, and the rest of my spots have experienced no change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While using this product I have been avoiding the sun as much as possible and using high SPF when it is unavoidable.  The spots that got darker are on the left side of my face and I am wondering if the moments of harsh sun through my driver&#x27;s window are to blame.  I might try to wear band-aids while driving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to continue using this product for another two or three weeks to see what happens and (if I remember) will update my review at that time.</li>
            <li> Forget expensive skin lighteners. This miracle is the best thing ever. With only using it for three weeks, my skin is better and the brown spots are just going away. Great product!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with this product - does not work</li>
            <li> Got it real fast.  The product works faster than any other product that I have tried.  Believe me when I say I have tried many, from the most expensive to the lowest priced.  When choosing products, money is not the option.  What I want is that the product deliver on what it says that it will do.  Sometimes the most expensive with the most hype is the trashiest on delivery.  This product however,  within a days I began to see some difference which inspired me to continue and be regular and consistent with application.  This brought even better results.  Still a long way to go to get what I want to see which is the spots gone entirely.  But I am only half way through the tube so let us see how it goes by the time the tube is finished and I will update my review.&lt;br /&gt;I promised to give a further review, so here it is:  I have been using this product twice daily for two months now.  I am half way through my second tube.  I am pleased to say that this product is working so well for me. The two largest spots on my face which I named archipelago and figure-eight because this is exactly what they looked like; have faded so much that I can now see my face, where before I did not see &#x27;the forest for the trees&#x27; - meaning when I looked at myself in a mirror all I saw were archipelago and figure-eight. Although they have not quite gone - they are like ghostly remnants and the smaller ones have gone. I have stopped using concealers and foundation, because I am so happy with the results. My skin texture has gone through an unremarkable change as well, more like the covered skin under my shirt, soft and glowing. I now go bare with just my sunscreen on my face and use the product only at night now. I will continue to use this product until archipelago and figure-eight have totally disappeared. For those who experienced a redness in the spot area in the beginning, I experienced the same but persevered and the redness eventually faded.  I do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few dark sun spots on my face for years that were 90% lighter after 10 days of use. I&#x27;ve previously treated these spots with lasers, Retin-A, and very expensive brightening creams with only mild results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The process wasn&#x27;t pretty - my skin is pretty sensitive so it turned red for an hour or so each time I applied the cream. After about 10 days, one spot looked as if I&#x27;d mildly burned myself with a curling iron. Then it peeled off and the spot magically went with it. I am thrilled that such an inexpensive cream is so effective and so FAST! If you want to avoid the burn effect, maybe try one week on and then a few days off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some toxicity concerns with using hydroquinone so this was a last ditch effort. My esthetician advised to never to use this for more than a 30 day stretch so I opted to use it only on my darkest spots for a short period of time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any freckles or scars on my face, but I wanted to simply whiten an area where a healed an already old pimple area was. At first, it made my skin red with it&#x27;s burning sensation, and I thought it was working it&#x27;s stuff but instead, it simply caused an injury to that area. When it healed, it caused a even darker spot there, almost like mole!!! Now I have two spots on my face! Stupid! I shouldn&#x27;t have used this thing!!</li>
            <li> really didn&#x27;t notice any skin lightening for me. maybe for someone else it works better but i definitely threw it away and wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> This really works but it takes a lot of time and patience.  I&#x27;ve used it faithfully, morning and night, for many years, and managed to remove one very annoying &amp;#34;sun spot&amp;#34; from my face.  Two others really wanted to come out and it&#x27;s keeping them from emerging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then I  developed more of those lovely spots on my face and grew impatient and tried prescription Retin-A cream.  It literally burnt my skin badly enough for the Dermatologist to ask me how I got burnt!  Obviously, I&#x27;m allergic to Retin-A.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried another well-known (expensive) fading cream that didn&#x27;t contain Retin-A.  That cream not only didn&#x27;t make my age spots lighten, it lightened the entire area around them so that they&#x27;re kind of highlighted with a nice round, light circle, especially on my neck. And I have a very light, Irish complexion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was enough for me and I&#x27;m back to my Alpha Hydrox Lightener that is slow but works gradually and it doesn&#x27;t leave any other light marks on my skin as it lightens the wretched spots~ but it does require patience.  Put it on the spots after you wash your face, morning and night.  Give it about 30-60 seconds to soak in and then go about your usual moisturizing routine.  In time, you&#x27;ll be amazed when you discover a spot has pretty much disappeared!  And in my case, I don&#x27;t have any white splotches or burn scars in place of the stupid spot. Oh, and just to be safe, I still put a little on the spots that have almost faded to nothing.  You don&#x27;t need to use much of this cream so why not be safe rather than sorry?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck - have patience - and remember your sun screen!</li>
            <li> The price of this product made me skeptical, but I was so happy with it!  I will definitely be using this brand for skin care needs in the future - it&#x27;s not available anywhere locally that I can find (not in WalMart, Target, etc), so Amazon has become the go to place to find it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lightener helps with overall skin tone and texture - I saw and felt a difference literally overnight the first time I used it.  I&#x27;ve used it for several months in conjunction with daily sunblock and do see a difference in tone.</li>
            <li> Had some discoloration cause by skin cancer removal and this over time did the trick. Ordered two more so why stop a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Was just recovered from a bad breakout, had some hyperpigmentation so decided to use this. Worse decision of my life! Barely used any of it (didn&#x27;t spot test, and I regret it immensely). Anyway put very very small amount of it on in 4-5 spots. Got badly burned bright bright red that didn&#x27;t subside for 1-2 weeks! On top of that made me break out super bad! Haven&#x27;t had such horrible breakout ever in my life! Still recovering from the aftermath. After redness went away, skin peeled off, and reveal even DARKER hyperpigmentation underneath. I used sunscreen and avoided the sun religiously as directed. Not saying it can&#x27;t work for other people but definately was not for me, and just be very careful using this!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I cannot comment on the efficacy of the product, because it arrived with the bottom of the tube unsealed. Has an incredibly strong odor of mildew making it impossible to use. The smell doesn&#x27;t seem to be an issue mentioned in other reviews so I&#x27;m left to assume it spoiled at some point due to poor packaging.</li>
            <li> great products. Thanks</li>
            <li> Didnt do anything for my acne scars on my shoulders. Maybe its more effective on lighter skinned persons.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it will actually work on the fading yet but it does burn and I am not very fond of the smell (neither are the cats).&lt;br /&gt;Although the alpha hydroxy percentage is less. I think I will stick with Kiss My Face Peaches &amp; Cream Ultra Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Did not work as good as I thought it would, but will keep using,&lt;br /&gt;the price was great. But will not buy again....</li>
            <li> Went through the whole tube and it didn&#x27;t seem to change a thing.  I&#x27;m now using real lemon juice on a cotton ball and it&#x27;s seems to be doing a great job.</li>
            <li> I used it once a day for almost every day. After about two weeks, my age spot was completely gone. I also had a larger freckle and a small scar that was just a slight pale pink color, so I decided to try it on those to see what happened. It did not work on either the freckle or scar.</li>
            <li> Great product - does work in lightening the dark spots on my face.  The product does tingle a bit when you first put it on but nothing serious.  Thrilled that the spots are getting lighter!  Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy, it work&#x27;s. My face is getting well every day.I would recomend for my friend.****** ******* ******* ***</li>
            <li> I decided to write a review because I want the world to know that this product is amazing. I am going to order three more tubes. I had dark spots on my arms and I tried this product. Within a week i noticed that the spots started to fade and some were actually gone. I believe one more tube will make them dissapear for good!!!!!</li>
            <li> I just started using this and almost immediately saw results.I had been using 10% Alpha hydrox cream for a few weeks and wasnt happy with the initial condition of my skin(I know it gets better later).That cream actually seems to cause hyperpigmentation as it dries out my skin.  When I added this,I saw immediate results.As in,I went to bed and awoke to lighter acne scars.Not gone,but I can see it is working.  I have used Alpha Hydrox on and off for years and always come back.I did not hesitate to try this as their products have always been effective and economical.Ive tried alot of products over the years,so I know the good and the bad.  Im really thrilled that they make this cream and Ive just ordered 3 more.  This is only second to Dr.Varons skin bleaching or Mederma.Both of those are more expensive.so Ill stick to this.</li>
            <li> been using it for a month now and I have noticed a difference on a dark spot near my thigh as it has indeed gotten lighter! most people expect a magic product that works over night but this has worked okay for the price and time.</li>
            <li> At least I can tell this is working. My age spots are fading one almost gone.&lt;br /&gt;Buy things here don&#x27;t even think about walmart or CVS. Better prices here. A lot better.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Save your money.</li>
            <li> I never had much of a chance to see any difference while using this product.  I would often forget to use it because I didn&#x27;t want for it to react with anything else I used so I didn&#x27;t use it much.  So I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s fair for me to pass any sort of judgement on it.  I had wanted to use it on a crop of freckles on my nose that were cute when I was 12, but now they just look like smudges of dirt.  I should have tried more to use it.</li>
            <li> After going years with little to no sunscreen on my fair-skinned face, I ended up with melasma patches on my forehead. I have sensitive skin and was concerned this would burn, but only experienced the slightest amount of tingle right after applying it. It&#x27;s been roughly two months of using this product several times a week and my patches are almost GONE! :) I found this product after searching through http://www.paulaschoice.com/beautypedia/</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe any of these skin lightening creams and ointments actually do anything. Well, maybe they add structure to your day, by extending your morning or evening toilette, but I&#x27;d rather be drinking a martini or watching Netflix or salting slugs than spending extra time in front of the mirror. But that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product twice a day, almost everyday, since I bought it in February. I wanted to wait to review it until I had used it for a few months. I had two prominent brown patches on one cheek and another one on my other cheek. I definitely can see that they have lightened. You have to be persistent to see results. I keep my tube next to my bathroom sink to help me remember to apply it on a consistent basis. Very good product for the money. It is rated highly on other beauty sites I have visited.</li>
            <li> I have used numerous products to lighten dark spots including Clinique which is very expensive and takes up to 4 months. Used it for a month and saw no results. Started using this stuff and saw results in one week. It&#x27;s now two weeks and I love this product. It really works. I don&#x27;t usually write a review about anything but it has taken me a while to find something that really does what it is supposed to do. I am impressed.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this for the 8 weeks so maybe it just takes a lot of time like other brands I used but for the price this is good. Goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t have much smell and isn&#x27;t greasy like others. I am planning on getting again and seeing what long-term use does. I have seen smaller lighter spots fade but I have one that is larger and darker which is still there. Maybe a little lighter. I would say to give it a try. Not much to lose.</li>
            <li> This product left all of the blemishes that I had applied it on very red and irritated. Dealing with my blemishes was nothing compared to trying to cover up the red splotches that I had all over my face after an overnight treatment.  What a disappointment!!</li>
            <li> Well, I guess going from brown spots to bright red is a bit lighter.  It took weeks of vitamin E cream to get the red spots back to normal...aka brown.  This stuff is garbage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying the product out and understand it takes a while to show results.  However, the one thing that&#x27;s clear is that it smells bad.  It smells like a dirty laundry hamper at the gym.  I can&#x27;t explain why, but it&#x27;s real.  I only hope it doesn&#x27;t smell once you apply it!?!?!</li>
            <li> The tube was split on the end so every time you open to use it, product comes out the back end.  Now it&#x27;s prone to drying up- no good!!</li>
            <li> It made slight changes to the darkness of my age spots. Doesn&#x27;t smell great and feels a little greasy. May try another product and then decide if I want to keep using this one.</li>
            <li> Worked very well, faded the spots on my skin considerably but took about three weeks to be visible</li>
            <li> Used daily, this really helps with age spots.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product as I was looking for a skin lightener to help fade marks from a recent staph infection. My infection was originally folliculitis, which causes tiny acne-like pimples to form in the infected area. Believing these to be acne, I treated them with acne wash which irritated and spread them, eventually causing staph which resulted in infected and inflamed boils and cysts all along the front of my neck. Once the infection cleared up with antibiotics, I was left with horrible red and brown marks from the boils and cysts. I&#x27;ve been using this product daily for over a week and the marks have faded tremendously. They&#x27;re still there, and I&#x27;m sure it will take time for it to heal completely, but so far the results are great. Tiny brown marks, the size of moles or freckles, seemed to get darker, scab over, then fall off, leaving a fresh pinkish area that slowly fades into the rest of the skin. Larger red marks, the size of about a pea, just gradually fade to a lighter pink. However, I decided to also use this on my face for some old red marks left from old acne. Horrible idea! I&#x27;ve used hydroquinone and glycolic acid before with no problem, so I believe it may just be the oiliness of the product, but it has caused the worst outbreak I&#x27;ve had in years! My face is covered in tiny, red, inflamed pimples (acne pimples, not folliculitis pimples). It also burned my face, left it very red, but did help to lighten old marks. However, I&#x27;ll probably have new marks to deal with now thanks to this! By the way, if you have sensitive skin, as I do, don&#x27;t use twice a day, only use once at night before bed and only use a small amount. Too much causes redness and peeling. And if you have acne prone skin, DO NOT use this product. It will make you break out horribly, even if you don&#x27;t currently have acne. To sum it up, I gave this product 3 stars although I really rate it 2 1/2. Does wonderfully for marks on the body, but causes hell on the face. This product is good, but seems to be a bit strong for those with sensitive skin. If you decide to use, test it first before diving head-first. Judging by my own experience and the other reviews, this seems to be a hit or miss product, either hitting bullseye and doing perfect or missing off the chart and either doing absolutely nothing or making matters even worse.</li>
            <li> Works decent on new dark spots. Old ones take time, but it works! Smell is not so pleasant, but you get used to it. Non-greasy which is a plus.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in the hope that I would eventually find a product that would minimize some sun damage spots on my face.  So far, everything else I&#x27;ve tried has had no impact.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m applying this twice daily per the instructions.  It has actually eliminated some of the minor spots.  It seems to be reducing the the darker ones.  I&#x27;m continuing in the hope that the improvement will continue.  It can cause a bit of redness sometimes but nothing too noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s reasonably priced and seems to be working.  I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> So So just like any other lighter, just still not sure if I see any change or not.....</li>
            <li> It seems to work but smells awful.</li>
            <li> The small opening makes it easier for pin-point applications.  I apply a dot every 4-5 days, and the spots do get lighter.  When I applied this product on back-back days, I got red scabbing.  I have blonde hair and pink skin.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, you definitely have to keep at it though.  Expect to apply for several weeks for results, not overnight.</li>
            <li> This product works really well which is why I purchased again.  No further comments as I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my skin</li>
            <li> Caveat: Different skin, different results. This review is based on my experience. I have fair skin with some sensitivity issues. I was hoping this could help with my sun-induced hyperpigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied this treatment to the dark spots on my forehead, nose, and cheekbones on a regular basis (2x daily every day). I followed with a moisturizer (SPF 30 during the day). Occasionally, I felt a slight tingly sensation. A few times I noticed patches of what I hoped was peeling to reveal nice, new skin. Alas, it was just a dry patch. The dark spots remain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I will not purchase this product again. I used the entire tube without any visible results. On the plus side, it is cheap so it was no major loss!</li>
            <li> Great texture, and works well with my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using for sometime. Not a real noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> I used this Alpha Hydrox Spot Light for 3 weeks and got my desired result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am female and have had several children.  I believe the hormones from child birth made my skin between my upper lip and nose appear darker than my other skin so it looked like I had a mustache.  It definitely was my skin darker not hair growing there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Alpha Hydrox as instructed once in the morning then once at night.  I used sunscreen over the Alpha Hydrox.  After 2 weeks of use it started burning when I put it on so I would not put it on either AM or PM and use a good lotion instead.  Then the next AM or PM I would us the Alpha Hydrox again.  The skin dried out so it needed to be exfoliated which probably help get rid of the darker skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin normally has yellow under tones but where I used the Alpha Hydrox now the skin has pink under tones.  I will start only using the Alpha Hydrox once or twice per week to maintain the lighter skin.  I think if I continued using it daily the skin would become pinker and would not match the other skin on my face that is tan because its summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with the outcome and thankful I don&#x27;t have to have that masculine look.</li>
            <li> It has a slight chemical smell to it but the results far outweigh that one small drawback. I have been using this product mostly on my nose because it&#x27;s not shielded when I wear sunglasses.  The darkness was obvious compared to the rest of the skin on my face.  I had been using it a couple times a day.  Within a month I noticed my skin was peeling but there was no damage to the underlying skin.  I guess that&#x27;s what the product is suppose to do.  At any rate, I&#x27;m a happy camper.  It has lightened the deeply discoloration on my nose and I am now seeing results after using it on \\&quot;sun spots\\&quot; or \\&quot;age spots\\&quot; as well..  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have brown burn mark on my hand.... At first it started showing pink color and on 3rd day it turned into dark brown colour.... Stopped using after that but still day by day it is getting darker... Its been a week plus still no improvement....lNot for the sensitive skin...horrible product.....</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. It  took about 2 weeks to begin to notice the difference. Works well on sunspots.  Definitely buy it!</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping it would help lighten some brown spots i have from melasma.  It did nothing to help and I am disappointed.  Would not buy again.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> No difference in color noticed. I&#x27;ve been using this for awhile now on my face and doesn&#x27;t do anything besides moisturizer. Smells very strong</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for 2 weeks and already see a noticeable fading of the dark spots on my face.  So far, I have not experienced any irritation from the cream.  I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Great for dark SPOTS ♡♡♡</li>
            <li> I just started using this product this weekend and am following the directions -- twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is requiring me to give a rating so -- out of hopefulness -- I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the directions, you are supposed to see results within three months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That seems like a long time to wait but I am desperate to get rid of my brown patches and can&#x27;t afford to go to the dermatologist right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would love to see reviews from other people who have tried this product. What kind of results did you get? Thanks!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best I have found yet. It is cheap too. I have always love alpha hydroxy products.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions but the results were different then i had expected.Left my skin red, irritated, and dry. buyers be aware, and I m not the type of person with delicate skin. So think before you buy it . Yet again everyone has different types of skins and results are different for everyone.</li>
            <li> This did nothing for my spots and it started to smell after a while. I switched to prescription TriLuma and that worked almost right away. Of course TriLuma is significantly more expensive but then this didn&#x27;t do anything at all for me.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product.  I saw no results after having suffered through the terrible smell.  I broke out suddenly and 2 days after I stopped using this my acne mysteriously disappeared.</li>
            <li> It does not work as described. This is just a bleach. My wife used it and her dark spot became worse.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for only 4 days and today I woke up to find a dark hyper-pigmented patch on the side of my face where I have been using this lotion to get rid of two small spots. The patch is much worse than the two spots I have been trying to remove. I have been also using the lotion on other spots on my face, but the patch has appeared in only one spot. I just read up about hydroquinone and its effects and should have read this before applying the product. In my case the lotion has done a lot more harm than good; I&#x27;m surprised it&#x27;s sold over the counter.</li>
            <li> Hydrox was recommended by my skin doctor.  This product really does work to lighten dark skin spots.  However, it only worked so much.  I have dark patches on my fair skin, immediately under my ears.  This definitely worked to lighten the spots, but only to a certain extent.  It won&#x27;t lighten your dark spots to the same (or close) skin color as the rest of your skin. However, I would purchase this again because at least the dark patches are lighter.</li>
            <li> so i bought this product for all my brown spots caused by my acne. it has worked fine with me by lighting my dark spots slowly and has helped new ones from forming too dark. the really dark spots i think will not work- these spots I had all my life so cream will not work. I have combination skin- moderate acne, not so severe that it gets me depressed. It&#x27;s not a miracle cure for brown spots, but it will help brown be lighter, for me some brown spots have disappeared but not completely, so this is a long term skin treatment months-a year.</li>
            <li> I do not even use it as much as the box recommends and I already see a difference.  There has been a 3 prong dot on my forehead - right smack in the middle for a few years now.  It is a sun spot that will come back even if I have it lasered off by a dermatologist.  It has only been about 5 weeks - maybe 6 and it has cut the shade down by half and also shrunk some of it.  You will likely peel a bit - this is NORMAL for this kind of product.  Just follow the directions - and take it at your pace.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I developed dark pigmentation on my upper lip AFTER I gave birth to my son in July of 2011.  I thought it might help, and maybe it did fade it slightly (???) but the only thing that really helps is staying completely out of the sun/wearing sunscreen!!!!  So that is my advice...not buying this product...if you have that specific issue.</li>
            <li> Help to lighten a scar I had my leg.</li>
            <li> I am still using it; so far, i am yet to see results; however, i am willing to continue using it and see if it delivers what it promises</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used better products in the past.  Product is slow to work and little change in spots was noticed.  I will not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I used this product according to the instructions but did not see any visible changes, was kinda disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> This does take some time to work, so don&#x27;t expect overnight results. Also, if you put it on one area thickly, it will actually &#x27;burn&#x27; your skin and leave a nice red mark for a few days. And if you use this product, you MUST wear sunscreen or you will be doing more damage than good. Overall an economical product that works.</li>
            <li> I have used this product only three times so can&#x27;t give a proper review. It feels sticky on the skin. Hate the smell.</li>
            <li> I am a fair skinned african american female. Ive suffered with acne for a long time now. I now have mild acne and I developed hyperpigmentation from it. Ive tried many products to try and clear it but nothing would either work fast enough or AT ALL!!! Low and behold I came across this stuff while searching for something that WOULD work...and in just a few days of using it,I saw dramatic results. My brown spots are now a light brown and are continuing to fade. This stuff works! But you must be aggressive about using it Of course depending on the sensitivity of your skin. I DO RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I used the product for about three weeks, hoping it would lighten my dark spots - but it actually made them darker. So I wouldn&#x27;t buy this particular product again. Maybe it&#x27;s just my skin type??  Who knows.... I think I may need to try an entry-level TCA peel instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note:  Amazon was lightning fast on getting this out to me -- I received it a couple days after placing the order (I did \\&quot;free shipping\\&quot; on this so I wasn&#x27;t expecting to get it for a full week). A very nice surprise!  Plus, the box was appropriately packaged and in perfect condition - nice job!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the product long enough to know how effective it is at fading age spot and skin imperfections. However, the price is very good. Time will tell.</li>
            <li> WHEN I GOT THIS I FIGURED IT WOULD BE JUST ONE MORE TUBE I PURCHASED THAT DIDN&#x27;T WORK, BUT IN FACT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 7 YEARS, I CAN ACTUALLY SEE A DIFFERENCE IN MY DARK SPOTS FROM TANNING FOR YEARS.&lt;br /&gt;I AM 45 NOW, AND WAS A SUN GODDESS, BUT IT CAUGHT UP TO ME IN THE FORM OF SUN SPOTS ON MY CHEEKS, SO FOR ANYONE ON THE FENCE, I HAVE USED THIS FOR A MONTH AND A HALF AND THERE IS AN IMPROVEMENT...FOR REAL! THANKS FROM A REAL PERSON IN FLORIDA!!!!</li>
            <li> been using for 4 weeks 15 reduction ..will keep at it for the full 12 weeks</li>
            <li> This product seems to work. I think the prescription strengths would work better (obviously), but this one works alright. The smell is awesome too. It&#x27;s my best smelling product. Thanks! : )</li>
            <li> Didnt see any changes.</li>
            <li> I love this cream it is great on my dark spots that I got on my leg it works fast too</li>
            <li> Hmm it has a slightly funky smell, not bad just weird I guess more feminine. Haven&#x27;t had any success with using it almost daily  for a couple months wouldn&#x27;t buy it again for me</li>
            <li> I used this product for several weeks trying to remove age spots on my face. It made absolutely no difference. The age spots, large and small, were unchanged.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking that it would at least help...but it has \\&quot;really\\&quot; helped.  I have alot of skin damage from my younger years in the sun...this has worked great on my dark spots and really evened out my skin tone.  Yes the spots are still there but they are lighter..I expect as time goes on that they will fade even more.  A little goes a long way so this product will probably last around 3 - 6 months depending on how many places you use it.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product so I&#x27;m not quite sure if it works or not. But is is really smooth and makes my skin soft!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. I have been using this product for only 4 days and I am amazed at how fast and effective the results are on my dark skin. So glad I tried this before I bought a more expensive Product. I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Used up almost the whole thing, did not see any lightening. Even though I must say this line has got great products like their glycolic line, at great prices, this somehow just does not work for me.</li>
            <li> Dark spot on face is gone after consistent morning and night use for 5 weeks. I recommemd this. Cheap too!! Heck of a deal.</li>
            <li> I had a very dark and large spot from sun damage under one of my eyebrows and tried a LOT of different products, including some expensive ons, which did not seem to help at all.  I then tried this one and within a few days the spot began to fade!!!  It is MUCH less noticeable now and seems to be fading even further with daily use.  This is the first product that had results in a short time.  My only complaint is that it is taking a long time to fade more but as I have had that spot for at least ten years, I certainly can be patient.</li>
            <li> I used this along my collar bone to combat some sun damage.  Only used it for a week when my skin started to become bright red with irritation.  Discontinued use of course.  I&#x27;ve used this brand of foot cream with no ill effects.  I&#x27;d be careful about using this around the neck and face.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really tell if this product worked or if it was just a placebo effect. It seemed to work I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t make me break out or clog my pores (I have acne prone skin).&lt;br /&gt;It lasts incredibly long! (though the gel in mine turned brown now, which I think could be a reaction to light/oxygen interacting with it)&lt;br /&gt;It had an odd, plastic-like smell but nothing repulsive or overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I used this product to lighten my skin to normal after working in the sun for several months; I initially had a breakout of fine bumps but maybe I should have used it with a sunscreen.  So presently I am letting my skin get used to the sunscreen and then add this product.  My skin is darker than my makeup and hopefully this will help restore it to it&#x27;s normal shade and I won&#x27;t have to invest in new cosmetics.</li>
            <li> This had harmful hydroquinone.</li>
            <li> This stuff is very strong and will actually burn your skin if you overuse. Use it sparingly and carefully.</li>
            <li> great price for a great product, speedy delivery, no problems. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had some marks left from acne on my chest and they weren&#x27;t very attractive. The marks were already starting to fade after about a week. I kept using it of course. After a few weeks I stopped using it for reasons that had nothing to do with the product. Anyways, now, 2 months later, anytime I get really nervous, the very light dots on my chest turn really red  until I calm down. Other that that, you can hardly see the marks.</li>
            <li> I regret trying this product.....after a few days of use, my face was as red as a tomato from an allergic reaction....I didnt know it was this product until I saw my skin was peeling in the areas I applied this cream...Never again!</li>
            <li> Saw little or no results. Not worth it. Better products available that do work!  Don&#x27;t believe there is enough Alpha Hydroxy to do much, but I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I rarely ever post reviews, unless i am REALLY UNHAPPY with something.  I want to tell everyone how awesome this stuff is.  I had an accident where my tooth punctured my chin.  As a 25 year old woman, I was devastated at the thought of having a HUGE red scar.  Just as the injury was healing I began putting this on every morning.  My scar has faded so much, its nearly invisible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try to make this short...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT, I had horrible hormonal acne for years (still experience it sometimes) which many, very dark acne marks. This is by far the best product I have tried. My spots are basically gone and I spent less than $13. I don&#x27;t even need to buy a second tube.. still have more than half left and I&#x27;ve been using it for about two months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful in the sun, use it consistently and the results will come!</li>
            <li> This is a nice product at a great price, it does lighten spots, just do not expect that to happen overnight, give it a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> Just started using this 2 days ago and I already have great results!!! I had a hyper pigmented burn scar that was dark and I am Hispanic. I applied it 4 times on my hand and in 1 days it started to peel with bright clear new skin underneath! It turned red after a gentle exfoliation and I will update in a week. I will definitely recommend this product I have been using mederma on my hyper-pigmentation scar with very slow not very noticeable results and I&#x27;m so happy that this product works so good so fast!!!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have only used it two more times this week and after a few days it started to peel all on its own! My scar is now lighter than before and almost half way gone.  It is way less noticeable now since using the Spot light treatment.  I will continue to use it until the scar is completely gone.</li>
            <li> I love it, this is my 2nd or 3rd time ordering this product. It&#x27;s a little slow but works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week and I can already see some lightening of dark spots caused by sun damage and acne.  It does make my skin tingle and turn red when I apply it but that fades in 30 minutes so I wouldn&#x27;t advise using it right before you want to go out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month on a dime shaped liver spot and lightening has been negligible.  My update--began to lighten after a month&#x27;s use...definitely works, no problems.</li>
            <li> We have been using this product for a while with great results.  We initially used the identical product from Paula&#x27;s Choice but that product is never in stock so we switched to Alpha Hydrox.  My daughter has used it to help with acne scaring and hyperpigmentation caused from her cystic acne (she used accutane and is a year out from that treatment).  Our dermatologist recommended it once it was safe to use on my daughter&#x27;s skin.&lt;br /&gt;A note about hydroquinone....it is not an overnight fix.  It can actually take longer than a month to see results, it may also not work for everyone.  It took my daughter about 5 weeks to have some results, and for me personally about 7 weeks.  You also need to wear sunscreen or the process is nullified.&lt;br /&gt;Hydroquinone is actually the gold standard for treating any kind of age or sun spots.</li>
            <li> When i  started using this ..i noticed a change within 3 days , but i was doubtful because before i have had good results , then things changed ....my face is almost all clear from blemish spots ...but i have to state i use it with Alpha Hydrox AHA Enhanced Lotion( which i was using before, before adding this ) . after almost 3 years fighting stress related acne , i can walk around without make-up ...but i followed a reviewers advice less is more ..so i use very little of it ..And my face does not look bleached .</li>
            <li> Super age-spot lightener, very light and no signature hydroquinone odor.  Works well under sunscreen and night creams as well.  Also, does not cause breakouts, which has been a problem for me with other lightening products.</li>
            <li> Works on birthmarks. Takes time, don&#x27;t expect results before at least a month. And then great results at 2 months.</li>
            <li> after 2 days of using it, brown spot turned darker,,, it did not work so well. I won&#x27;t recommend people using it. Disappointed with product.</li>
            <li> I had a chemical peel at a spa.  It was a low grade peel, and my age spots did peel a little, but to keep this effect going, I got this product. I put a small dot on each cheek once in the AM and once in the PM - really massaging it into the age spot areas.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I had tried stuff from the dermatologist that DID NOT WORK...but I really think this works.  It did take 3 months to see my hormone induced facial age spots fade a bit...and they are not really GONE...but they are definately lighter.  I wish for a magic potion to remove them all together...one that does not rip the outer layers of skin off your face...like a major chemical peel does...but that is just a pipe dream, as there is nothing out there that is going to do that...your body chemistry and the product must work together. sometimes these things work .... sometimes not.  But this was not that expensive and it has been four months...and the tube is still more than half full...a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product it works very well with the other Alpha products.&lt;br /&gt;I will write back later with full results of skin discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;Quick fast shipment and great customer service.</li>
            <li> Been using it for 3 months.  Don&#x27;t see much difference besides burned marks when I put too much on.  Those burned marks eventually peel off and red pimple blemishes look lighter but still visible.  This is not a quick fix if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.  Expect to see results from the 3rd month.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing about this product is the smell, the price is great but it&#x27;s an add on item so I ended up spending way more but I have to say that it was so worth it! I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 days now and I already noticed a huge change, I originally got it for acne scars on 2 areas of my face but I also have freckles and its managed to fade both sooo much in such little time! I can&#x27;t wait to see my final results</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a while but have not used it, however I am a big fan of many other Alpha Hydrox products and use various ones on a daily basis. After having been diagnosed with Vitiligo a few years ago (I am, thankfully, Caucasion and thus the condition is not very noticeable), I&#x27;ve started to notice what appears to be permanent freckles or sun damage on my face, which has appeared primarily where I have depigmentation. Wherever the Vitiligo has spread, the brownish flecks, spots--whatever they are--have shown up. I have always had extremely clear, porcelain to peaches and cream skin, so these spots have bothered me a bit. I believe them to have shown up (and then stayed) after my summer vacation last year, when I went to the beach a few times--something I won&#x27;t be doing again without a lot of sun protection!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, after applying thin layers of this product to my face on the affected areas yesterday, I literally noticed that the spots and flecks, which are light tan or brown and have been on my face for months now, faded within a few HOURS. I applied it again later in the day, and have done so again today. I&#x27;m liking what I see so far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do notice a \\&quot;warm\\&quot; feeling in my face after applying the product, and possibly some very slight redness, but I&#x27;m used to using Alpha Hydrox products and it doesn&#x27;t bother me in the least. If you have tried other products by this excellent brand (such as the Soufflé cream), you will know what to expect. I don&#x27;t have especially sensitive facial skin, so if you do, any of these products might bother you and you should proceed with caution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will stop using this product once I (hopefully) reach a point where the spots and flecks have been sufficiently faded, as I am unsure what overdoing it with this type of product might result in. Since it seems to be effective and quite quick, I want to be careful not to bleach my skin. The Vitiligo has taken care of that enough already.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see that this is working.  I have used morning and night and there is barely any change to my freckles/age spots.</li>
            <li> I spent $60 on Clinique Even Better Dark Spot corrector and after two months I saw NO results. I had dark spots due to birth control that were horrible and embarrassing. I purchased the Clinique product because the lady at the Clinique counter promised it would work. It says use 2x per day. I became so desperate for it to do anything that I would apply it in the morning, followed by 50+ expensive sunblock, and 2-3x per night. It did nothing. I used it for two months. I actually think it made it worse. I started looking into laser therapy and was becoming hopeless. A friend recommended Alpha Hydrox Spot lightener. I thought it was never going to work because it only costed about $9.00. It worked OVERNIGHT!!!!! It will make your skin peel and be a little sensitive, so make sure to have a great moisturizer to use after, but the horrifying dark spot is gone OVERNIGHT, I did apply it twice in one night which is not recommended, but it worked Alpha Hydrox Spot Light Targeted Skin Lightener, 0.85 Ounce]]!!!!! Thank you Alpha Hydrox ! I would have paid triple for your product!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this skin lightener for a year now, and it does what it promises. I have a tan birthmark on one side of my face, and continually using this cream has reduced its appearance by 50%. Overall results showed up after 3 months use. If you want fast results, make sure to use it twice daily. Wonderful, inexpensive product that truly works. Btw, my skin did react the first couple of times that I used it, becoming pink for a few hours after application. After my skin became used to the product, I have never again experienced the redness.</li>
            <li> I am reluctant to admit that I am using this product and still frequenting the tanning bed. I know shame shame lol. However after 3 applications I noticed a huge improvement to my noticeably darkening freckles. After the third application I saw that my dark freckles were starting to lighten up and my face didn&#x27;t have so many dark *sun spots* WILL DEFIANTLY be purchasing this product again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks now and I have to say, I noticed the difference after one week.  I use it on my underarms and I&#x27;ve even been able to stop using my deordorant. Strange... anywho, fights odor and lightened my skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much change in the dark spots on my face, but I am still using this product.  The spots haven&#x27;t gotten any darker.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff without really believing it would work.  I used it regularly at night before bed for about a month.  To my surprise, it got rid of a dark liver spot on my cheek.  It works slowly, so you can&#x27;t really tell from one day to the next if its doing anything.  But after enough time passes, the difference is obvious.  So buy it.  Don&#x27;t worry.  It&#x27;s not snake oil.</li>
            <li> This is working great! I get minor skin irritation after application but it really works to lighten those pesky sunspots so it&#x27;s worth it for me. It&#x27;s only been a few weeks and the spots I&#x27;m treating are really responding, even the ones on my hands.</li>
            <li> This cream is highly dangerous if you don&#x27;t patch test! I bought mine on ulta. Was really looking forward to it. as greedy as i became on reading only the positive reviews, i decided to apply it on four different spots on my face! These spots to begin with were only 10% of what they look like after using this cream. It burnt my skin! literally. my skin became crusty and then peeled off and eventually left my bare flesh open on the surface. It was all red and couldn&#x27;t even be covered with makeup! it took almost a week to subside the redness on using neosporin. I immediately took the cream back to ulta and returned it for my money! I really wish I had done a patch test or only used it on one spot initially. now the spots are highly dark and I have very pigmented skin. ironically, this cream does the opposite of what it claims to do, at least for me!</li>
            <li> Active ingredient is Hydroquinone for skin bleaching is the main active ingredient....known to cause cancer. This fact is not mentioned in advertising</li>
            <li> This cream started showing improvement of my facial dark spots within the first 3 days. I was shocked and amazed at early results. I have endured terrible facial scarring due to illness. Such scarring left me embarrassed, insecure, and hiding behind make up. I started seeing an expensive dermatologist in 2012. She prescribed a very expensive tiny tube of spot lightner. Two years of treatment and my dark spots remained visible with no noticeable change. I had nothing to lose by trying this alpha hydrox cream. I was very skeptic based on past hype and experience with scar and blemish creams. Again, I am absolutely shocked and amazed. I stopped seeing that dermatologist, but recently started attending a medical spa center for different skin care. Today, I walked in and the tech asked immediately &amp;#34;What are you using on your face?...it looks great!&amp;#34; I told her I stopped using the pricey prescription skin lightner and bought alpha hydro lightner. She said &amp;#34;It is truly making a difference, keep using it.&amp;#34; This is from someone who works daily at a skin and beauty spa. I was pleased with her noticing the significant change from my last visit. I have very sensitive skin. Another plus about this cream is no irritation of any kind. A small amount with each use leaves no evidence  of it. A pleasing light scent. No overbearing medicine smell. No greasey/oily residue. I apply it in the early morning before applying make up. I apply it again at night after removing make up. I love this cream! I am gaining my confidence back. Mostly importantly, I am getting my natural glowing skin complexion back. Just because I have an illness does not mean I have to look bad. I am an upcoming business woman. A part of growing my business means meeting with potential customers and investors. I must be social and confident in my personal life and professional life. It is a blessing I came across this item. I will buy a second tube soon:)</li>
            <li> I would recommend this Product to anyone. A few months ago, I bumped my lower leg on my bed rail and it left a large black spot on it that just wouldn&#x27;t go away no matter what I tried. I did some research on amazon.com and found their Product, Spot Light. Started using it right away, within 2 weeks I could see a difference. and as of today, the color is fading into its natural color. I will be ordering more very soon !&lt;br /&gt;Thank you a million times&lt;br /&gt;L.Christian</li>
            <li> This seems to be lightening my dark spots on my cheek but it also burns my skin and causes red, sore spots with skin peeling. It may be my skin is too sensitive.</li>
            <li> Ok, first I stand by Alpha Hydrox products and I also stand by this one. I had a couple of dark spots on my legs, underarms and ankles from shaving (Which I know longer place a razer on my body)and this lightened up those spots.  It really works great, especially under my arms. But take note, this product does have 2% hydroquinone, which is known for lightening up dark spots quickly, but also is known for causing cancers, So make a wise decision on using this product. If you decide to use it don&#x27;t place in your regular regimen, use a glycolic instead.  But I used the entire small tube and it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Post Note: For products to really work it is wise to read the directions and use according to those instructions. With this product I used as suggested twice a day and I saw results quickly, I also exfoiliated the same areas before placing the product there, it will burn if you exfoilate first. So these two regimen helped my dark spots extreamly well...Good Luck!</li>
            <li> Worked and works great on my dark spots.  I applied during night times and use a 55 sunscreen protection during daylight while treatment.</li>
            <li> This product is watery and smells worse than any other product I have ever tried.  It was so gross  and watery that I only used it twice before looking for something else.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!! Yes, it takes a long time to work, but for the price, it is worth being patient! But it does work! I live in Florida and have spent more time in the sun than I should, and although I am young I have developed two small areas of hyper pigmentation (or sunspots) on my face that drive me nuts. This stuff DOES work. However, they will come back if re-exposed enough to the sun - but that is not a complaint of the product, that&#x27;s just how sunspots work! I&#x27;ve recommended this product to many people, it&#x27;s a steal!</li>
            <li> I have normal/oily skin and it gave me blackheads so I had to stop using it before any lightening happened. For me, it was not worth the money I spent on it. I have acne scars that I wanted to take care of and this was not the solution for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from on Amazon.com a few years ago and it didn&#x27;t work for me. I used it for a few weeks and never noticed any difference with my skin.</li>
            <li> After one month taking this product, I did not see any noticeable improvement in my skin tone. I did not continue to use the product long enough to tell if it is effective or not. I think it requires at least 2 months of use to see any noticeable results.</li>
            <li> Because I have not diligently applied twice a day as instructed, I cannot say if the product works when used as directed.  I apply nearly every day and usually twice but not always.  Thus far, the spots/scars are still there.  Could be my imagination, but I think they are lighter.  Still there, but possibly lighter.  The price was right so I tried it and I may or may not purchase again when my long lasting supply runs dry.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this brand, and I&#x27;m thrilled to have found it.  It doesn&#x27;t sting when applied as it has no alcohol.  Also great for applying locally, as the applicator is quite small.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t usually leave reviews unless the product AMAZES me and this one definitely has. I&#x27;ve had an issue with plucking chin hairs which has left me with HORRIBLE discoloration all over my chin, now I am african american (more of a caramel shade) so it is even more difficult for me to find a product that works. I have tried Garnier, Ambi, Murad and countless other products which haven&#x27;t done much of anything for me. I got this product last week and a week later the spots on my chin have significantly reduced! I apply it once in the morning and once at night, I&#x27;ve also been exfoliating and using sunscreen. Anyways, this product has worked WONDERS for me after just one week and I am so excited to see what it will do for me down the road. I will definitely be ordering again!</li>
            <li> still using and it is fading my skin spot</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t see much results from using this cream</li>
            <li> I have a few sun spots/dark spots on my face and have tried several products (including the expensive Shiseido dark spot remover--which didn&#x27;t work for me). After using this Alpha Hydrox Spot Lightener a few months now, one of my big dark spot on my face is almost gone! I use it almost every night, dab some of this white cream and apply it directly onto the spot and let it sit on my skin spot area--I don&#x27;t even rub it into my entire face as I don&#x27;t want my entire face to be white/pale--just a few spots.  I&#x27;ll continue to use it, especially on another spot that&#x27;s is still visible and taking longer to disappear. For this cheap price, it&#x27;s working for me slowly! Better than the $100+ bottle.  Don&#x27;t expect an overnight vanishing act, but give it time.</li>
            <li> Be very careful! I applied a very small amount one night before going to bed and the next morning I woke up with a severe red rash with bumps and shiny skin. It looks terrible!!! It was totally not worth it!!! I wish I could go back and not use it. I was using it to treat hyperpigmentation and now it&#x27;s much worse! Do not use!!!!</li>
            <li> Product is excellent. I started to use the proct as soon as I received it. It is working already for me. lov e it.</li>
            <li> It works, it just takes a really long time to fade out the spots.  I was hoping for something that took less time.</li>
            <li> I am an esthetician and just started getting some hyper-pigmentation in certain areas, I have never used hydro-quinine and was always a bit apprehensive. After doing some research and checking product ingredients, efficacy, pricing, and paula&#x27;s choice best reviews this was the best, most cost effective and high producing results product I found and am definitely thrilled I bought it. Just since purchasing a month ago, my age spots under my eyes are gone, I&#x27;m still working on the ones on my upper lip but they have been there longer and are more abundant and dominant, so make sure you catch those age spots early! Thanks so much definitely will be purchasing again in the future!</li>
            <li> Loved this product it works great</li>
            <li> Used this for 5 months now ans there has been no effect on my dark circles, despite using a sunscreen with 40 spf</li>
            <li> I feel like it was working the first two weeks and it has def helped with SOME darkspots. But the spots that are darker than others on my face havent really changed..unless it takes more time. Not terrible but i wont be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I got this product because I have some dark spots on my face.  Didn&#x27;t seem to do anything to lighten them.  I was recently at my Dr.&#x27;s and asked him for a prescription.  The prescription (from a Plastic Surgeon) only cost me $20 and after a few applications, it&#x27;s already working.  My advice - go to a Dr.</li>
            <li> Hi guys!&lt;br /&gt;I am retuning this product. I used it one time last night when I received the product. OMG! this morning, the area of my face where I apply the cream got really red and swollen. My skin was thick and swollen and irritated. I had to use Hydrocortisone.Plus with Aloe to clam the skin down. And my face is still red. Ice cube helps with the swollen.&lt;br /&gt;I think my skin just doesn&#x27;t like 2% Hydroquinone!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because I thought that Alpha Hydrox with have a different effect on the skin and will do good for dark spots treatment. BUT no !! it acts just the same as Hydronuinone!&lt;br /&gt;So just be careful .</li>
            <li> Hydroquinone seems to work for me, but I also bought one as a gift.  It appears that on asian skin, it doesn&#x27;t always work well, can make dark spots DARKER.  On her, it aggravated it and bumps appeared after using it, so she stopped immediately.</li>
            <li> Dark spot lightener.  I have used it for a couple of weeks.  Not seeing much progress.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product 6weeks and see a major improvement in my skin. i had some blemishes and some other dark spots which are now barely noticeable</li>
            <li> This really works. I noticed lighter age spots in just a few days. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Only gave this 3 stars at this point because I&#x27;m still early into the treatment.  I bought this because, like others, it was recommended by Dr. Oz.  So far I have some of the same issues that others have experienced, such as stinging, dry flaking skin on spots treated and some spots becoming darker.  I am not giving up at this point.  The stinging goes away after a few minutes and I now use a Qtip to apply the product just to the spots and avoid the surrounding skin.  A couple of spots are lighter, a couple darker and some have no change.  I don&#x27;t know yet if this will work miracles for me as I am 68, but I will keep trying.</li>
            <li> The strength of the Hydroquinone was not enough to remove my dark spots.  This maybe alright for some minor areas but didn&#x27;t do a thing for my spots.  I had to purchase a product wtih 3% Hydroquinone</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a month and have not seen any fading of the spots.  I would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> i love this product, i have used so many different products for my dark spots but nothing worked as good as this, especially since im in Afghanistan and the weather and water does not help. will recommend to a friend and buy another tube:)</li>
            <li> I finally decided to try and get rid of liver spots on the back of my hands which have become worse over time. My daughter mentioned it recently which prompted me to research which products had the most chance of working. Alpha Hydrox Spot Light Targeted Skin Lightener and Porcelana seemed to have good reviews so I bought both. It is now only day 4 and I&#x27;m suprised that I can see actual fading already. I have applied both twice daily which I read a doctor recommended for maximum results. The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me and I have only noticed a very slight tingle from the Alpha Hydrox Spot Light once or twice. I have also noticed a slight pinkish tint to the skin a couple times (which doesn&#x27;t last) but no irritation. I&#x27;m sure everyone reacts in their own unique way, but considering I expected little to begin with, I&#x27;m satisfied with these preliminary results. If I can sigificantly reduce the discoloration I will be happy. So far, I am pleased.</li>
            <li> I use this product to get rid of the brown spots on my jaw line.  It works! My skin looks more even toned.</li>
            <li> This cram really works, be careful it&#x27;s really strong and works very fast!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a week and can already see a huge improvement in my sun spots.  I am thrilled and can&#x27;t wait to see how it will look in a few more weeks!!</li>
            <li> I used this for the past 3 weeks now and I&#x27;ve not seen any changes. However I do see it slowly peel the skin on my scars, but no fading of the scars. Also makes my skin very dry and peels a lot.</li>
            <li> May work after using longer.  Used for 30 days.  No big difference noted.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed in this product. I have been using it faithfully AM and pm for several weeks and have seen little improvement. The dark spots I have are not that large. I feel like I have thrown away money on lighteners. I think I will have them layered off at the dermatologist&#x27;s office and cover them with make-up in the mean time. I truly wanted this product to work for me.</li>
            <li> I just ordered this product last night and was reading through the reviews. After reading through the negative reviews, it occurred to me there may not be adequate warnings on the label or box. Hydroquinone is, for the most part, a safe product. Some countries have banned its use, that&#x27;s true, but the products which led to the ban in those countries were contaminated with toxins such as mercury which were likely the source of the problems. A study where rats were injected with high levels of hydroquinone did produce cancer in those rats but there has never been any indication of a cancer risk with topical use. 2% is the strongest dose available without a prescription. No product containing hydroquinone should ever be used in combination with any form of peroxide including benzoyl peroxide meaning most acne medications should not be used along with it. Combining hydroquinone with any product containing a form of peroxide will result in a darkening of the skin-exactly the opposite of the desired effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The AHA 10% in this product is high for those who are not used to it and who may have sensitive or fair skin. It also has the potential to increase sensitivity to the sun. Although there are those who are sensitive or allergic to hydroquinone itself, I believe the AHA&#x27;s may be the culprit in a lot of the burning reported by some users. I&#x27;m fair skinned and freckled and plan to start very slowly to allow my skin to adjust to this product. Will probably start out using it every other night and cut back if irritation develops to every 3rd night until my skin gets accustomed to it. It will take a lot longer but this is the way to avoid serious irritation. I also plan to up my SPF protection when leaving the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing many may be unaware of is people who are allergic to sulfites may also react to hydroquinone. Sulfites are strictly limited in processed foods now to a level not likely to cause reactions but some medications, mostly injectables, do still contain a small amount as preservatives. Most people living now would not be aware if they have this allergy and might have a cross reaction to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be reviewing the product periodically once I start using it-I know the results will likely take a while to show up. I hope this helps clear up some confusion and leads to safer use of this product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money</li>
            <li> Alpha Hydrox Spot Light Targeted Skin Lightener is a cost-effective lightener. I purchased 2 tubes after reading the reviews. I purchased it to treat the age spots on the top of my hands. The product actually works. It took about 3 weeks to begin to see results. Took much longer for the darkest spots to be lightened. The acid in the cream did cause a light stinging, and it caused a few sores, probably from my scratching the skin, as it did cause my skin to itch considerably. Overall, I was pleased with the product and would recommend it. After finishing the treatment, the itching went away and the sores cleared up.</li>
            <li> I often get dark spots on my skin from exposure to the sun because I use Retin A.  However, this product really does lighten these spots after continuous usage of approx. 30 days or so.  Aside from that, the alpha hydroxy gradually removes the skin&#x27;s dead layers and leaves your face and neck with baby soft feel and look.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for about a week, and some of the dark spots have lightened a bit, but not as much as expected. I will give it the full trial and see what happens. It stings a bit at first, but did not break my face out.</li>
            <li> This stuff, as you&#x27;ve probably read, is amazing! I bought it just over 3 weeks ago and I can already tell a significant difference! I hate reviewing products but I want everyone to know how amazing this stuff is! I am a 18 year old female who suffers from mild acne on the lower sections of my cheeks and on my chin and it wouldn&#x27;t be that bad if it didn&#x27;t leave spots that last 20 times longer. This stuff worked within the first week of use, by week three, my darkest spots have lightened considerably, and my lighter ones have disappeared. Amazed by this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this skin lightener about a month ago and have used it faithfully as directed for nearly 4 weeks.  I was beginning to get discouraged last week, because I couldn&#x27;t see much, if any, improvement in the 3 dime-sized brown spots I&#x27;d developed over te summer.  But all of a sudden, beginning on Monday of  this week, I detected a marked improvement in those places.  Today, Friday, one spot is gone, one is nearly gone, and one is definitely lighter and probably on the way to disappearing.  I&#x27;m quite happy with the price and the results!</li>
            <li> Spot Light Skin Lightner Fade Cream :  This is a light weight lotion with 2% hydroquinone plus 10% Glycolic adic at a ph of 3.3 which makes the product effective.  Plus the correct type of packaging keeps the product stable..all in all I think this is a real beauty bargain.&lt;br /&gt;I  have been using this product on \\&quot;sun spots\\&quot; on my hands for 3 weeks now. I am delighted with the results as larger, darker spots are fading, and the smaller lighter ones have gone!!!&lt;br /&gt;As a bonus, the 10% Glycolic Acid has improved the general texture of the skin on my hands too.&lt;br /&gt;As directed, I use a hand cream with an spf (of 25) after applying this product.  If  you don&#x27;t use a sun screen, it wont work for you.  Wish I had found it years ago.!!!  Thanks Alpha Hydrox.</li>
            <li> Effect can also, is the smell is not so good</li>
            <li> This product scares me.. Not only does not work, it oozzess in your face once applied. It burn like fire. It feels like it eats your skin.even i only apply a tiny portion to small spot in my face. It sizzles.</li>
            <li> I only used this produce once.  Put a small amount on a few dark spots and it left those spots red and burned for nearly a week.  Maybe this is part of the process, but if so, i would have to plan on staying home for a few days to apply it as directed (twice a day).  I have heard that putting on a good moisturizer first would help.  I may try that, when I am going to be home for a few days.</li>
            <li> When i first got this product i put it on at night n when i woke up the next day in the morning my face was very red n was peeling i didnt no what to do so i just went to a doctor n threw this product out</li>
            <li> Recently started using and see a difference in a dark spot on my leg.  I was not going to wear shorts this summer because the spot, although not that large, was such and eyesore.  Made me feel like it would glare &amp;#34;look at me&amp;#34; but I feel hopeful with just a few days use.</li>
            <li> This skin lightening cream is terrific.  I will be sure to reorder this wonderful cream from Deparfumes web site.  The cream is gentle on the skin, but strong on lightening the dark spots.</li>
