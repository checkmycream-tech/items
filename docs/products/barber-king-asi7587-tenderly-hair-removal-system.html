            <li>PROBABLY GOOD FOR LIGHT, WHISPY HAIR.</li>
            <li>but I also ordered three more for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li>It works so much better then a razor.</li>
            <li>so had to order some more for myself.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find you on the internet and was able to order a new one.</li>
            <li>This is easy for her to manage.</li>
            <li>They are so easy on my face.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair but use it to keep the fine hair off</li>
            <li>I liked mine so much, I got one for my mother.</li>
            <li>Not as smooth on the skin and feels cheap.</li>
            <li>When this arrived, I was immediately  struck on how cheaply made it was...  </li>
            <li>It is very cheaply made and couldn&#x27;t \\&quot;cut butter with a hot knife.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Right out of the box this clipper sounds like it&#x27;s on</li>
            <li>Thank you for making a product that provides a safe and effective method for removing that pesky facial hair as well as hair in many other sensitive areas!  </li>

            <li>A quality product for such a small price - Great value.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so quick especially if you are in a rush.  </li>
            <li>I just buy a new one every 6 or 8 months.</li>
            <li>I like this better than the usual drugstore choices, the blade area is longer which i find easier to work with.</li>
            <li>The blades on the new one are too far apart to do their job.  </li>
            <li>This is the second of these little shavers I have purchased and my first one, which is several years old, is much better.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Tenderly Hair Removal System to anyone who has facial hair as this is the main use for me.   </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like this as well as my old one which was another brand.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, thorough and totally painless treating the problem, well, tenderly.</li>
            <li>Not only did I order a   new one for me</li>
            <li>I do use it on my eye lids but am very careful not pressing hard and let the barber king do the work you will love it.</li>
            <li>My sister gave me my first Barber King Tenderly several years ago because I had complained about the lack of success using other products.  </li>

            <li> I have been using the Barber King AS17587 for such a long time I can&#x27;t even remember where I purchased it--had to be in a store or catalog.  </li>
            <li> This remover leaves that tender skin smooth with no cuts or shaving, You can use it anywhere on sensitive skin with out worrying about cutting yourself.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the product, primarily because it was \\&quot;most ungentle\\&quot; when removing hair from the delicate bikini area.  </li>
            <li> I was really disappointed as I have depended on my old one for touching up hair cuts and getting rid of facial hair.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;blade\\&quot; barely moves compared to other similar products and it is very rough on my face.</li>
            <li> It is not poorly designed but poorly made.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple...</li>
            <li> &amp; I FOUND IT HARD TO REMOVE MY CHIN HAIR &amp; HAD TO GO OVER IT SEVERAL TIMES.  </li>
            <li> Not as well made as the previous one I purchased.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again; not worth the $$ or the trouble.</li>
            <li> I bought it to trim ear hair and when I tried it the cutter just stopped, so the product is a rip off don&#x27;t waste your money.    </li>
            <li> I have purchased at least 5 other brands of hair removal systems and none of them compare to the Barber King.  </li>
            <li> This is a poor product it did not work at all.  </li>
            <li> Its tender allright, but leaves lots of stubble behind.</li>
            <li> I am sorry I purchased this product.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, unwanted facial hair is one of those nasty crosses some of us have to bear in life.</li>
            <li> She is 96 and gets those annoying chin and lip hairs.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with the quality and effectiveness of this product.</li>

            <li> This is a poor product it did not work at all.  Don&#x27;t buy for any reason.  I bought it to trim ear hair and when I tried it the cutter just stopped, so the product is a rip off don&#x27;t waste your money.    Mike</li>
            <li> this product is the best for that unwanted hair that seems to grow on places u don&#x27;t want hair especially your face  it&#x27;s a best by</li>
            <li> Right out of the box this clipper sounds like it&#x27;s on it&#x27;s last leg.  The \\&quot;blade\\&quot; barely moves compared to other similar products and it is very rough on my face. I highly recommend you DO NOT BUY this hunk of junk!</li>
            <li> I liked mine so much, I got one for my mother. She is 96 and gets those annoying chin and lip hairs.  This is easy for her to manage.</li>

            <li> I was disappointed with the product, primarily because it was \\&quot;most ungentle\\&quot; when removing hair from the delicate bikini area.  I purchased this product because my electric shaver was \\&quot;prickly\\&quot; and left razor burn.  This was no better, though I did appreciate the size and shape; it was quite easy and comfortable to hold--just NOT to USE.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple... it didn&#x27;t remove any facial hair. I am very disappointed with the quality and effectiveness of this product.</li>
            <li> I am sorry I purchased this product.  It is very cheaply made and couldn&#x27;t \\&quot;cut butter with a hot knife.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like this as well as my old one which was another brand.  It doesn&#x27;t cut close enough.</li>
            <li> This is the second of these little shavers I have purchased and my first one, which is several years old, is much better.  The blades on the new one are too far apart to do their job.  I was really disappointed as I have depended on my old one for touching up hair cuts and getting rid of facial hair. It is not poorly designed but poorly made.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, unwanted facial hair is one of those nasty crosses some of us have to bear in life. In addition, we are told that shaving would increase the hair growth.  My sister gave me my first Barber King Tenderly several years ago because I had complained about the lack of success using other products.  Hesitantly I tried it and have been using nothing but the Tenderly ever since.  It&#x27;s gentle, thorough and totally painless treating the problem, well, tenderly.</li>
            <li> This is great for removing hair on your face. I bought this for my mom, so she could shave the hair above her lips. It works so much better then a razor. This remover leaves that tender skin smooth with no cuts or shaving, You can use it anywhere on sensitive skin with out worrying about cutting yourself.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for getting rid of unwanted hair but when you use it for awhile it does not work as well.  I just buy a new one every 6 or 8 months.</li>
            <li> Broke first time - don&#x27;t bother to purchase</li>
            <li> Barber King is everything advertised.  I have very dry/sensitive skin and this is the only hair removal system that works for me.  I have purchased at least 5 other brands of hair removal systems and none of them compare to the Barber King.  Thank you for making a product that provides a safe and effective method for removing that pesky facial hair as well as hair in many other sensitive areas!  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Not as well made as the previous one I purchased. Not as smooth on the skin and feels cheap.</li>
            <li> Its tender allright, but leaves lots of stubble behind. Not a close shave at all, &amp; on your face, the stubble is very obvious. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again; not worth the $$ or the trouble.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS NOT FOR ME.  I MISTAKENLY THOUGHT IT WAS AN EPILATOR.  THIS SHAVES OFF THE HAIR &amp; I FOUND IT HARD TO REMOVE MY CHIN HAIR &amp; HAD TO GO OVER IT SEVERAL TIMES.  HAIR IS BACK THE NEXT DAY.  PROBABLY GOOD FOR LIGHT, WHISPY HAIR.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with the Barber King.  When I bought them I ordered 3 of them and gave them as gifts so had to order some more for myself. They are so easy on my face.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair but use it to keep the fine hair off and it&#x27;s so quick especially if you are in a rush.  Going either direction on your face also under your nose and on your chin. I do use it on my eye lids but am very careful not pressing hard and let the barber king do the work you will love it. I am very impressed.  You gotta try it if you have facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;L Reasy&lt;br /&gt;Seattle WA.</li>
            <li> I bought this item to trim my facial hairs...it works wonderfully for me and I am very happy with it!!</li>
            <li> Purchased this product as replacement for another purchased about 5 years ago.  I use it to trim the hairline along the back of my neck.  It does a beautiful job without pinching or scratching.  It is easy to use, clean and requires no maintainenance and lasts a very long time.  A quality product for such a small price - Great value.</li>
            <li> When this arrived, I was immediately  struck on how cheaply made it was...  I tried it out, and it didn&#x27;t even cut the hair all that well.  Back to the drawing board.  I find better quality @ local stores.</li>
