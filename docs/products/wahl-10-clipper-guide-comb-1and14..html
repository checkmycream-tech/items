            <li>It was a good buy for me</li>
            <li>It is good that the 1.25 and 1.5 inch sizes are sold.</li>

            <li>Good addition to the kit pieces.</li>
            <li>Good idea,</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll try the 12, but the #10&#x27;s 1 &amp;1/2&amp;#34; seems to be a good length.</li>
            <li>It is a good length.</li>
            <li>Oh and the item arrived in good time too.</li>
            <li>good stability compared to the 1.5 inch attachment that bends.</li>

            <li>I need this item quick and the shipment went perfect</li>

            <li>My husband is able to cut his own hair now at a length that looks best on him and it was worth the money!</li>
            <li>This product seems to be made strong and works great.</li>
            <li>Great product, really quick shipping too!</li>
            <li>Perfect thanks love it!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li>and if you&#x27;re doing your own hair you should have another person help out</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair which saves me a lot of money each year.</li>
            <li>This was delivered as just a clipper blade, no packaging of any kind except for the envelope it was mailed it.  </li>
            <li>I own, there is some flexibility.  </li>
            <li>shipped is a nice box.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;cutting my own hair for 10 years, and</li>
            <li>Fits my Wahl clippers nice and snug.  </li>
            <li>This fits my wall clippers perfectly and works very well.</li>
            <li>It works nicely -</li>
            <li>Heavy duty, fits perfect, works great!</li>
            <li>This clip attachment is a must if you have a compatible clipper &amp; like to cut your own hair or the hair of others/ friends or family.</li>
            <li>for any of my friends or family members that own &amp; clipper that these work with.</li>
            <li>cuz i cut my own hair</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair.</li>
            <li>use this in combination with a #12 to get a nice fade.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re looking to cut your own hair</li>
            <li>This is the perfect size for me and works very well.</li>
            <li>The blades are much longer than the 1&amp;#34; guide that came with my Wahl clipper and therefore they are not as &amp;#34;sturdy&amp;#34; but this work wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I just bought these and the #12 along with the Wahl cordless designer clippers to cut my own hair on the top so far they are awesome</li>
            <li>Thanks for a good product!</li>
            <li>Works just fine!</li>
            <li>Everything arrived quickly and in good condition.</li>
            <li>/&gt;And if I can cut my OWN hair, it would be completely EASY to cut someone else...</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this.</li>
            <li>Good length but cheaply made and doesn&#x27;t securely latch onto the clippers</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clipper guide, it does its job and nothing more.</li>
            <li>my hair will always be perfect and my life will never be the same!</li>
            <li>Much better than the Conair set</li>
            <li>Great price, fast shipping, and cuts my hair to the length I want without needing scissors.</li>
            <li>This is my guard I use to trim the top of my head.</li>
            <li>These do the job ok, but they make me nervous.</li>
            <li>Love the length of this one.</li>
            <li>(used # 10 on top and #6 on side and #7 and #8 to blend.</li>
            <li>1/4\\&quot; and the 1\\&quot; (#8), which is the largest comb sold in kits.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The top a 10.</li>
            <li>So I opted for the #10 clip hoping better results.</li>
            <li>It would be nicer if it&#x27;s more sturdy</li>
            <li>reference, this is the Wahl set we have now and love: http://www.amazon.com/Wahl-79524-2501-Chrome-24-Piece-Haircut/dp/B0026IBSVE/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_hg_5?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;0D3HQ2AFRCMQV3ZTAS2R</li>
            <li>Wish I had more of these at longer lengths.</li>
            <li>With a sturdy guide like this, even those who have never cut hair can feel confident to get the job done.</li>
            <li>Would be better with more tines or teeth to make it stronger and comb hair better.</li>
            <li>Definitely satisfied</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li>What more can you say.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s job, it helps make trimming my family&#x27;s hair a lot more easier.</li>
            <li>For my hair, I use a 10 up on top, and a 5 on the sides.</li>
            <li>I still love her though.</li>
            <li>and I can tell you that this attachment is a worthwhile purchase.  </li>
            <li>is built better then my #12 and is not too flimsy considering the size of it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this too many times to count, I like my hair longer then a size #8</li>
            <li>I clip my top with this</li>
            <li>I got this one and the 1.5&amp;#34; guide to trim hair on the top of my head.  </li>
            <li>I love my Wahl clippers</li>
            <li>Works okay for in between hair cuts.</li>
            <li>Very excited.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very glad I got brave enough to try home haircuts.  </li>
            <li>The guard fits on the clippers perfectly and it works just as expected.</li>
            <li>This comb is ideal for a short, but not buzzed trim.</li>
            <li>Great, blades are not too soft.  </li>
            <li>Tines bend easily.  </li>
            <li>So easy just take your time and learn.</li>
            <li>The number 12 is too floppy to easily use.</li>
            <li>This shipped very quick and fits my trimmer well.</li>
            <li>made of good plastic and is a nice UNIVERSAL attachment.</li>
            <li>The guide is strong.</li>
            <li>they work just fine and make it easy for keeping the hair a bit longer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect length if you are wanting a clean cut without looking like you are in the military.</li>
            <li>Still works fine and snaps into place.  </li>
            <li>It fits and works fine.</li>
            <li>It works fine.</li>
            <li>Fits Great onto my Wahl Clippers made sturdy and properly labeled to easily know what guide it is.</li>
            <li>Overall very satisfied!</li>
            <li>Huge difference from this&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>fit my wahl clippers and it cut my hair just the way I wanted it.</li>
            <li>The guards do necessarily fit snuggly</li>
            <li>This is great for people don&#x27;t know how short they want their hair to be cut.</li>
            <li>The fact that Wahl provides these guards longer than 1 inch is great, but you can&#x27;t expect them to be built as well as the standard 1/8-1 inch guards.</li>
            <li>I fit my clippers and worked as advertised.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable when rolling of the head when using.</li>
            <li>clips on my cheap Wahl clipper.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve cut my own hair for years now and this made it that much easier.</li>
            <li>Fit my conair clippers well.</li>
            <li>Fits on a cheap Conair clipper that I have.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this twice now and so far, I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>Should&#x27;ve known better than to look elsewhere, first.</li>
            <li>Because it wasnt included in the original Wahl pack.</li>
            <li>but is not like the original combs from wahl.</li>
            <li>(Remember when things--even cars--were made of metal and worked perfectly for many years, and didn&#x27;t pollute the oceans, and could be melted down and recycled into new products?)</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s little, and no one cares right now if his hair is perfect.  </li>
            <li>Snaps right onto our Wahl trimmer and my sons are quite happy to have that extra 1/4 inch!</li>
            <li>It does the job but nothing really special.</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair and so far I haven&#x27;t had any issues with clip...</li>
            <li>Good item if you are looking for a short hair cut.</li>
            <li>It is easy to put on clippers and it gives consistent results.</li>
            <li>this is good even though it vibrate little bit more than the #8</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, too.</li>
            <li>He can use this blade to cut his own hair, precise and not too short.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping too</li>
            <li>The combo pack was priced alright &amp; it did ship &amp; arrive fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>It works OK for a cheap haircut without the look of an actual shaved head which is exactly what I wanted, it&#x27;s just that the #12 is better at it.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the #10 here instead, but that&#x27;s a personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very glad to have this extension in my set.</li>
            <li>It is a great add on to the standard combs that comes with the normal package.</li>
            <li>Great product and is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s been HOT!</li>
            <li>Yes it doesn&#x27;t feel very sturdy, but it works just fine for me.  </li>
            <li>Feels a little flimsy, but works great</li>
            <li>This is a must have for men that want to buzz their own head but want a little longer of a top length.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s longer than it&#x27;s worth the effort.</li>
            <li>my husband gives my 3 years old hair cuts and I like when he leaves the top longer.  </li>
            <li>I received the guide promptly, and it is a perfect replacement for our broken</li>
            <li>worth a buy.</li>
            <li>The #10, at least with me, left me with a excellent amount of hair up top.</li>
            <li>This clipper attachment was worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Nice quality, feels sturdy enough.</li>
            <li>well worth it, would buy again.</li>
            <li>people aware that it really is that easy with these guides</li>
            <li>It works good just like other combs in the wahl clipper set.</li>
            <li>Just the right spacer for my hair.</li>
            <li>It gave me just the right length.</li>
            <li>Right length</li>
            <li>The 1 1/4&amp;#34; guide is just the right length for me.</li>
            <li>I tried it out, and it snaps right in place on my Conair clippers and fits well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This guard is just the right length and feels well-made.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right.</li>
            <li>Now I can get right hair cut.</li>
            <li>#8 and down because they&#x27;re just made with more comb guides and shorter, so more stout by nature,</li>
            <li>To get a nice finish clean the edges around the head with scissors and around the neck at the back use a new razor you shave with to get  straight clean lines.</li>
            <li>This one is a little bit longer and gives me a bit more length on the top.</li>
            <li>One inch was a little short so this was perfect!</li>
            <li>have a conair clipper and had just ordered a new Wahl clipper set thinking this guide wouldn&#x27;t fit the conair I have, since that&#x27;s what my research showed</li>
            <li>Of course, it is not as firm and strong as the original one, but it is acceptable, I used it, and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>so just be aware of those.</li>
            <li>It took a bit more of an effort than the standard length combs but if you&#x27;re looking for an at home hairdo</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>The #8 clipper guide that comes with most sets was just a bit too short to cut my hair to a manageable length (it made it spikey).  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re debating buying this or the #12, buy this one first and wait - it might be all you</li>
            <li>I received exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Works great on thick hair.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>All Wahl clipper guide combs are interchangeable with ANY Wahl product as far as I know, so you KNOW it will fit, first of all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described...</li>
            <li>To make these work they&#x27;d need to made from better material, such as metal.</li>
            <li>Paid for itself the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what you would expect.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t trust my wife to get the length the same on the top</li>
            <li>It was the exact length I needed and is the official Wahl brand.</li>
            <li>Just exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>Previously thought an Oster comb would fit OK on our Wahl unit.  </li>
            <li>In spite of this it still does a pretty reasonable job trimming up the pups for the warmer months.</li>
            <li>my wahl clipper is pretty much done</li>
            <li>This is high quality, and a good way to get a longer cut than you usually can from the standard 1-8 guides that come with most clipper kits.</li>
            <li>This is my second time purchasing it, my first one was dropped while connected to the clippers, but this is great for a college student like me who is tight with money and loves to avoid spending $20 every time I get a hair cut.</li>
            <li>with enough hair to style, but easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>Plastic just can&#x27;t take the stress at this length and the tines bend back and forth too easily.</li>
            <li>With the longer combs you have to go over your hair many more times to get all the long hairs, but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li>I like how it is able to trim it it down to length, I still use scissors to get the right look and cut evenly but def.</li>
            <li>Very convenient.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sturdy and works very well.</li>
            <li>Just what I had ordered and received it fast.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise you won&#x27;t get much of a trim.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what else to say, really.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t cost to much either.</li>
            <li>The #10 worked better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really write reviews that often, but I just wanted to</li>
            <li>The guide combs that came with our set have one more prong and are made of harder plastic.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Would rate one star, but two because they were cheap and the only ones available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t get it to grip the hair very well, perhaps the hair has to be much longer in order for it to work.</li>
            <li>All of Wahl&#x27;s clips are made well (with the exception of one that doesn&#x27;t fit snug against the actual clipper unit, but, what are your gonna do)and have saved me thousands of dollars in haircuts over the years.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I ordered this #10 and also a #12 (separate order) and they both arrived very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but, I don&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li>This is a very reliable product.</li>
            <li>cuz it take to much time</li>
            <li>Really helps make longer haircuts a breeze.</li>
            <li>His hair isn&#x27;t sticking straight out at all.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely not as firm as the #8, but it is more solid than the #12.  </li>
            <li>They should use better quality plastic or some other material for this large size of comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair after getting tired of others not cutting it right.  </li>
            <li>Like other reviews say it is leaves a lot more hair than an 8 guard</li>
            <li>I pretty much just bought it to complete my set.</li>
            <li>This could be the cause of the bent/warped teeth, but trying to bend it back straight isn&#x27;t very easy, so I assume that they must have been in that bent state for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Next level an 8 a full circle around my head.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read that this is more of a problem with the #12 guard which is even longer (larger) and therefore more delicate.</li>
            <li>The problem that most people are not understanding is that initially Wahl and most other brands alike provide their longest guards being the #8 or 1 inch only.</li>
            <li>I was ok with that, as the nature of a bigger limbs would mean more leverage to bend them.</li>
            <li>The less hair, the better.</li>
            <li>Much better quality than the 1.5 inch blade I bought on Amazon (that one is black in color).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I finally found this larger clipper guide!  </li>
            <li>a decent set of clippers.</li>
            <li>Because the attachment is larger than your standard 1 through 8 size attachments, it does bend slightly more.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>Too many use little or no combs these days.</li>
            <li>It is a little more flimsy than the stock combs but its not a problem at all.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to go go just a little bit more.</li>
            <li>A little flimsy but worked ok.</li>
            <li>This particular size is missing from most Clipper Kits.</li>
            <li>The plastic is not as strong as the other Wahl guide combs</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the size that was missing in my Wahl hair trimming kit, so I&#x27;m quite pleased with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>It gives a better haircut that what I was getting from the barber because it is never too short or too long.  </li>
            <li>: Spent a bunch of money buying a brand new clipper set because I didn&#x27;t think this Wahl Guide Comb would fit my Conair clippers..</li>
            <li>Built sturdy, clips on easy, simple to use, built to last.</li>
            <li>Right length for a mid level cut.</li>
            <li>I think it is too flexible for fine hair, it didn&#x27;t seem to do much and the parts it did do looked too choppy.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I just bought the new assembly for my clippers as well.</li>
            <li>Is very soft.</li>
            <li>but this one is pretty solid.</li>
            <li>one thing is that it makes noise but its nothing to big if your going to make your money back and its only to cut top at times.</li>
            <li>Pretty much what we expected.</li>
            <li>Teeth are a little wobbly, which is why I gave four stars but still seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair for the last 3 year and it makes it easy for a quick trim every month or any special events.</li>
            <li>cutting my own hair now... it took courage to do that for the first time!  </li>
            <li>This thing makes quick work of my hair and keeps me looking sharp every day.</li>
            <li>Hard to say I love it, it&#x27;s just a guard.</li>
            <li>doesnt leave the hair even at all, but that is to be expected with such huge combs.</li>
            <li>Just the length I wanted for my 9 year old.  </li>
            <li>Daughter is busy student:  </li>
            <li>Also, in most cases you can go to a beauty school/salon for trims as barber do fades for commonly.</li>
            <li>I have been using it to cut my hair for months so far, no issues.</li>
            <li>I ordered this cut my son&#x27;s (14 months old) hair without going to the barber shop.  </li>
            <li>The attachment locks firmly in place and remains secure while in use.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommended it to anyone who wants a longer buzz.</li>
            <li>so this is much appreciated, Will definitely be putting this to use.</li>
            <li>I realized my hair was shorter than when I used my old guide.</li>
            <li>The comb portion is very flimsy and seems like it will bend when in use and possibly will screw up trimming my hair.</li>
            <li>So to end my review i do not think it&#x27;s the manufactures fault as far as sturdiness of the guards are or are not, as for the fact that the guards shouldn&#x27;t be that long in the first place.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s pretty solid overall.</li>
            <li>have an older model and it secures solidly and does not snag hair.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li>This guard is quite long, and thus the prongs do shift around a bit while using it, but not so much as to affect its utility.</li>
            <li>I used it once or twice then got a little bold &amp; went with the #10.</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s the only one like this out there, especially since it&#x27;s Wahl, but the \\&quot;fingers\\&quot; or blades are much more flexible than the attachments that usually come.  </li>
            <li>I wish if it was a little stronger (it feels softer than original smaller parts).</li>
            <li>it was loud and it took several runs over my hair to cut it</li>
            <li>No regrets.</li>
            <li>This attachment performs exactly as expected and delivery was fast.  </li>
            <li>However, it is barely noticeable and it will not cause you any problems.  </li>
            <li>Was well made.&lt;br /&gt;Did a good job of cutting my hair at the #10 length.&lt;br /&gt;Stayed attached to clipper head.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived as promised.</li>
            <li>the other one vibrate too much.</li>
            <li>Like others say, yes, it&#x27;s true, the #8 standard clip bundled with all those sets is sometimes just plain too short of a cut.</li>
            <li>Wahl guide combs make it possible to do a good job cutting your hair yourself and avoid having to go to the barber.</li>
            <li>thinner than the ones that come with the clippers, but sturdy enough to do a good job of cutting hair.</li>
            <li>is a #8 which is just a little too small for the top / longest layer of a man&#x27;s haircut, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I was aware of the reviews stating that it is very flimsy and thin plastic.</li>
            <li>The blades are very flimsy which causes it to not hug tightly to my son&#x27;s head.  </li>
            <li>I cut my son&#x27;s thin, fine hair with a #8, and I felt that it was too short.  </li>

            <li> Perfect thanks love it!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li> and if you&#x27;re doing your own hair you should have another person help out</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair which saves me a lot of money each year.</li>
            <li> This was delivered as just a clipper blade, no packaging of any kind except for the envelope it was mailed it.  </li>
            <li> I own, there is some flexibility.  </li>
            <li> shipped is a nice box.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;cutting my own hair for 10 years, and</li>
            <li> Fits my Wahl clippers nice and snug.  </li>
            <li> This fits my wall clippers perfectly and works very well.</li>
            <li> It works nicely -</li>
            <li> Heavy duty, fits perfect, works great!</li>
            <li> This clip attachment is a must if you have a compatible clipper &amp; like to cut your own hair or the hair of others/ friends or family.</li>
            <li> for any of my friends or family members that own &amp; clipper that these work with.</li>
            <li> cuz i cut my own hair</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair.</li>
            <li> use this in combination with a #12 to get a nice fade.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re looking to cut your own hair</li>
            <li> This is the perfect size for me and works very well.</li>
            <li> The blades are much longer than the 1&amp;#34; guide that came with my Wahl clipper and therefore they are not as &amp;#34;sturdy&amp;#34; but this work wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I just bought these and the #12 along with the Wahl cordless designer clippers to cut my own hair on the top so far they are awesome</li>
            <li> Thanks for a good product!</li>
            <li> Works just fine!</li>
            <li> Everything arrived quickly and in good condition.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And if I can cut my OWN hair, it would be completely EASY to cut someone else...</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this.</li>
            <li> Good length but cheaply made and doesn&#x27;t securely latch onto the clippers</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clipper guide, it does its job and nothing more.</li>
            <li> my hair will always be perfect and my life will never be the same!</li>
            <li> Much better than the Conair set</li>
            <li> Great price, fast shipping, and cuts my hair to the length I want without needing scissors.</li>
            <li> This is my guard I use to trim the top of my head.</li>
            <li> These do the job ok, but they make me nervous.</li>
            <li> Love the length of this one.</li>
            <li> (used # 10 on top and #6 on side and #7 and #8 to blend.</li>
            <li> 1/4\\&quot; and the 1\\&quot; (#8), which is the largest comb sold in kits.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The top a 10.</li>
            <li> So I opted for the #10 clip hoping better results.</li>
            <li> It would be nicer if it&#x27;s more sturdy</li>
            <li> reference, this is the Wahl set we have now and love: http://www.amazon.com/Wahl-79524-2501-Chrome-24-Piece-Haircut/dp/B0026IBSVE/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_hg_5?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;0D3HQ2AFRCMQV3ZTAS2R</li>
            <li> Wish I had more of these at longer lengths.</li>
            <li> With a sturdy guide like this, even those who have never cut hair can feel confident to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Would be better with more tines or teeth to make it stronger and comb hair better.</li>
            <li> Definitely satisfied</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li> What more can you say.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s job, it helps make trimming my family&#x27;s hair a lot more easier.</li>
            <li> For my hair, I use a 10 up on top, and a 5 on the sides.</li>
            <li> I still love her though.</li>
            <li> and I can tell you that this attachment is a worthwhile purchase.  </li>
            <li> is built better then my #12 and is not too flimsy considering the size of it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this too many times to count, I like my hair longer then a size #8</li>
            <li> I clip my top with this</li>
            <li> I got this one and the 1.5&amp;#34; guide to trim hair on the top of my head.  </li>
            <li> I love my Wahl clippers</li>
            <li> Works okay for in between hair cuts.</li>
            <li> Very excited.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very glad I got brave enough to try home haircuts.  </li>
            <li> The guard fits on the clippers perfectly and it works just as expected.</li>
            <li> This comb is ideal for a short, but not buzzed trim.</li>
            <li> Great, blades are not too soft.  </li>
            <li> Tines bend easily.  </li>
            <li> So easy just take your time and learn.</li>
            <li> The number 12 is too floppy to easily use.</li>
            <li> This shipped very quick and fits my trimmer well.</li>
            <li> made of good plastic and is a nice UNIVERSAL attachment.</li>
            <li> The guide is strong.</li>
            <li> they work just fine and make it easy for keeping the hair a bit longer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect length if you are wanting a clean cut without looking like you are in the military.</li>
            <li> Still works fine and snaps into place.  </li>
            <li> It fits and works fine.</li>
            <li> It works fine.</li>
            <li> Fits Great onto my Wahl Clippers made sturdy and properly labeled to easily know what guide it is.</li>
            <li> Overall very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Huge difference from this&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> fit my wahl clippers and it cut my hair just the way I wanted it.</li>
            <li> The guards do necessarily fit snuggly</li>
            <li> This is great for people don&#x27;t know how short they want their hair to be cut.</li>
            <li> The fact that Wahl provides these guards longer than 1 inch is great, but you can&#x27;t expect them to be built as well as the standard 1/8-1 inch guards.</li>
            <li> I fit my clippers and worked as advertised.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable when rolling of the head when using.</li>
            <li> clips on my cheap Wahl clipper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut my own hair for years now and this made it that much easier.</li>
            <li> Fit my conair clippers well.</li>
            <li> Fits on a cheap Conair clipper that I have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice now and so far, I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> Should&#x27;ve known better than to look elsewhere, first.</li>
            <li> Because it wasnt included in the original Wahl pack.</li>
            <li> but is not like the original combs from wahl.</li>
            <li> (Remember when things--even cars--were made of metal and worked perfectly for many years, and didn&#x27;t pollute the oceans, and could be melted down and recycled into new products?)</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s little, and no one cares right now if his hair is perfect.  </li>
            <li> Snaps right onto our Wahl trimmer and my sons are quite happy to have that extra 1/4 inch!</li>
            <li> It does the job but nothing really special.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair and so far I haven&#x27;t had any issues with clip...</li>
            <li> Good item if you are looking for a short hair cut.</li>
            <li> It is easy to put on clippers and it gives consistent results.</li>
            <li> this is good even though it vibrate little bit more than the #8</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, too.</li>
            <li> He can use this blade to cut his own hair, precise and not too short.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping too</li>
            <li> The combo pack was priced alright &amp; it did ship &amp; arrive fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> It works OK for a cheap haircut without the look of an actual shaved head which is exactly what I wanted, it&#x27;s just that the #12 is better at it.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the #10 here instead, but that&#x27;s a personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very glad to have this extension in my set.</li>
            <li> It is a great add on to the standard combs that comes with the normal package.</li>
            <li> Great product and is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> &amp; it&#x27;s been HOT!</li>
            <li> Yes it doesn&#x27;t feel very sturdy, but it works just fine for me.  </li>
            <li> Feels a little flimsy, but works great</li>
            <li> This is a must have for men that want to buzz their own head but want a little longer of a top length.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s longer than it&#x27;s worth the effort.</li>
            <li> my husband gives my 3 years old hair cuts and I like when he leaves the top longer.  </li>
            <li> I received the guide promptly, and it is a perfect replacement for our broken</li>
            <li> worth a buy.</li>
            <li> The #10, at least with me, left me with a excellent amount of hair up top.</li>
            <li> This clipper attachment was worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> Nice quality, feels sturdy enough.</li>
            <li> well worth it, would buy again.</li>
            <li> people aware that it really is that easy with these guides</li>
            <li> It works good just like other combs in the wahl clipper set.</li>
            <li> Just the right spacer for my hair.</li>
            <li> It gave me just the right length.</li>
            <li> Right length</li>
            <li> The 1 1/4&amp;#34; guide is just the right length for me.</li>
            <li> I tried it out, and it snaps right in place on my Conair clippers and fits well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This guard is just the right length and feels well-made.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right.</li>
            <li> Now I can get right hair cut.</li>
            <li> #8 and down because they&#x27;re just made with more comb guides and shorter, so more stout by nature,</li>
            <li> To get a nice finish clean the edges around the head with scissors and around the neck at the back use a new razor you shave with to get  straight clean lines.</li>
            <li> This one is a little bit longer and gives me a bit more length on the top.</li>
            <li> One inch was a little short so this was perfect!</li>
            <li> have a conair clipper and had just ordered a new Wahl clipper set thinking this guide wouldn&#x27;t fit the conair I have, since that&#x27;s what my research showed</li>
            <li> Of course, it is not as firm and strong as the original one, but it is acceptable, I used it, and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> so just be aware of those.</li>
            <li> It took a bit more of an effort than the standard length combs but if you&#x27;re looking for an at home hairdo</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> The #8 clipper guide that comes with most sets was just a bit too short to cut my hair to a manageable length (it made it spikey).  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re debating buying this or the #12, buy this one first and wait - it might be all you</li>
            <li> I received exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Works great on thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> All Wahl clipper guide combs are interchangeable with ANY Wahl product as far as I know, so you KNOW it will fit, first of all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described...</li>
            <li> To make these work they&#x27;d need to made from better material, such as metal.</li>
            <li> Paid for itself the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what you would expect.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t trust my wife to get the length the same on the top</li>
            <li> It was the exact length I needed and is the official Wahl brand.</li>
            <li> Just exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Previously thought an Oster comb would fit OK on our Wahl unit.  </li>
            <li> In spite of this it still does a pretty reasonable job trimming up the pups for the warmer months.</li>
            <li> my wahl clipper is pretty much done</li>
            <li> This is high quality, and a good way to get a longer cut than you usually can from the standard 1-8 guides that come with most clipper kits.</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing it, my first one was dropped while connected to the clippers, but this is great for a college student like me who is tight with money and loves to avoid spending $20 every time I get a hair cut.</li>
            <li> with enough hair to style, but easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> Plastic just can&#x27;t take the stress at this length and the tines bend back and forth too easily.</li>
            <li> With the longer combs you have to go over your hair many more times to get all the long hairs, but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> I like how it is able to trim it it down to length, I still use scissors to get the right look and cut evenly but def.</li>
            <li> Very convenient.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy and works very well.</li>
            <li> Just what I had ordered and received it fast.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise you won&#x27;t get much of a trim.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what else to say, really.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t cost to much either.</li>
            <li> The #10 worked better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really write reviews that often, but I just wanted to</li>
            <li> The guide combs that came with our set have one more prong and are made of harder plastic.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Would rate one star, but two because they were cheap and the only ones available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t get it to grip the hair very well, perhaps the hair has to be much longer in order for it to work.</li>
            <li> All of Wahl&#x27;s clips are made well (with the exception of one that doesn&#x27;t fit snug against the actual clipper unit, but, what are your gonna do)and have saved me thousands of dollars in haircuts over the years.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I ordered this #10 and also a #12 (separate order) and they both arrived very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but, I don&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li> This is a very reliable product.</li>
            <li> cuz it take to much time</li>
            <li> Really helps make longer haircuts a breeze.</li>
            <li> His hair isn&#x27;t sticking straight out at all.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely not as firm as the #8, but it is more solid than the #12.  </li>
            <li> They should use better quality plastic or some other material for this large size of comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair after getting tired of others not cutting it right.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviews say it is leaves a lot more hair than an 8 guard</li>
            <li> I pretty much just bought it to complete my set.</li>
            <li> This could be the cause of the bent/warped teeth, but trying to bend it back straight isn&#x27;t very easy, so I assume that they must have been in that bent state for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Next level an 8 a full circle around my head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that this is more of a problem with the #12 guard which is even longer (larger) and therefore more delicate.</li>
            <li> The problem that most people are not understanding is that initially Wahl and most other brands alike provide their longest guards being the #8 or 1 inch only.</li>
            <li> I was ok with that, as the nature of a bigger limbs would mean more leverage to bend them.</li>
            <li> The less hair, the better.</li>
            <li> Much better quality than the 1.5 inch blade I bought on Amazon (that one is black in color).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I finally found this larger clipper guide!  </li>
            <li> a decent set of clippers.</li>
            <li> Because the attachment is larger than your standard 1 through 8 size attachments, it does bend slightly more.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Too many use little or no combs these days.</li>
            <li> It is a little more flimsy than the stock combs but its not a problem at all.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to go go just a little bit more.</li>
            <li> A little flimsy but worked ok.</li>
            <li> This particular size is missing from most Clipper Kits.</li>
            <li> The plastic is not as strong as the other Wahl guide combs</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the size that was missing in my Wahl hair trimming kit, so I&#x27;m quite pleased with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> It gives a better haircut that what I was getting from the barber because it is never too short or too long.  </li>
            <li> : Spent a bunch of money buying a brand new clipper set because I didn&#x27;t think this Wahl Guide Comb would fit my Conair clippers..</li>
            <li> Built sturdy, clips on easy, simple to use, built to last.</li>
            <li> Right length for a mid level cut.</li>
            <li> I think it is too flexible for fine hair, it didn&#x27;t seem to do much and the parts it did do looked too choppy.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I just bought the new assembly for my clippers as well.</li>
            <li> Is very soft.</li>
            <li> but this one is pretty solid.</li>
            <li> one thing is that it makes noise but its nothing to big if your going to make your money back and its only to cut top at times.</li>
            <li> Pretty much what we expected.</li>
            <li> Teeth are a little wobbly, which is why I gave four stars but still seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair for the last 3 year and it makes it easy for a quick trim every month or any special events.</li>
            <li> cutting my own hair now... it took courage to do that for the first time!  </li>
            <li> This thing makes quick work of my hair and keeps me looking sharp every day.</li>
            <li> Hard to say I love it, it&#x27;s just a guard.</li>
            <li> doesnt leave the hair even at all, but that is to be expected with such huge combs.</li>
            <li> Just the length I wanted for my 9 year old.  </li>
            <li> Daughter is busy student:  </li>
            <li> Also, in most cases you can go to a beauty school/salon for trims as barber do fades for commonly.</li>
            <li> I have been using it to cut my hair for months so far, no issues.</li>
            <li> I ordered this cut my son&#x27;s (14 months old) hair without going to the barber shop.  </li>
            <li> The attachment locks firmly in place and remains secure while in use.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommended it to anyone who wants a longer buzz.</li>
            <li> so this is much appreciated, Will definitely be putting this to use.</li>
            <li> I realized my hair was shorter than when I used my old guide.</li>
            <li> The comb portion is very flimsy and seems like it will bend when in use and possibly will screw up trimming my hair.</li>
            <li> So to end my review i do not think it&#x27;s the manufactures fault as far as sturdiness of the guards are or are not, as for the fact that the guards shouldn&#x27;t be that long in the first place.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s pretty solid overall.</li>
            <li> have an older model and it secures solidly and does not snag hair.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li> This guard is quite long, and thus the prongs do shift around a bit while using it, but not so much as to affect its utility.</li>
            <li> I used it once or twice then got a little bold &amp; went with the #10.</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s the only one like this out there, especially since it&#x27;s Wahl, but the \\&quot;fingers\\&quot; or blades are much more flexible than the attachments that usually come.  </li>
            <li> I wish if it was a little stronger (it feels softer than original smaller parts).</li>
            <li> it was loud and it took several runs over my hair to cut it</li>
            <li> No regrets.</li>
            <li> This attachment performs exactly as expected and delivery was fast.  </li>
            <li> However, it is barely noticeable and it will not cause you any problems.  </li>
            <li> Was well made.&lt;br /&gt;Did a good job of cutting my hair at the #10 length.&lt;br /&gt;Stayed attached to clipper head.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived as promised.</li>
            <li> the other one vibrate too much.</li>
            <li> Like others say, yes, it&#x27;s true, the #8 standard clip bundled with all those sets is sometimes just plain too short of a cut.</li>
            <li> Wahl guide combs make it possible to do a good job cutting your hair yourself and avoid having to go to the barber.</li>
            <li> thinner than the ones that come with the clippers, but sturdy enough to do a good job of cutting hair.</li>
            <li> is a #8 which is just a little too small for the top / longest layer of a man&#x27;s haircut, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I was aware of the reviews stating that it is very flimsy and thin plastic.</li>
            <li> The blades are very flimsy which causes it to not hug tightly to my son&#x27;s head.  </li>
            <li> I cut my son&#x27;s thin, fine hair with a #8, and I felt that it was too short.  </li>
            <li> The plastic &#x27;blades&#x27; are somewhat far from each other.</li>
            <li> Just started cutting my own hair again after letting it grow long for a number of years.</li>
            <li> I read reviews that the #12 is hard to use, so I tried the #10 first.  </li>
            <li> I looked for this size in stores for a long time, and finally found it here.  </li>
            <li> I also have the one size above this and that one is a little unstable (soft).</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems pretty sturdy, not sure why these are white while all the others are black</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my way to save a couple of bucks through these hard economic times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve needed this for a long time.</li>
            <li> hopefully it lasts long.</li>
            <li> uneven lengths had to go to barber an get fixed.</li>
            <li> Did not take too long to get here.</li>
            <li> I use it to cut the hair of my two-year-old because I don&#x27;t want him to have such a military cut.</li>
            <li> As long as they do the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR</li>
            <li> I want it a little into the phase where you can kinda move it around a little with your fingers but not too much longer than that.</li>
            <li> They also sell other larger sizes like this one.  </li>
            <li> Did a good job cutting my thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> And the #10 is MUCH more sturdy than the crazy #12 which is a tad flimsy due to its unorthodox length &amp; construction.</li>
            <li> but it definitely works and cut me down to the size I needed.</li>
            <li> then I tapper down with smaller combs.  </li>
            <li> The white stand out in a sea of black</li>
            <li> Only wish it was in black.</li>
            <li> After going to various Sally beauty supply places around my house, I was a little bummed out.</li>
            <li> It works as expected, but arrived with the outside tines curved inwards, which makes it look a little flimsy.</li>
            <li> Only gave 4 stars because it was received slightly bent due to shipping and being made of flimsy plastic.</li>
            <li> they did the job, much better than cutting my hair all uneven with scissors</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted &amp; expected.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected from a $3 trim bit.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> You need to be careful when using to avoid causing it to come lose and cause severe vibration, but this is the nature of the clipper design.</li>
            <li> Quality is up to par as expected.</li>
            <li> It works as expected and saves trip to the barbers.</li>
            <li> It is not strong like the smaller ones</li>
            <li> but, like other reviews said, a bit flimsy.</li>
            <li> But other than that they are what you&#x27;re looking for</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways, I&#x27;m most disappointed that they arrived already warped.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have commented, you do have to comb the hair up to get an even cut.  </li>
            <li> Other reviewers have expressed some concern over the flimsiness of the comb.  </li>
            <li> these are a little flimsy but it what i expected.  </li>
            <li> (i have average hair thickness)</li>
            <li> just what i needed when they finally arrived they where a couple months late</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s takes longer than the average trim</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the quality is sub par.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need to pay a cent or worry about it getting out of hand when I&#x27;m tight on cash.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair a little longer</li>
            <li> Lets me keeps my pubes a little bit longer during the winter months.</li>
            <li> It works well for areas that you want a little longer than what you can achieve with the guides that come with the Wahl clippers.</li>
            <li> Bought this since my clippers set stopped at 8, and I wanted something a little longer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been tough finding a clip this big</li>
            <li> My only complaint was paying extra&lt;br /&gt;for shipping, and then receiving it late.</li>
            <li> It does not fit the shaver.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll become a pro after a few cuts.</li>
            <li> Just what I was missing.</li>
            <li> With this attachment, we can now trim up our boy&#x27;s hair in half the time and save lot of money from going to the barber!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I like the longer than an inch combs, but this one did the job like it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Buying this small replacement part saved us a bunch of money.</li>
            <li> I had been cutting my hair with a 1&amp;#34; attachment, but it was always just a little too short.</li>
            <li> Packaging was not very good.</li>
            <li> Bald is becoming boring.</li>
            <li> lately.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly different and vibrates like crazy.  </li>
            <li> works on a few random clippers of mine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been careful but I&#x27;m afraid of a slip up that might take out a chunk of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s obviously not as good as any of the clips</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe I just got a bad one, but be careful with this if you buy it.</li>
            <li> They are bendable which can be difficult when trying to do someone&#x27;s head logistically.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I bought Wahl pet clippers, they just don&#x27;t go through our dogs fur.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I need a bit longer guard.</li>
            <li> We were wrong.  </li>
            <li> But that doesn&#x27;t mean I wanna look like an idiot.</li>
            <li> Have been cutting my 3 boys hair for over 10 years.  </li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t realize it was that flimsy where I was afraid to use it.</li>
            <li> I think in a combo pack with the crazy lookin&#x27; Wolverine claw #12 clip.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just keep cutting my hair at 1\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> But with Wahl clippers and these guides, it&#x27;s almost like you can&#x27;t really go wrong!  </li>
            <li> i have a mohawk and hate cutting it with scissors</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m saving $10-15 every 6-8 weeks by cutting his hair at home, just like dad&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> This clip adds a quarter of an inch I believe in comparison to that stupid, dreaded #8 crap clip.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It does not fit the shaver. This just won&#x27;t work with the Wahl clippers I have &amp; I just bought the new assembly for my clippers as well. This comb won&#x27;t go onto the clippers.</li>
            <li> It just simply works.</li>
            <li> Just the right spacer for my hair. I&#x27;ve needed this for a long time. It saves me measuring the length of my hair with my fingers as I cut. Very convenient.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this. It gave me just the right length. it was loud and it took several runs over my hair to cut it (i have average hair thickness) so just be aware of those.</li>
            <li> Works as it should. Like other reviews say it is leaves a lot more hair than an 8 guard so you get short hair without being &amp;#34;buzzed&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> just what i needed when they finally arrived they where a couple months late but they where just what I needed</li>
            <li> Good length but cheaply made and doesn&#x27;t securely latch onto the clippers</li>
            <li> This was the clipper guide I needed.  Leaves my hair a little longer but I still get the neat, trim look I wanted.</li>
            <li> Used with the #12 the taper can be extended to a longer styling. Too many use little or no combs these days. Bald is becoming boring.</li>
            <li> Right length but, like other reviews said, a bit flimsy.</li>
            <li> this is great- if you want to cut your own hair but don&#x27;t want a \\&quot;buzz cut,\\&quot; buy this.  works great for me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clipper guide. Works perfectly.  What else can you say it about.</li>
            <li> great price...I cut my own hair and so far I haven&#x27;t had any issues with clip...it&#x27;s nice a sturdy...hopefully it lasts long.</li>
            <li> What is there to say? It&#x27;s a clipper guide, it does its job and nothing more.</li>
            <li> How was life possible without this? Now that I have this my hair will always be perfect and my life will never be the same!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t give a good cut, ended up to be uneven lengths had to go to barber an get fixed.</li>
            <li> Kinda flimsy but does the job!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice now and so far, I&#x27;m pretty happy with it. It&#x27;s sturdy and works very well. Much better than the Conair set we had before.</li>
            <li> Was as pictured. Just what I wanted &amp; expected.</li>
            <li> Just cut my hair last night with these. I&#x27;m not sure I like the longer than an inch combs, but this one did the job like it was supposed to. With the longer combs you have to go over your hair many more times to get all the long hairs, but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> Just what I had ordered and received it fast.  My son has this at his house now I have one at my house so I do not always have to drive to his house to cut his hair.</li>
            <li> Feels a little flimsy, but works great</li>
            <li> This definitely gets the job done and I think it&#x27;s the only one like this out there, especially since it&#x27;s Wahl, but the \\&quot;fingers\\&quot; or blades are much more flexible than the attachments that usually come.  They are bendable which can be difficult when trying to do someone&#x27;s head logistically.  But other than that they are what you&#x27;re looking for if you know the length you want</li>
            <li> It works great... It was a good buy for me</li>
            <li> I bought this product to trim my toddler&#x27;s hair without giving him a buzz cut. In order to get an even cut you must comb up the hair with a comb or with your fingers while sliding the clippers through it. Otherwise you won&#x27;t get much of a trim. It took a bit more of an effort than the standard length combs but if you&#x27;re looking for an at home hairdo that&#x27;s longer than it&#x27;s worth the effort. It&#x27;s takes longer than the average trim and if you&#x27;re doing your own hair you should have another person help out so the back is done evenly.</li>
            <li> The guide is a bit on the flimsy side, but it is plastic after all. In spite of this it still does a pretty reasonable job trimming up the pups for the warmer months. If you need a guide this size, it will do the job.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what else to say, really.  The guard fits on the clippers perfectly and it works just as expected.</li>
            <li> my husband gives my 3 years old hair cuts and I like when he leaves the top longer.  we also use the wahl #12 clipper</li>
            <li> Fits Great onto my Wahl Clippers made sturdy and properly labeled to easily know what guide it is. Great product</li>
            <li> Gets the job done. It is a little more flimsy than the stock combs but its not a problem at all. Works great!</li>
            <li> A handy gadget to attach to a Wahl clipper, to cut your own, or someone else&#x27;s hair! Built sturdy, clips on easy, simple to use, built to last. Get your snippers clippin&#x27;! This is a good deal, and a very good product.</li>
            <li> It is good that the 1.25 and 1.5 inch sizes are sold. I cut my own hair which saves me a lot of money each year. This is a good size for achieving a longer length of hair.</li>
            <li> Was well made.&lt;br /&gt;Did a good job of cutting my hair at the #10 length.&lt;br /&gt;Stayed attached to clipper head.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived as promised.</li>
            <li> Arrived with bent tines.  Tines bend easily.  They should use better quality plastic or some other material for this large size of comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended.</li>
            <li> I received the guide promptly, and it is a perfect replacement for our broken part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying this small replacement part saved us a bunch of money.</li>
            <li> got the Wahl #10 clipper guide comb, used it and it give me no problems. fit my wahl clippers and it cut my hair just the way I wanted it. I give this comb a big thumbs-up!</li>
            <li> Just the way it was described.&lt;br /&gt;I just cut my hair Saturday, works great and now my hair looks good!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great piece of equipment. Lets me keeps my pubes a little bit longer during the winter months.</li>
            <li> These puppies work like a charm!  I bought these clipper guards not wishing to look so shorn as one does when using the ol&#x27; #8 clipper guard.  They worked like a charm!  The guards do necessarily fit snuggly but I place finger where the guard connects to the clippers and there is no worry of botching the noggin.    Thanks for a good product!</li>
            <li> made of good plastic and is a nice UNIVERSAL attachment. works on a few random clippers of mine. a good buy</li>
            <li> It fits great and is just what I was looking for.  Great price, fast shipping, and cuts my hair to the length I want without needing scissors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I bought Wahl pet clippers, they just don&#x27;t go through our dogs fur. The shipper of the clipper guide comb was prompt and efficient.</li>
            <li> Fits all different Wahls I have owned.  Still works fine and snaps into place.  No cracks or anything.  This is my guard I use to trim the top of my head.</li>
            <li> This was delivered as just a clipper blade, no packaging of any kind except for the envelope it was mailed it.  The plastic is not as strong as the other Wahl guide combs I own, there is some flexibility.  When using it I think it is too flexible for fine hair, it didn&#x27;t seem to do much and the parts it did do looked too choppy.  I ended up having to clip everything even shorter with a different comb to even it all out.</li>
            <li> Snaps right onto our Wahl trimmer and my sons are quite happy to have that extra 1/4 inch!</li>
            <li> These do the job ok, but they make me nervous. For some reason this is the only one of my guards that rattles when it&#x27;s on my clippers. It even fell off once. I&#x27;ve been careful but I&#x27;m afraid of a slip up that might take out a chunk of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I just got a bad one, but be careful with this if you buy it.</li>
            <li> Works just as great as the originals. Love the length of this one. I use this once every 2 weeks and have never had an issue with it.</li>
            <li> It is a great add on to the standard combs that comes with the normal package. The plastic &#x27;blades&#x27; are somewhat far from each other.</li>
            <li> Great product, really quick shipping too!</li>
            <li> I need this item quick and the shipment went perfect</li>
            <li> It does the job but nothing really special. I pretty much just bought it to complete my set. Haven&#x27;t even used it yet.</li>
            <li> I use this guide all the time.  It&#x27;s the perfect length if you are wanting a clean cut without looking like you are in the military.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for. Did not take too long to get here. Didn&#x27;t cost to much either.</li>
            <li> Of course, it is not as firm and strong as the original one, but it is acceptable, I used it, and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> This is high quality, and a good way to get a longer cut than you usually can from the standard 1-8 guides that come with most clipper kits.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I needed. Did a good job cutting my thick curly hair. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I finally found this larger clipper guide!  This way I can trim my son&#x27;s hair without making it look too short.  I looked for this size in stores for a long time, and finally found it here.  The price was good, too.  Everything arrived quickly and in good condition.</li>
            <li> The #8 clipper guide that comes with most sets was just a bit too short to cut my hair to a manageable length (it made it spikey).  This provided the necessary length I needed.</li>
            <li> This clipper guide Fits the shaver perfect. The guide is strong. shipped is a nice box. I recommend if you have a Wahl shaver.</li>
            <li> I dont like the #8 clipper that comes with the wahl clippers. This one is a little bit longer and gives me a bit more length on the top. It is a bit flimsy but I dont care about that at all it doesnt affect the performance.</li>
            <li> Like this 1 1/4 guard for getting a longer cut. Gave Ma a buz cut with it she says she wishes they had a 1&#x27; 3/4. It&#x27;ll grow back ole girl.</li>
            <li> Bought the #10 and #12 to add to what came with the kit.  Have been cutting my 3 boys hair for over 10 years.  The #10 worked better than I expected.  Just the length I wanted for my 9 year old.  (used # 10 on top and #6 on side and #7 and #8 to blend. Very happy with product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been to a barber in 10 years because of this baby. Wahl should include this as a standard size.</li>
            <li> The product is sturdy and durable. It fits the Wahl clipper as described! Haven&#x27;t tried it yet but will put it to the test to see how the hair lines up.</li>
            <li> Excellent extension to 20 piece kit purchased on Amazon.  Daughter is busy student:  no time, no money... now can maintain pixie cut herself... even at 1 am during finals!</li>
            <li> This comb is ideal for a short, but not buzzed trim. Still leaves&lt;br /&gt;you with enough hair to style, but easy to maintain. I&#x27;ve been&lt;br /&gt;cutting my own hair for 10 years, and my only regret is that&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t make this purchase sooner. Huge difference from this&lt;br /&gt;1 1/4\\&quot; and the 1\\&quot; (#8), which is the largest comb sold in kits.&lt;br /&gt;I also recently purchased the #12 (1 1/2\\&quot;), which is a bit flimsy,&lt;br /&gt;so I was very pleased with the #10 here instead, but that&#x27;s a personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really write reviews that often, but I just wanted to&lt;br /&gt;make people aware that it really is that easy with these guides&lt;br /&gt;and a decent set of clippers. They are an investment. I hope by&lt;br /&gt;writing this, some of you will take my advice and save&lt;br /&gt;yourselves some money! My only complaint was paying extra&lt;br /&gt;for shipping, and then receiving it late. Nonetheless, do yourselves&lt;br /&gt;a favor, folks.</li>
            <li> Great product and is exactly what I expected. Only gave 4 stars because it was received slightly bent due to shipping and being made of flimsy plastic.</li>
            <li> I just bought these and the #12 along with the Wahl cordless designer clippers to cut my own hair on the top so far they are awesome they did the job, much better than cutting my hair all uneven with scissors lol.</li>
            <li> Excellent for grooming my dog.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.  Quick delivery, too.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected from a $3 trim bit.  It&#x27;ll save me time/$ from having to go get it cut.</li>
            <li> I bought this clipper along with the Wahl #12 clipper, and I use the #12. It works OK for a cheap haircut without the look of an actual shaved head which is exactly what I wanted, it&#x27;s just that the #12 is better at it. So there&#x27;s nothing wrong with it, I just bought both of them and like the #12 better.</li>
            <li> I like how it is able to trim it it down to length, I still use scissors to get the right look and cut evenly but def. worth a buy.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this guide!!</li>
            <li> Leave my hair with the perfect lenght (side &amp; back), very good tool to have. The guide arrived on time and as described by seller. Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> Great product. ..use it all the time</li>
            <li> This is great for people don&#x27;t know how short they want their hair to be cut. Then U can use the smaller number so they won&#x27;t get scarce their hair will be to short.</li>
            <li> I started cutting my own hair 5 years ago when the economy collapsed. So easy just take your time and learn. I use a 4 around my head above my ears and back of head in that area. Next level an 8 a full circle around my head. The top a 10. To get a nice finish clean the edges around the head with scissors and around the neck at the back use a new razor you shave with to get  straight clean lines. Practice you&#x27;ll become a pro after a few cuts.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, sturdy Wahl construction and cuts just the length I wanted. One inch was a little short so this was perfect!</li>
            <li> Seems sturdy enough. It works well for areas that you want a little longer than what you can achieve with the guides that come with the Wahl clippers.</li>
            <li> I bought the #12 (1.5 inch) clip a while back, also a product made by WAHL. The problem with the #12 clip is that it&#x27;s way to flimsy, as acknowledged. But I didn&#x27;t realize it was that flimsy where I was afraid to use it. So I opted for the #10 clip hoping better results. This thing is solid! It&#x27;s obviously not as good as any of the clips #8 and down because they&#x27;re just made with more comb guides and shorter, so more stout by nature, but this one is pretty solid. The different groves do tend to expand but it says in shape well enough for a job well done. The white stand out in a sea of black so you can pick it out easier. But it&#x27;s pretty solid overall. It would be nicer if it&#x27;s more sturdy but it&#x27;s great for what&#x27;s out there.</li>
            <li> Just like my barber&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought this! We have the 24-piece Wahl standard clipper set but the largest guard included with the set is a #8 which is just a little too small for the top / longest layer of a man&#x27;s haircut, in my opinion. This guard is quite long, and thus the prongs do shift around a bit while using it, but not so much as to affect its utility. I&#x27;ve read that this is more of a problem with the #12 guard which is even longer (larger) and therefore more delicate. If you&#x27;re debating buying this or the #12, buy this one first and wait - it might be all you need!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, this is the Wahl set we have now and love: http://www.amazon.com/Wahl-79524-2501-Chrome-24-Piece-Haircut/dp/B0026IBSVE/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_hg_5?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;0D3HQ2AFRCMQV3ZTAS2R</li>
            <li> I looked everywhere for a #10 guide, ultimately finding this one.  It works as expected, but arrived with the outside tines curved inwards, which makes it look a little flimsy.</li>
            <li> this is a good product, i use  it every time when its time</li>
            <li> Great product, cuts well.</li>
            <li> The blades are very flimsy which causes it to not hug tightly to my son&#x27;s head.  The guide combs that came with our set have one more prong and are made of harder plastic.  It gets the job done, but with multiple passes.</li>
            <li> I just ordered the #10 and #12 guards. I&#x27;ll be getting them soon. The problem that most people are not understanding is that initially Wahl and most other brands alike provide their longest guards being the #8 or 1 inch only. The fact that Wahl provides these guards longer than 1 inch is great, but you can&#x27;t expect them to be built as well as the standard 1/8-1 inch guards. I&#x27;m a barber myself, so when you ask for a cut longer than 1 inch it requires us to use shears (scissors) not pull out a #10 or #12 and have our client bend over for their hair to stick up. Also, in most cases you can go to a beauty school/salon for trims as barber do fades for commonly. So to end my review i do not think it&#x27;s the manufactures fault as far as sturdiness of the guards are or are not, as for the fact that the guards shouldn&#x27;t be that long in the first place. So i would just be happy that Wahl makes the #10 and #12 guard.</li>
            <li> Fits my Wahl clippers nice and snug.  Works as expected. No rattling. Wish I had more of these at longer lengths.</li>
            <li> My son loves this. He can use this blade to cut his own hair, precise and not too short.</li>
            <li> Great accessory to add to my wahl clippers, and an excellent way to save money on haircuts. With a sturdy guide like this, even those who have never cut hair can feel confident to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Just started cutting my own hair again after letting it grow long for a number of years. The biggest attachment I had was a one inch and I wanted to go go just a little bit more. This fits my wall clippers perfectly and works very well.</li>
            <li> Seems to work Ok.  Would be better with more tines or teeth to make it stronger and comb hair better.</li>
            <li> I was aware of the reviews stating that it is very flimsy and thin plastic. I was ok with that, as the nature of a bigger limbs would mean more leverage to bend them. However, the limbs are about 1-2mm thinner then the stock attachments I have with my Wahl, so they could have found ways to make it stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I&#x27;m most disappointed that they arrived already warped. I bought #12 and #10 and they were wedged together teeth into teeth in the package. This could be the cause of the bent/warped teeth, but trying to bend it back straight isn&#x27;t very easy, so I assume that they must have been in that bent state for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would rate one star, but two because they were cheap and the only ones available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve added pictures to show what I&#x27;m talking about.</li>
            <li> Fit my color coded clipper perfectly. The 1 1/4&amp;#34; guide is just the right length for me. Would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> my wahl clipper is pretty much done so I use this with my panasonic trimmer (holding it on). It works great. I also have the one size above this and that one is a little unstable (soft).</li>
            <li> I received exactly what I needed. I fit my clippers and worked as advertised.</li>
            <li> It fits and works fine.</li>
            <li> This was just the size I needed to cut my son&#x27;s hair since he doesn&#x27;t want it too short.  Works great on thick hair.  Also ordered the #12 clipper guide comb but I can&#x27;t get it to grip the hair very well, perhaps the hair has to be much longer in order for it to work.</li>
            <li> So, imagine my excitement when I found it on Amazon! Oh yeah. I had the number 8 clipper and the number 12, but the former cut my hair way to short, and the latter not enough. After going to various Sally beauty supply places around my house, I was a little bummed out. I come on here and bam, there it is. All of Wahl&#x27;s clips are made well (with the exception of one that doesn&#x27;t fit snug against the actual clipper unit, but, what are your gonna do)and have saved me thousands of dollars in haircuts over the years. Very excited. Should&#x27;ve known better than to look elsewhere, first. Shame on me.</li>
            <li> Does the job that it is intended to do. Unfortunately I need a bit longer guard. Only wish it was in black.</li>
            <li> It is not strong like the smaller ones but it does the job. I have been using it to cut my hair for months so far, no issues. I wish if it was a little stronger (it feels softer than original smaller parts).</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I bought a Wahl hair clipper SET and added this #10 and a #12 because they didn&#x27;t come with it.  All Wahl clipper guide combs are interchangeable with ANY Wahl product as far as I know, so you KNOW it will fit, first of all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m cutting my own hair now... it took courage to do that for the first time!  But with Wahl clippers and these guides, it&#x27;s almost like you can&#x27;t really go wrong!  I started with these longer guides because I was leery of how this was going to work, but it all works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never go to a barber again... I&#x27;ll never wait in line for a chair again... I&#x27;ll never pay for another hair cut!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if I can cut my OWN hair, it would be completely EASY to cut someone else... like your kid&#x27;s hair.  &amp;#34;nuff said</li>
            <li> I ordered this cut my son&#x27;s (14 months old) hair without going to the barber shop.  It works nicely - It is a perfect length without looking like a buzz cut.  Like other reviewers have commented, you do have to comb the hair up to get an even cut.  Good Buy!</li>
            <li> Nothing more for me to say!!!  Yes it doesn&#x27;t feel very sturdy, but it works just fine for me.  I use it to cut the hair of my two-year-old because I don&#x27;t want him to have such a military cut.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty, fits perfect, works great! My husband is able to cut his own hair now at a length that looks best on him and it was worth the money!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted. Because it wasnt included in the original Wahl pack. I didnt know they made this size clipper!. Definitely satisfied</li>
            <li> The guide is sturdy and convenient.  It is easy to put on clippers and it gives consistent results. I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the best fit in the world but it definitely works and cut me down to the size I needed. Quick shipping too</li>
            <li> It works as if it came along with Wahl clipper. It works good just like other combs in the wahl clipper set.</li>
            <li> Great, blades are not too soft.  Good addition to the kit pieces.</li>
            <li> This clip attachment is a must if you have a compatible clipper &amp; like to cut your own hair or the hair of others/ friends or family. Like others say, yes, it&#x27;s true, the #8 standard clip bundled with all those sets is sometimes just plain too short of a cut. The #8 leaves you just on the verge of the point where your hair stops being in that \\&quot;spiky/ buzzed\\&quot; phased. If I&#x27;m gonna cut my hair short I want it a little into the phase where you can kinda move it around a little with your fingers but not too much longer than that. This clip adds a quarter of an inch I believe in comparison to that stupid, dreaded #8 crap clip. This one is considered the #10 clip. And it&#x27;s etched/ written on the clip itself. I bought this I think in a combo pack with the crazy lookin&#x27; Wolverine claw #12 clip. The #12 is alright, I guess. I used it once or twice then got a little bold &amp; went with the #10. And the #10 is MUCH more sturdy than the crazy #12 which is a tad flimsy due to its unorthodox length &amp; construction. It&#x27;s summertime here &amp; it&#x27;s been HOT! lately. The less hair, the better. But that doesn&#x27;t mean I wanna look like an idiot. The #10, at least with me, left me with a excellent amount of hair up top. I&#x27;ve NEVER been happy with the #8 length. EVER! I would suggest a person get the combo pack &amp; just fork out a couple extra bucks &amp; get both clips. Who know? Someone else might prefer the #12 to the #10 &amp; then one of your friends one day says \\&quot;Hey, cut my hair! Wait... You don&#x27;t have a clip in between 8 &amp; 12? Dude...\\&quot; :D The combo pack was priced alright &amp; it did ship &amp; arrive fairly quickly. I would DEFINITELY recommend this as a MUST-BUY! for any of my friends or family members that own &amp; clipper that these work with.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the size that was missing in my Wahl hair trimming kit, so I&#x27;m quite pleased with this purchase.  What more can you say.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described... Thanks. It cut perfectly.  I can now cut my own hair!  Perfect thanks love it! amazing Great</li>
            <li> I ordered this #10 and also a #12 (separate order) and they both arrived very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a conair clipper and had just ordered a new Wahl clipper set thinking this guide wouldn&#x27;t fit the conair I have, since that&#x27;s what my research showed me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I tried it out, and it snaps right in place on my Conair clippers and fits well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems pretty sturdy, not sure why these are white while all the others are black but, I don&#x27;t really care. As long as they do the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR: Spent a bunch of money buying a brand new clipper set because I didn&#x27;t think this Wahl Guide Comb would fit my Conair clippers.. Turns out, it does!</li>
            <li> Good idea, but I now see why the standard limit is 1\\&quot;. To make these work they&#x27;d need to made from better material, such as metal. (Remember when things--even cars--were made of metal and worked perfectly for many years, and didn&#x27;t pollute the oceans, and could be melted down and recycled into new products?) Plastic just can&#x27;t take the stress at this length and the tines bend back and forth too easily. I&#x27;ll just keep cutting my hair at 1\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This is a very reliable product. This is my second time purchasing it, my first one was dropped while connected to the clippers, but this is great for a college student like me who is tight with money and loves to avoid spending $20 every time I get a hair cut. I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair for the last 3 year and it makes it easy for a quick trim every month or any special events.</li>
            <li> Bought this since my clippers set stopped at 8, and I wanted something a little longer. The reviews on the #12 seemed a bit worrysome so I went with the #10. I think I&#x27;ll try the 12, but the #10&#x27;s 1 &amp;1/2&amp;#34; seems to be a good length.</li>
            <li> This guide comb definitely does it&#x27;s job, it helps make trimming my family&#x27;s hair a lot more easier. No regrets.</li>
            <li> It is a good length. It gives a better haircut that what I was getting from the barber because it is never too short or too long.  Paid for itself the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> This guard is just the right length and feels well-made.  It is not flimsy or cheap-feeling like you might expect.</li>
            <li> Great for longish men&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Great clipper comb for the top of my husband&#x27;s head.... then I tapper down with smaller combs.  Previously thought an Oster comb would fit OK on our Wahl unit.  We were wrong.  It&#x27;s slightly different and vibrates like crazy.  This fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> i got this clipper guide cuz i cut my own hair i have a mohawk and hate cutting it with scissors cuz it take to much time this leaves the perfect size to spike it up good for blowouts to fast shipping to</li>
            <li> Did the job well. I had been cutting my hair with a 1&amp;#34; attachment, but it was always just a little too short. The 1 1/4&amp;#34; was perfect. Teeth are a little wobbly, which is why I gave four stars but still seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> If you bought the Wahl hair clippers, it will include guides up to 1\\&quot;.  They also sell other larger sizes like this one.  I have bought the size 10 (1.25\\&quot;), 12 (1.5\\&quot;) and 14 (2\\&quot;).  The size 14 one was way too wobbly, and fell apart. The 10 and 12 are great though.  For my hair, I use a 10 up on top, and a 5 on the sides.</li>
            <li> This is the largest guide comb that still has rigid guides on it.  I use this every time I cut my hair.  The number 12 is too floppy to easily use.</li>
            <li> Worked great and arrived in a timely manner! My husband was glad to get a 1 1/4 attachment! Thanks!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right. I cut my own hair. It&#x27;s my way to save a couple of bucks through these hard economic times. It clips onto my Wahl clippers (I think they&#x27;re Wahl) and I can cut my hair. Sometimes I&#x27;ll use 2 mirrors. My wife shakes her head at me. I still love her though. I think my hair looks great. Oh and the item arrived in good time too.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be made strong and works great. It is comfortable when rolling of the head when using.</li>
            <li> Great add on size to any of the Wahl clippers.&lt;br /&gt;I have an older model and it secures solidly and does not snag hair.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;Made In USA</li>
            <li> This attachment performs exactly as expected and delivery was fast.  Other reviewers have expressed some concern over the flimsiness of the comb.  This was a concern of mine as well.  Because the attachment is larger than your standard 1 through 8 size attachments, it does bend slightly more.  However, it is barely noticeable and it will not cause you any problems.  The attachment locks firmly in place and remains secure while in use.  I have been cutting my own hair with Wahl clippers for over twelve years now and I can tell you that this attachment is a worthwhile purchase.  I also purchased the #12 and now I&#x27;m set.  Once you master the technique, you will save yourself time and money.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for men that want to buzz their own head but want a little longer of a top length.&lt;br /&gt;I use this in combination with a #12 to get a nice fade.&lt;br /&gt;This is built better then my #12 and is not too flimsy considering the size of it.&lt;br /&gt;This clips on my cheap Wahl clipper.</li>
            <li> good stability compared to the 1.5 inch attachment that bends.</li>
            <li> came in with no problems, shipped perfectly with combs all straight, hopefuully my hair cuts good with these ones! !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this too many times to count, I like my hair longer then a size #8 and this was absolutely perfect. I&#x27;ve cut my own hair for years now and this made it that much easier. I would definitely recommended it to anyone who wants a longer buzz.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect length for my winter hair cut.  You need to be careful when using to avoid causing it to come lose and cause severe vibration, but this is the nature of the clipper design.</li>
            <li> Good but is not like the original combs from wahl. Is very soft. Anyway it works and it is wonderful to have a 10&amp;#34; comb</li>
            <li> Wahl guide combs make it possible to do a good job cutting your hair yourself and avoid having to go to the barber. If you want to save money, cutting your own hair is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Fit my conair clippers well.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what you would expect. Really helps make longer haircuts a breeze. Quality is up to par as expected.</li>
            <li> With this attachment, we can now trim up our boy&#x27;s hair in half the time and save lot of money from going to the barber!  Worked perfect!!</li>
            <li> Fits on a cheap Conair clipper that I have.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Used today and got a good result.</li>
            <li> Works just fine! Pretty much what we expected. Delivered on time. Lightweight but sturdy. Serves it&#x27;s purpose well. Overall very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Right length for a mid level cut. I don&#x27;t trust my wife to get the length the same on the top so this provides piece of mind.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re looking to cut your own hair this is almost a must assuming you dont want an army style cut every time.</li>
            <li> I clip my top with this and I do my sides and back with a 7/8\\&quot; and wear a faux hawk. This thing makes quick work of my hair and keeps me looking sharp every day. I can cut my hair as often as I want and I don&#x27;t need to pay a cent or worry about it getting out of hand when I&#x27;m tight on cash. I use a Wahl clipper too and it fits on there perfectly.</li>
            <li> I ordered this clipper guide because the Wahl clipper I bought had guide combs only to 1&amp;#34;.  This is the perfect size for me and works very well.</li>
            <li> This clipper attachment was worth every penny.  It was the exact length I needed and is the official Wahl brand.</li>
            <li> Perfect, thanks! It&#x27;s been tough finding a clip this big so this is much appreciated, Will definitely be putting this to use.</li>
            <li> This is definitely not as firm as the #8, but it is more solid than the #12.  Overall, I&#x27;m very glad to have this extension in my set.</li>
            <li> Just exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> It works fine. Thank you.</li>
            <li> As advertised. Packaging was not very good.</li>
            <li> I got this one and the 1.5&amp;#34; guide to trim hair on the top of my head.  The blades are much longer than the 1&amp;#34; guide that came with my Wahl clipper and therefore they are not as &amp;#34;sturdy&amp;#34; but this work wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Good item if you are looking for a short hair cut. Nice quality, feels sturdy enough. Much better quality than the 1.5 inch blade I bought on Amazon (that one is black in color).</li>
            <li> Used it on my kids, and left the hair just where I wanted it. Hard to say I love it, it&#x27;s just a guard. But it worked.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair after getting tired of others not cutting it right.  Just wish there was an easier way to cut the back</li>
            <li> I love my Wahl clippers</li>
            <li> these are a little flimsy but it what i expected.  they work just fine and make it easy for keeping the hair a bit longer.</li>
            <li> A little flimsy but worked ok.</li>
            <li> this for our son-in-law soon as I saw it for sale here. Now he can cut his hair at home! This particular size is missing from most Clipper Kits. It works as expected and saves trip to the barbers.</li>
            <li> thinner than the ones that come with the clippers, but sturdy enough to do a good job of cutting hair.</li>
            <li> Needed a #10 for my hairstyle. It works as it&#x27;s made to work so that&#x27;s good...</li>
            <li> perfect. doesnt leave the hair even at all, but that is to be expected with such huge combs. well worth it, would buy again.</li>
            <li> Just what I was missing.</li>
            <li> Added value to any barber&#x27;s equipment. .</li>
            <li> If you put these side to side it looks like a tidal wave.  I got a good haircut.  People on the street complemented me.  &amp;#34;Hey, number ten comb, nice,&amp;#34; was heard often by this reviewer.  The comb, it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> After using this guide to cut my hair I realized my hair was shorter than when I used my old guide. After comparing it side by side with a 1\\&quot; guide, I determined the actual depth is about 1 1/16\\&quot;, not 1 1/4\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I cut my son&#x27;s thin, fine hair with a #8, and I felt that it was too short.  8 is the biggest size my clipper set came with, so I started looking around to see if there were bigger sizes.  I read reviews that the #12 is hard to use, so I tried the #10 first.  I used the 10 on the top and a 5 on the sides and my son&#x27;s hair looks great!  His hair isn&#x27;t sticking straight out at all.  I don&#x27;t even think I need to try the 12.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very glad I got brave enough to try home haircuts.  He&#x27;s little, and no one cares right now if his hair is perfect.  I&#x27;m saving $10-15 every 6-8 weeks by cutting his hair at home, just like dad&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> This # 10 clipper guide is working very good. Now I can get right hair cut. That was good choice to buy it</li>
            <li> The #10 clipper guide comb is not flimsy like the #12 guide comb.  Works okay for in between hair cuts.</li>
            <li> This shipped very quick and fits my trimmer well. My only complaint is that the quality is sub par. The comb portion is very flimsy and seems like it will bend when in use and possibly will screw up trimming my hair.</li>
            <li> I had been asked to buy this clipper guide at my shop so i decided to get it.. I got tipped by the 1st person i cut their hair with.. one thing is that it makes noise but its nothing to big if your going to make your money back and its only to cut top at times.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a bigger one. I have ordered a #12 and this one. the other one vibrate too much. this is good even though it vibrate little bit more than the #8</li>
