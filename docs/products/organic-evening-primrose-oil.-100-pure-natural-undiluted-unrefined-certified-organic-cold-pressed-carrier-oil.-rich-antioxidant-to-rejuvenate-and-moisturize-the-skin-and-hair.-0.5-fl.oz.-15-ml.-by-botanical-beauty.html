            <li> Though I&#x27;m not sure if the product is right for my skin yet, it seems to be as described.</li>
            <li> Applied topically it helps to moisturize and soften the skin,  can rejuvenate tired and aging skin, can make tired eyes look fresher, and is an approved treatment for the alleviation of the symptoms of eczema, and has also been found effective in treating dermatitis in various forms.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since reading other reviews, I plan on trying it mixed with my daily moisturizer for my face.</li>
            <li> This oil has a very unpleasant aroma and I would not recommend using it straight from the bottle unless you&#x27;re able to ignore it.</li>
            <li> Massage it in around the eye and lashes to Keep your lashes long too!</li>
            <li> regulates the functioning of the oil glands, so it can help dry, combination or oily skin</li>
            <li> I purchased the to add to my shampoo and conditioner because my hair had become so dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m honestly not expecting this to be a miracle eczema treatment since thus far, only hydrocortisone creams seem to have any sort of effect.</li>
            <li> Primrose Oil is high in antioxidants, gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), and Omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids and other essential fatty acids.</li>
            <li> The amount is much smaller than other oils I have used!</li>
            <li> primrose oil on the affected areas and examined my hand a few hours later.</li>
            <li> product arrived quicker than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I use a few drops of this product mixed with lotion for tender/sore breasts.  </li>
            <li> Oil comes in a dark glass bottle with glass eye-dropper.</li>
            <li> I unfortunately did not use it frequently enough to see any other difference but will definitely continue it&#x27;s use</li>
            <li> I prefer this just slightly over coconut oil because it doesn&#x27;t seem to feel as greasy nor does it smell as much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> wrinkles are less visible.</li>
            <li> I just wish it didn&#x27;t smell so odd.</li>
            <li> I add a few drops.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it works to clears my skin as advertised, but it doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> use a few drops every morning and night on my face as a moisturizer and it has helped my skin a lot!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always hesitant when buying a product not USDA inspected, but this item is so hard to find anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Having said that, I take reviews seriously</li>
            <li> It was not good.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with the oil.  </li>
            <li> I was having terrible pains in both breast for a long time, this has helped reduce that pain to wear I hardly feel anything.</li>
            <li> Sadly this did not work for me.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m an avid user of essential oils which means that I&#x27;m always on the lookout for new oils/carrier oils so I can mix up new concoctions. I&#x27;m always mixing up new face washes, hair conditioners, moisturizers, and trying out new concoctions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this oil mixed with jojoba for hair conditioner and I gotta say it has made my hair look super healthy and has made it very soft. I&#x27;ve also heard its very good for skin aliments so the next time I get an acne breakout I will definitely be giving it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this seems like a really great carrier oil. I prefer this just slightly over coconut oil because it doesn&#x27;t seem to feel as greasy nor does it smell as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to snag a discount in exchange for testing it out and leaving a review. Having said that, I take reviews seriously and I&#x27;m under no obligation to leave a good review. The opinions above are my own and my honest opinion is that this is a fantastic carrier oil for anyones essential oil collection!</li>

            <li> The product is great, love it, highly recommends everyone get themselves a bottle. I would highly recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve added Evening Primrose Oil to the home made Shea Butter Cream I make for several years now since discovering how beneficial it is for the skin. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product by Botanical Beauty because it meets the standards I set for the essential oils I use in my skin care products: it&#x27;s organic, 100% pure, natural, cold pressed, unrefined, cruelty free, and the country of origin is the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evening Primrose Oil is high in antioxidants, gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), and Omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids and other essential fatty acids.

            <li> From what I can tell this is as pure of a oil I have found, high quality! I use it on my eyes at night and have liked the results.</li>
            <li> Sadly this did not work for me.  I bought it in hopes it would help my eczema but did nothing.  It did come on time, was packaged well and was not rancid so that&#x27;s a plus!</li>
            <li> I am not happy with the oil.  Can&#x27;t get over the smell to put it on my face.  Does not smell  good.</li>
            <li> smells and feels great in my hair</li>
            <li> this product is a gift to someone.</li>
            <li> This oil has a nice texture to it and my skin felt nice the next day. I unfortunately did not use it frequently enough to see any other difference but will definitely continue it&#x27;s use</li>
            <li> I use it every night  as a moisturizer. And I love the little dropper, keeps it sanitary.</li>
            <li> Nice facial oil or carrier oil.</li>
            <li> I was recently introduced to the wonderful world of essential oils and thus am always on the look out for new carrier oils. There were 2 things that surprised me about this oil. One was the size. The amount is much smaller than other oils I have used! At 0.5fl oz (15mL), there isn&#x27;t a lot of product to go around so I suppose you should use it sparingly. Two was the smell. This oil has a very unpleasant aroma and I would not recommend using it straight from the bottle unless you&#x27;re able to ignore it. I mix in a drop of peppermint or cinnamon oil and the smell is completely negated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle claims that organic primrose oil is one of the best oils to rejuvenate and regenerate skin tissues, and seeing as I sometimes have eczema flare-ups on my hands, I was interested to see if it could do anything to help. My eczema is a mild case (assuming from the pics on google). I spread some of the evening primrose oil on the affected areas and examined my hand a few hours later. Of course I wasn&#x27;t magically cured anything, but the oil did help to moisturize the area and relieve dryness. Maybe with continued use it could help but I&#x27;m honestly not expecting this to be a miracle eczema treatment since thus far, only hydrocortisone creams seem to have any sort of effect. But if you&#x27;re looking for a moisturizer and wish to forgo the steroid creams, this one will work well to relieve some of the eczema symptoms. I received this product at a discount (not for free) in exchange for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I used it a few times seemed ok...honestly I will try to use it everyday for a couple months.  I don&#x27;t see why it wouldn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;ve been using the capsules for 18 months now they seem to work real good.  I was having terrible pains in both breast for a long time, this has helped reduce that pain to wear I hardly feel anything.</li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;m not sure if the product is right for my skin yet, it seems to be as described. I&#x27;m always hesitant when buying a product not USDA inspected, but this item is so hard to find anywhere else. It can give your skin a nice &amp;#34;dewey&amp;#34; but not too shiny appearance. I liked that it came in a small bottle-- convenient for travel. Delivery was speedy too.</li>
            <li> The is a &amp;#34;God sent&amp;#34;. I have been using evening primrose for a year. It is amazing! It is great to use with tea tree for arthritis. I highly recommend it..</li>
            <li> I like it. It arrived on time and the packaging was great. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I mix it with vitamin-E oil and use it as a eye cream! Better than a lot of the eye creams out there. Massage it in around the eye and lashes to Keep your lashes long too!</li>
            <li> I mix this with my my moisturizer in the evening.  I alternate with the organic rose hip oil and I love both.  I love the way it feels on my skin since this is a light oil.  My skin looks and feels so much smoother and fine lines/wrinkles are less visible.</li>
            <li> Good product but the size of the bottle is not economical.</li>
            <li> Since I have sensitive, oily-dehydrated, acne prone skin, I don&#x27;t have a lot of choices when it comes to oils for use on hair or skin.  Evening primrose oil is one of those choices. I just wish it didn&#x27;t smell so odd.</li>
            <li> This product is good for women who have fibrocystic breasts. It is very soothing! It is oily, but it soaks in quickly and leaves no residue. It doesn&#x27;t really have a fragrance that I can tell.</li>
            <li> The oil is very light and has a agreeable scent. I&#x27;m not sure if it works to clears my skin as advertised, but it doesn&#x27;t make me break out. I&#x27;ll keep using and update as time goes on.</li>
            <li> Received this oil today and well please with it! Planning on using it to its full potential happy first time customer</li>
            <li> Love primrose oil. I make a lot of DYI products. I use it in body butter, body wash and more..</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing for people with acne prone skin because it&#x27;s high in linolenic acid. This is a good quality oil!&lt;br /&gt;I use a few drops every morning and night on my face as a moisturizer and it has helped my skin a lot! Sometimes I&lt;br /&gt;Mix with a drop or 2 of lavender oil for it&#x27;s anti bacterial properties.</li>
            <li> I purchased the to add to my shampoo and conditioner because my hair had become so dry and brittle. I add a few drops. It has made a significant improvement in my hairs texture! I love it!</li>
            <li> I used it in a home made lotion for my daughter&#x27;s eczema.  Oil comes in a dark glass bottle with glass eye-dropper.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT FOR CREATING LOTIONS!!!!</li>
            <li> I had twice this year an issue with an allergic reaction on my face. I did not know what it came from .  So I got off of everything I was using and stuck strictly to oils.  Wham !  My complexion is better than before using products on the market.  Essential oils will all I will use now.</li>
            <li> product arrived quicker than I expected.  I use a few drops of this product mixed with lotion for tender/sore breasts.  It is very effective in taking away the tenderness.  Since reading other reviews, I plan on trying it mixed with my daily moisturizer for my face.</li>
            <li> Dynamic, organic evening primrose oil!
