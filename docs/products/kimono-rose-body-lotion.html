            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a nice rose smell, this lotion is NOT it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t smell a rose scent at all.</li>

            <li>One of my favorite scents in body wash and lotion.</li>

            <li>Lovely scent</li>
            <li>It arrived safely and promptlyðŸ˜ƒ</li>
            <li>I love this body creme.  </li>
            <li>I originally started using the Kimono Rose because it was a raffle that I had won.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent - light, not overpowering -</li>
            <li>Just pleasant, classic scents.</li>
            <li>I get tons of compliments on the fresh rose smell.</li>
            <li>or if you just want to smell special - delic!</li>
            <li>I enjoy using it every day, I would buy it again.</li>
            <li>The texture is silky smooth, and after using this, I smell like roses all day, but the scent is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>This one is a completely contemporary take on rose.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my splurge special treat.</li>
            <li>Just the right combo!</li>
            <li>Its nice to see a seller take the extra step with the communication to make sure to buyer is receiving exactly what they want.</li>
            <li>It was only when I decided to pass on the body wash to my daughter, that I got a true whiff of the scent of the Kimono Rose.  </li>
            <li>All the great scents disappear after a few years . . .  </li>
            <li>Kimono Rose products are an essential luxury.  </li>
            <li>This lotion has such a light scent that it is great for everyday use.</li>
            <li>my favorite lotion, on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>soft, unique, feminine scent.  </li>
            <li>and the product moisturizes skin very well.</li>
            <li>and I truly appreciated that.</li>
            <li>However, it is so much easier to purchase online.</li>
            <li>Bought this as a gift for my mom since she really likes the way the shower gel smells.</li>
            <li>Luxurious and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I think from now on I will check to see who the supplier really is and order through their website rather than Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>I received a quick response back ( over the New Years holiday too ) that the product would be shipped right away</li>
            <li>Had purchased this in past - really nice smell.</li>
            <li>My daughter-in-law first introduced me to the product years ago, and I&#x27;m sold on it completely.</li>
            <li>I had previously purchased this product from a local spa and loved the soft, feminine scent.  </li>
            <li>always getting compliments every time i put it on because it smells natural and feminine !</li>
            <li>I love the delicate scent.  </li>
            <li>It is not overpowering and makes my skin feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this seller and would definitely purchase from them again.</li>
            <li>I order a new bottle instantly</li>
            <li>It has such a clean, delicate floral scent, and is not greasy to the touch.  </li>

            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Their scents aren&#x27;t over-the-top, overly sweet, or overly fake smelling.</li>
            <li> Very subtle.</li>
            <li> At $22 a bottle this was an expensive lesson to learn.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed with product!</li>

            <li> I LOVE this Thymes Kimono Rose Body Lotion - its smells absolutely wonderful, and its silky smooth and leaves my skin feeling and smelling amazing ! I have received SO many compliments on the scent. Great customer service and communication by the seller ! The item is listed as \\&quot;body creme\\&quot; in the photo, however its actually the body lotion, which I knew this was what I was getting. The seller did contact me to let me know the image shown and the actual product were different ( body creme vs body lotion ) and asked if I still wanted to move forward with the purchase. I thought it was great of the seller to contact me to clarify and I truly appreciated that. I still wanted the item, and responded to the seller. I received a quick response back ( over the New Years holiday too ) that the product would be shipped right away and it was !! I highly recommend this seller and would definitely purchase from them again.

            <li> Thymes makes very nice body wash and lotion. It&#x27;s my splurge special treat. Luxurious and very moisturizing. I love all their scents but Kimono Rose is my favorite. Their scents aren&#x27;t over-the-top, overly sweet, or overly fake smelling. Just pleasant, classic scents.</li>
            <li> Looooovvee this stuff!</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion ever. Not oily and has the perfect scent.  I use it everyday. I get tons of compliments on the fresh rose smell. One of my favorite things!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best smelling lotions by the Thymes company. I would also recommend Lotus Santal by Thymes.</li>
            <li> This lotion combines the scent of roses and jasmine for a truly remarkable and unique fragrance. The texture is silky smooth, and after using this, I smell like roses all day, but the scent is not overpowering. it is one of the best products in the Thymes collection.</li>
            <li> This lotion has such a light scent that it is great for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I originally started using the Kimono Rose because it was a raffle that I had won.  I have been hooked ever since.  And my daughter is now also.  I love the way it smells and feels.  Not greasy at all.  A great product.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I was not satisfied with my order due to the fact that Amazon pictures and describes this product as Body Creme. The item I was shipped was Body Lotion. This is an item I could have purchased directly from Thymes in the past.  I contacted House Resort who fulfilled my order.  When I asked why the Amazon ad, picture, and my invoice all say that I ordered Thymes Body Creme and I was shipped Body Lotion their response was that Amazon uses the USB code interchangeably for the body creme and body lotion.  I was sent the body lotion and was not very happy to get a different product than I ordered.  At $22 a bottle this was an expensive lesson to learn.  I think from now on I will check to see who the supplier really is and order through their website rather than Amazon.com. Perhaps I can be assured I will get what I ordered next time.</li>
            <li> I love rose scent but I am cautious about it because it can be a little old lady-ish. This one is a completely contemporary take on rose. It blends other scents in to give it a very different feel. I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Love Thymes products.</li>
            <li> This just smells so great - I&#x27;m not going to use it every day but great after a bath or if you just want to smell special - delic!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this body creme and I use it with the kimono rose perfume! always getting compliments every time i put it on because it smells natural and feminine !</li>
            <li> What an elegant scent.  I just love it!  It&#x27;s not too fruity, and not too rosey.  Just the right combo!</li>
            <li> I had been given a bottle of this lotion and the same scent in a body wash a year or so ago and never used them.  It was only when I decided to pass on the body wash to my daughter, that I got a true whiff of the scent of the Kimono Rose.  I tried the lotion and felt like kicking myself for not using it earlier.  It has such a clean, delicate floral scent, and is not greasy to the touch.  I use it often and especially when I want to layer the scent.  It is so pleasant.  I have given several away as gifts and never had anyone complain!</li>
            <li> my favorite lotion, on a daily basis.  Goes on with no greasy after-feel.  Thymes makes alot of very nice smelling lotions.  I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> Nice scent love to pair it along with Kimono Rose cologne so the scent last longer. Want to try the scented candle.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, always refill when I run out, and this was a great price.  Nice light scent, people always comment on how great I smell when I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents in body wash and lotion.</li>
            <li> I love the delicate scent.  It is not overpowering and makes my skin feel so soft.  I was flying out of the state and my bottle was confiscated by the airport security.  I order a new bottle instantly and I did not like waiting for it.  I am in love with this lotion.</li>
            <li> Lovely scent; hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it.  All the great scents disappear after a few years . . .  New is not necessarily better.</li>
            <li> Had purchased this in past - really nice smell.</li>
            <li> My daughter-in-law first introduced me to the product years ago, and I&#x27;m sold on it completely.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff!  soft, unique, feminine scent.  perfect for day or evening when you just want a hint of fragrance.</li>
            <li> Creamy and smells great!</li>
            <li> Great product.  The scent is wonderful and received good feedback from people.</li>
            <li> The overpowering fragrance to me was alcohol not roses.  My husband thought I smelled soapy - not the vib I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;This product will be going back!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful. Last long. IS a nice aroma.&lt;br /&gt; Very subtle. 100% RECOMMENDED.&lt;br /&gt;Your skin is smoother and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Love the lotion! It arrived safely and promptlyðŸ˜ƒ</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a nice rose smell, this lotion is NOT it. I don&#x27;t smell a rose scent at all.</li>
            <li> I love this body creme.  It has a scent that lasts with me for a long time.  Unlike cologne&#x27;s that i have tried, this product has a lasting scent.</li>
