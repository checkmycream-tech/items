            <li>but it ended up better than i thought.</li>
            <li>Plus its hilarious to see what they do to their face as they learn</li>
            <li>The relatively low-price paid, and the quality of the product received combine to make this an excellent value!</li>

            <li>This is a perfect gift for someone who is just starting to get into putting on makeup.</li>
            <li>Many choices to pick from.</li>

            <li>The colors are pretty and surprisingly opaque.</li>
            <li>up!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth the price and ideal for young girls to experiment with this kind of makeup kit.</li>

            <li>so I feel pretty good about this purchase and the price was just right.</li>

            <li>the best.&lt;br /&gt;I think this product will work great on darker tone skin also, especially the purples and greens.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall I am happy.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t so happy that one of the bigger powders crumbled in the mail, but that&#x27;s just shipping.</li>

            <li>Really nice, and shipped fast</li>
            <li>That being said, it was good for the 14 year old girl I bought it for.  </li>
            <li>The product seems good, ( well for a 12 yr old girl anyway)</li>
            <li>I love the different colors and they are in good condition.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>I love all the colors, some bright, some more toned down.</li>
            <li>The makeup didn&#x27;t come off quick or easily</li>
            <li>but it actually is a perfect size for everyday use and for travel!</li>
            <li>Cute at first</li>
            <li>She was so excited when she opened it</li>
            <li>she liked it very much as it was very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The blushes are also really good, my two fave are the ones in the top left, and bottom right side because they have some sparkles to them.</li>
            <li>I really liked this makeup kit, and was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>Most, or all, are shimmery which I really like.</li>
            <li>She really loves it , so many eye colors.</li>
            <li>she loved the last one I bought her from Shany...</li>
            <li>i really love the colors and the brightness of the colors was a little surprising.</li>
            <li>I chose this makeup kit due to the fact the colors were more natural than most and it was a good starter kit.  </li>
            <li>Now she is only 11, so she won&#x27;t be wearing the red lipstick, but she will use the softer color eye shadows and the foundation was a perfect match.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quick.</li>
            <li>The colors are bold and go on well.  </li>
            <li>and we really like the colors and variety, very nice, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>The colors were very pretty, and the make up goes on well, and stays on.</li>
            <li>This makeup kit was just something I bought to try out some cute new things</li>
            <li>makeup all around the casing came to me with many stripes defects had not seemed to be a new article.</li>
            <li>exactly as shown in the picture!</li>
            <li>i was a little nervous that the makeup wouldn&#x27;t be that great</li>
            <li>This is a great little makeup set.  </li>
            <li>A great gift for my little grandaughter.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>The size was smaller than I expected, but it still works great!</li>
            <li>But she has fun when I allow her to use.</li>
            <li>loved this product so much that she gave her mom several &amp;#34;make overs&amp;#34; with the make</li>
            <li>Fun for dressup and playtime, which is what I used it for.</li>
            <li>Worth the price</li>
            <li>even we seniors as well as jrs will have fun</li>
            <li>I love the way it goes on my eyes, some colors require several coats for best color, I use a eye base now and it goes on great.</li>
            <li>chosed this rating cuz its the right thing i ordered and my daughter loves it.</li>
            <li>But my wife is right</li>
            <li>They had so much fun with the different colors, it was just the right amount of make up to be fun, but not over the top.</li>
            <li>AND you only need a little bit and it turns out perfect!</li>
            <li>thank you for such a great gift for a teenage girl</li>
            <li>The colors are very light when applied, they don&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li>She is very much into anything girlie.  </li>
            <li>She likes it very much.</li>
            <li>My Wife Likes this product very much and as soon as she received the item she opened it</li>
            <li>Purchased for my 12 year old grandaughter based on other helpful reviews as being a great gift for girls learning to use makeup.</li>
            <li>The reviews of this make up were good, and I even went off Amazon&#x27;s site to read a little.</li>
            <li>I got this kit for her first beginner kit.</li>
            <li>Might be okay for a child&#x27;s cheek.&lt;br /&gt;It was packaged in just the original case and sent with my other orders, so</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Shany Cosmetics its the only line of makeup that I&#x27;ll use!</li>
            <li>It was her first make up kit</li>
            <li>Very versatile!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty makeup kit.</li>
            <li>when i first saw the price</li>
            <li>This item was bought for my teenage daughter for Christmas and she will love the variety the item has.</li>
            <li>so I could see how maybe a teenager would be able to use this make up regularly.  </li>
            <li>Very compact too!</li>
            <li>First I applied Smashbox photo finish eye lid primer on my lid first.</li>
            <li>I will try to apply differently on Day 2 to see if the pigment is more visible.</li>
            <li>Her eye lids and under eye area were very red for more than day after one application.  </li>
            <li>Because when I first buy it , it already broke.</li>
            <li>will order more at a later time</li>
            <li>but this was my first make up palette</li>
            <li>I bought this as a Christmas gift for my mother and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>It has a great variety of colors and is small enough that it is easy to carry with you.  </li>
            <li>Its cute and little but full of fun colors.</li>
            <li>My little girl has had a blast with this makeup, I really don&#x27;t know if it is considered good quality or not.</li>
            <li>It is my first purchase and I can say that I like this item because the colors are very pigmented</li>
            <li>High quality on a low price!!!Who can beat that??FIVE STARS:)</li>
            <li>For the price it makes for a lot of fun and has a lot for you to try new things.</li>
            <li>Easy to store and open.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and they last for quite some time.</li>
            <li>My wife liked very much, because have several types of products and several colors.</li>
            <li>Like getting a new paint set!!  </li>
            <li>I have been using this everyday, so many choices!  </li>
            <li>She says that the colors are very long lasting and of good quality.</li>
            <li>I bought this kit for my teenage daughter and she was excited to have so many fun color choices and was disappointed they didn&#x27;t look as bold and bright once they were applied</li>
            <li>Works nicely, is very portable, and can fit into a larger purse.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works nicely, is very portable, and can fit into a larger purse.&lt;br</li>
            <li>She just started wearing make-up for real.</li>
            <li>My daughter is really into watching make up application tutorials on you tube.</li>
            <li>The blushes are very pigmented.</li>
            <li>I have purchased it as a gift for myself haha...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend any of there products!</li>
            <li>The makeup kit is very convenient.</li>
            <li>but I would have expected a bit more.</li>
            <li>Our daughter has just hit the makeup age and as much as I didn&#x27;t want to allow her to use this stuff, I had to buy her it.</li>
            <li>but i did swatch them on my cheeks and they are very pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We got this for our daughter for Christmas, and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>She loves to sit at her vanity and pretend with real make-up.  </li>
            <li>The whole set.</li>
            <li>Met my expectations thanks purchase.</li>
            <li>Got here really fast, can&#x27;t wait to see the look on her face on Christmas.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadows and lip gloss works very well.</li>
            <li>This product is okay however most of the makeup was broken in the package.</li>
            <li>For a pre-teen, it is fine, but for someone older, it&#x27;s a little cheap looking.</li>
            <li>And needless to say, ​she loved it!</li>
            <li>Get this and a set of Shany brushes for the young woman in your life who is experimenting with make-up for the first time.</li>
            <li>arrived a day early and matches description exactly</li>
            <li>no pigmentation hot garbage, you live and learn I am new to buying makeup on line.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast (within a week), and was brand new in the wrapping.</li>
            <li>i would recommend this product to anyone that wants a wide variety of choices for cheap.</li>
            <li>It was a little small but perfect for a young girl who loves to experiment.</li>
            <li>I like the different colors in this kit, they are really very pretty.</li>
            <li>High Recommended , don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase them , you&#x27;ll be not disappoint .</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t stay on long but wipes clean.</li>
            <li>Could have been made a little better</li>
            <li>Little girls will love it.</li>
            <li>Bought this for play for my granddaughter, she and her neighbor love this but at 6 yrs they do need a little supervision.</li>
            <li>Gave them hours of fun, doing their makeup and practicing for the future.  </li>
            <li>My daughter loves her new make-up kit.</li>
            <li>You can see the colors, they looked very natural.</li>
            <li>Just right for a young teen.</li>
            <li>It is pretty basic for teens that what to use makeup.  </li>
            <li>I applied a light purple (#6 row #3) and applied a dark copper on my outer lid.</li>
            <li>First i tried using the little eye shadow sponge applicator, didn&#x27;t really like the way it applied, couldn&#x27;t really see the pigment.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t bad for a young person to learn to do there on makeup , very good price too,</li>
            <li>Over all I like the kit for the price but will be purchasing&amp;#34;better&amp;#34; make up in the near future, to acheive the look I really want.</li>
            <li>power tray kept sticking an not opening, an than broke off completely.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 11 year old niece for Christmas.</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t beat the price for someone who is just starting to experiment with make up.</li>
            <li>I just got my order, and overall I really like it.</li>
            <li>bought for my young granddaughter.</li>
            <li>Gift for my 13 yr old.</li>
            <li>I got this for my 8 year old daughter</li>
            <li>I purchased this for a Christmas Tree Angel gift for a 12 year old girl in a home for abused women and children.  </li>
            <li>8 year old Grandaughter got this for Christmas</li>
            <li>My 18yr old said that she will be surprised if she uses even 1/4 of the colors.</li>
            <li>Bought this for an 11 year old for Christmas.</li>
            <li>Play make up for my 6 year old and for my twin 13 year</li>
            <li>and she found that the item is exactly the way she expected.</li>
            <li>but since I&#x27;m on a new journey to start using make up on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>they&#x27;re only for a 12 year old</li>
            <li>but overall, this is by far</li>
            <li>I bought this as a christmas gift for my niece, she isn&#x27;t old enough to wear make up to school or anywere else</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t really what I expected</li>
            <li>However, I was expecting something that resembled less of a pre-teen first time make-up kit.</li>
            <li>But the eye shadows are hard to get the true color out.</li>
            <li>My granddaughter is 8 years old but likes dabbling with makeup with her older sister, and I didn&#x27;t want any goth type makeup or harsh eye colors.  </li>
            <li>up very well, some of the beige colors looked a little too shimmery</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love the Makeup Kit.&lt;br /&gt;SHANY</li>
            <li> At the top of her Christmas &amp;#34;Santa&amp;#34; list was a make-up kit.  </li>
            <li> but it ended up better than i thought.</li>
            <li> Plus its hilarious to see what they do to their face as they learn</li>
            <li> The relatively low-price paid, and the quality of the product received combine to make this an excellent value!</li>
            <li> I got to play with her and was really impressed with the pigment in all the different eyeshadows.  </li>
            <li> This is a perfect gift for someone who is just starting to get into putting on makeup.</li>
            <li> Many choices to pick from.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the application payoff and results.</li>
            <li> I would like to see more than 2 brushes included in the kit</li>
            <li> I love the color pallet .has</li>
            <li> It just came and it is outstanding.</li>
            <li> The colors were a bit darker than I thought, but she is enjoying it.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows are just stunning.</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t think this would be nice at first</li>
            <li> so I feel pretty good about this purchase and the price was just right.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used this eyeshadow palette just yet, but it sure is pretty!  </li>
            <li> Perfect kit for my little ballerina.</li>
            <li> just wanted something fresh and new,and i love it.</li>
            <li> the best.&lt;br /&gt;I think this product will work great on darker tone skin also, especially the purples and greens.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall I am happy.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t so happy that one of the bigger powders crumbled in the mail, but that&#x27;s just shipping.</li>

            <li> Overall, this was a great product for the price.</li>
            <li> Really nice, and shipped fast</li>
            <li> That being said, it was good for the 14 year old girl I bought it for.  </li>
            <li> The product seems good, ( well for a 12 yr old girl anyway)</li>
            <li> I love the different colors and they are in good condition.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> I love all the colors, some bright, some more toned down.</li>
            <li> The makeup didn&#x27;t come off quick or easily</li>
            <li> but it actually is a perfect size for everyday use and for travel!</li>
            <li> Cute at first</li>
            <li> She was so excited when she opened it</li>
            <li> she liked it very much as it was very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The blushes are also really good, my two fave are the ones in the top left, and bottom right side because they have some sparkles to them.</li>
            <li> I really liked this makeup kit, and was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> Most, or all, are shimmery which I really like.</li>
            <li> She really loves it , so many eye colors.</li>
            <li> she loved the last one I bought her from Shany...</li>
            <li> i really love the colors and the brightness of the colors was a little surprising.</li>
            <li> I chose this makeup kit due to the fact the colors were more natural than most and it was a good starter kit.  </li>
            <li> Now she is only 11, so she won&#x27;t be wearing the red lipstick, but she will use the softer color eye shadows and the foundation was a perfect match.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quick.</li>
            <li> The colors are bold and go on well.  </li>
            <li> and we really like the colors and variety, very nice, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> The colors were very pretty, and the make up goes on well, and stays on.</li>
            <li> This makeup kit was just something I bought to try out some cute new things</li>
            <li> makeup all around the casing came to me with many stripes defects had not seemed to be a new article.</li>
            <li> exactly as shown in the picture!</li>
            <li> i was a little nervous that the makeup wouldn&#x27;t be that great</li>
            <li> This is a great little makeup set.  </li>
            <li> A great gift for my little grandaughter.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> The size was smaller than I expected, but it still works great!</li>
            <li> But she has fun when I allow her to use.</li>
            <li> loved this product so much that she gave her mom several &amp;#34;make overs&amp;#34; with the make</li>
            <li> Fun for dressup and playtime, which is what I used it for.</li>
            <li> Worth the price</li>
            <li> even we seniors as well as jrs will have fun</li>
            <li> I love the way it goes on my eyes, some colors require several coats for best color, I use a eye base now and it goes on great.</li>
            <li> chosed this rating cuz its the right thing i ordered and my daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> But my wife is right</li>
            <li> They had so much fun with the different colors, it was just the right amount of make up to be fun, but not over the top.</li>
            <li> AND you only need a little bit and it turns out perfect!</li>
            <li> thank you for such a great gift for a teenage girl</li>
            <li> The colors are very light when applied, they don&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> She is very much into anything girlie.  </li>
            <li> She likes it very much.</li>
            <li> My Wife Likes this product very much and as soon as she received the item she opened it</li>
            <li> Purchased for my 12 year old grandaughter based on other helpful reviews as being a great gift for girls learning to use makeup.</li>
            <li> The reviews of this make up were good, and I even went off Amazon&#x27;s site to read a little.</li>
            <li> I got this kit for her first beginner kit.</li>
            <li> Might be okay for a child&#x27;s cheek.&lt;br /&gt;It was packaged in just the original case and sent with my other orders, so</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Shany Cosmetics its the only line of makeup that I&#x27;ll use!</li>
            <li> It was her first make up kit</li>
            <li> Very versatile!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty makeup kit.</li>
            <li> when i first saw the price</li>
            <li> This item was bought for my teenage daughter for Christmas and she will love the variety the item has.</li>
            <li> so I could see how maybe a teenager would be able to use this make up regularly.  </li>
            <li> Very compact too!</li>
            <li> First I applied Smashbox photo finish eye lid primer on my lid first.</li>
            <li> I will try to apply differently on Day 2 to see if the pigment is more visible.</li>
            <li> Her eye lids and under eye area were very red for more than day after one application.  </li>
            <li> Because when I first buy it , it already broke.</li>
            <li> will order more at a later time</li>
            <li> but this was my first make up palette</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my mother and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> It has a great variety of colors and is small enough that it is easy to carry with you.  </li>
            <li> Its cute and little but full of fun colors.</li>
            <li> My little girl has had a blast with this makeup, I really don&#x27;t know if it is considered good quality or not.</li>
            <li> It is my first purchase and I can say that I like this item because the colors are very pigmented</li>
            <li> High quality on a low price!!!Who can beat that??FIVE STARS:)</li>
            <li> For the price it makes for a lot of fun and has a lot for you to try new things.</li>
            <li> Easy to store and open.</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and they last for quite some time.</li>
            <li> My wife liked very much, because have several types of products and several colors.</li>
            <li> Like getting a new paint set!!  </li>
            <li> I have been using this everyday, so many choices!  </li>
            <li> She says that the colors are very long lasting and of good quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit for my teenage daughter and she was excited to have so many fun color choices and was disappointed they didn&#x27;t look as bold and bright once they were applied</li>
            <li> Works nicely, is very portable, and can fit into a larger purse.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works nicely, is very portable, and can fit into a larger purse.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She just started wearing make-up for real.</li>
            <li> My daughter is really into watching make up application tutorials on you tube.</li>
            <li> The blushes are very pigmented.</li>
            <li> I have purchased it as a gift for myself haha...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend any of there products!</li>
            <li> The makeup kit is very convenient.</li>
            <li> but I would have expected a bit more.</li>
            <li> Our daughter has just hit the makeup age and as much as I didn&#x27;t want to allow her to use this stuff, I had to buy her it.</li>
            <li> but i did swatch them on my cheeks and they are very pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We got this for our daughter for Christmas, and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> She loves to sit at her vanity and pretend with real make-up.  </li>
            <li> The whole set.</li>
            <li> Met my expectations thanks purchase.</li>
            <li> Got here really fast, can&#x27;t wait to see the look on her face on Christmas.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows and lip gloss works very well.</li>
            <li> This product is okay however most of the makeup was broken in the package.</li>
            <li> For a pre-teen, it is fine, but for someone older, it&#x27;s a little cheap looking.</li>
            <li> And needless to say, ​she loved it!</li>
            <li> Get this and a set of Shany brushes for the young woman in your life who is experimenting with make-up for the first time.</li>
            <li> arrived a day early and matches description exactly</li>
            <li> no pigmentation hot garbage, you live and learn I am new to buying makeup on line.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast (within a week), and was brand new in the wrapping.</li>
            <li> i would recommend this product to anyone that wants a wide variety of choices for cheap.</li>
            <li> It was a little small but perfect for a young girl who loves to experiment.</li>
            <li> I like the different colors in this kit, they are really very pretty.</li>
            <li> High Recommended , don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase them , you&#x27;ll be not disappoint .</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on long but wipes clean.</li>
            <li> Could have been made a little better</li>
            <li> Little girls will love it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for play for my granddaughter, she and her neighbor love this but at 6 yrs they do need a little supervision.</li>
            <li> Gave them hours of fun, doing their makeup and practicing for the future.  </li>
            <li> My daughter loves her new make-up kit.</li>
            <li> You can see the colors, they looked very natural.</li>
            <li> Just right for a young teen.</li>
            <li> It is pretty basic for teens that what to use makeup.  </li>
            <li> I applied a light purple (#6 row #3) and applied a dark copper on my outer lid.</li>
            <li> First i tried using the little eye shadow sponge applicator, didn&#x27;t really like the way it applied, couldn&#x27;t really see the pigment.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t bad for a young person to learn to do there on makeup , very good price too,</li>
            <li> Over all I like the kit for the price but will be purchasing&amp;#34;better&amp;#34; make up in the near future, to acheive the look I really want.</li>
            <li> power tray kept sticking an not opening, an than broke off completely.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 11 year old niece for Christmas.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t beat the price for someone who is just starting to experiment with make up.</li>
            <li> I just got my order, and overall I really like it.</li>
            <li> bought for my young granddaughter.</li>
            <li> Gift for my 13 yr old.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 8 year old daughter</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a Christmas Tree Angel gift for a 12 year old girl in a home for abused women and children.  </li>
            <li> 8 year old Grandaughter got this for Christmas</li>
            <li> My 18yr old said that she will be surprised if she uses even 1/4 of the colors.</li>
            <li> Bought this for an 11 year old for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Play make up for my 6 year old and for my twin 13 year</li>
            <li> and she found that the item is exactly the way she expected.</li>
            <li> but since I&#x27;m on a new journey to start using make up on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> they&#x27;re only for a 12 year old</li>
            <li> but overall, this is by far</li>
            <li> I bought this as a christmas gift for my niece, she isn&#x27;t old enough to wear make up to school or anywere else</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t really what I expected</li>
            <li> However, I was expecting something that resembled less of a pre-teen first time make-up kit.</li>
            <li> But the eye shadows are hard to get the true color out.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter is 8 years old but likes dabbling with makeup with her older sister, and I didn&#x27;t want any goth type makeup or harsh eye colors.  </li>
            <li> up very well, some of the beige colors looked a little too shimmery</li>
            <li> one, only one (which is okay) of the eye shadows was a little broken.</li>
            <li> Box is difficult to open, bottom drawer comes off alignment to easily.</li>
            <li> When u open the box its look not new .</li>
            <li> The only thing with this item is the different compartments were a little hard to open, although it was fine after I wiggled them a little.</li>
            <li> Kit is small but lots of vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> its also bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> This is a much smaller product then I had expected it to be for the price.  </li>
            <li> Item as described, item received earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my sister who has been begging me for makeup for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> As far as i know no pieces were missing.</li>
            <li> but then the bottom drawer continued to get stuck and it became far too messy.</li>
            <li> The array of colors in this kit are very vibrate but fail to live up to their pigment when applied to the skin.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it a four stars is because  I couldn&#x27;t do a four and a half, and the lip stuff obviously and also</li>
            <li> When you try to take out is not easy and in general is too fragile the case</li>
            <li> the eyeshadows were all over the place everything was a big blob and a big mess ....</li>
            <li> This is a nice set but some of them were broken when I got it but other than them getting broken</li>
            <li> For some odd reason, the post office decided it had to ship the package all the way across MO and back before it make it to me in Springfield.</li>
            <li> Product wears as long as any other.</li>
            <li> A wide spectrum of colors, and</li>
            <li> She loves the selection of the wide array of colors.</li>
            <li> I like the wide variety of colors</li>
            <li> Wide variety of makeup.  </li>
            <li> disappointed as the brushes are very cheap and when using them, I end up with hairs from the brushes on my face.  </li>
            <li> The other kit says Shany Cosmetics on it..</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it was just her or a bigger issue with the quality of the product but purchase with caution.</li>
            <li> I got it for my daughters makeover birthday party and its tinier than I expected but has lots of colors!</li>
            <li> Then with a brush I applied the shimmery dark copper (#5 on row #6) on my lid, the lighter dark brown (#4  row #6) on my outer lid and the pink pearly highlight (#1  row #1) on my tear duct.</li>
            <li> The blush brush is far to small and the lip gloss brush is very stiff.</li>
            <li> hard to open.  </li>
            <li> The greens and blues take some work in removing, but that is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> Granddaughter will love me, mama will hate me.</li>
            <li> we gave it as a gift for a 10 yr old, but once it was opened you saw all the powder was broken</li>
            <li> The product is ok, I wish this compact had a mirror and the base was not easy to pull out so one has to be careful.  </li>
            <li> The black ( #8 row 6) across my lid as a smokey eye liner.</li>
            <li> but a little difficult to open the different compartments.  </li>
            <li> but my wife said the lipstick was to dark and heavy.</li>
            <li> then some of the costume make up she had worn when she was little.</li>
            <li> It has everything you need in just one little case.  </li>
            <li> So the little girls were in heaven with this set.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Product came with one of the make ups broken so this made the rating low.</li>
            <li> My packaged arrived on time and in tact even though it wasn&#x27;t packed tight!</li>
            <li> The brushes are not very nice, but I already have some that I use.</li>
            <li> She has never reacted to make-up in the past.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t know it was that small</li>
            <li> Has brushes and small drawer in the bottom for blush and lips.  </li>
            <li> Quality of the case was not very good.  </li>
            <li> It was hard to find a kit that doesn&#x27;t include eye liner and mascara</li>
            <li> they looked dull and muddy.</li>
            <li> My wife told me the case is not good.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the size, I though it would be bigger.</li>
            <li> The blush brush is lame to whereas you are going to take forever trying to apply even amounts on your face.</li>
            <li> but I got the wrong brand</li>
            <li> Nothing was broken or out of place!</li>
            <li> AS EXPENSIVE MAKE-UP.THANK</li>
            <li> My disappointment is with the case.</li>
            <li> on the bad part of things it just didnt stay together</li>
            <li> We disappointed with this kit.</li>
            <li> we were very disappointed when it arrived and the powders were shattered and everywhere.  </li>

            <li> Perfect gift for a girly girl learning to shine. The colors are pretty and surprisingly opaque. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> my daughter received this a gift and we really like the colors and variety, very nice, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> i got this for my 12th birthday and it is awesome! exactly as shown in the picture! AND you only need a little bit and it turns out perfect! i didnt realize that it didnt come with something to put your blush on with but its ok :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 11 year old niece for Christmas. She just started wearing make-up for real. I wanted her to have something that way better quality then some of the costume make up she had worn when she was little. The reviews of this make up were good, and I even went off Amazon&#x27;s site to read a little. The colors were very pretty, and the make up goes on well, and stays on. Now she is only 11, so she won&#x27;t be wearing the red lipstick, but she will use the softer color eye shadows and the foundation was a perfect match. You really can&#x27;t beat the price for someone who is just starting to experiment with make up. It comes in a cute box so she can just close it and put it in the drawer when she is finished.</li>
            <li> Awesome delivery, Highly recommend !</li>
            <li> I love this kit, amazing!</li>
            <li> The Shany makeup kit is perfect for young girls looking to explore and to learn techniques in applying and shading makeup.</li>
            <li> loved the kit. I ordered it for my daughters 12th birthday. She&#x27;ll love it but my only concern is that it is advertised as a Shany product...which it was not. Unless Shany changed their name to Beauty Revolution. I also ordered another Shany make up kit for her at the same time I ordered this one. The other kit says Shany Cosmetics on it..this one does not. Either way....they&#x27;re only for a 12 year old so no big deal I guess.</li>
            <li> This makeup kit was just something I bought to try out some cute new things and I love it. For the price it makes for a lot of fun and has a lot for you to try new things. Its cute and little but full of fun colors. I love it. Use it everyday.</li>
            <li> My daughter is really into watching make up application tutorials on you tube. I got her this set as a gift and she loves it. It has so many of the colors she needs to follow the tutorials.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift for my sister in law. And needless to say, ​she loved it! she loves the quality and the bright colors!</li>
            <li> Very nice gift for pre-teen to practice putting on makeup!  Lots of colors to choose from.</li>
            <li> Granddaughter will love me, mama will hate me. I guess I will see lots of pics with all this stuff on!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first.  However, when I received it.  I was very happy with this product.  It has very nice colors and very nice design case for affordable price.  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I like the different colors in this kit, they are really very pretty. The lip gloss actually stains your lips. I won&#x27;t be using those... I agree, the brushes kinda suck. The blush brush is lame to whereas you are going to take forever trying to apply even amounts on your face. The bristles come out easily. Might be okay for a child&#x27;s cheek.&lt;br /&gt;It was packaged in just the original case and sent with my other orders, so I couldn&#x27;t say for sure on how they would pack this really good if it&#x27;s by itself.</li>
            <li> We bought 2 of this set for our girls in Christmas. They love it! It is pretty basic for teens that what to use makeup.  It was hard to find a kit that doesn&#x27;t include eye liner and mascara (I don&#x27;t want my girls to use it yet).&lt;br /&gt;pretty colours easy to use.</li>
            <li> Bought for my niece. These things use to cost 25 cents from a gumball machine.  Looks like a good product.</li>
            <li> The Glamour Girl Makeup kit was Beautiful.Has many colors and was delivered without any breaks in the shadow powders and has a great case for viewing.I love it!</li>
            <li> I like the pallet allot. But the eye shadows are hard to get the true color out. The blushes are very pigmented. Over all I I love this pallet and will get some more of this brand soon.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves the colors, and the makeup. I know nothing about the quality, or anything else, I was simply looking for something as a gift for my wife, and she uses this every day now.</li>
            <li> i loved the product ,,very good nice looking n looks very stylish worth for the value,,, i will recommend it to all</li>
            <li> Nice packaging and I just love the colors. Will be trying these out on my clients and this summer I will be trying the bright colors with some of my summer looks.</li>
            <li> no pigmentation hot garbage, you live and learn I am new to buying makeup on line. Have found much better products.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for a friends daughter who is a teenager and is into beauty. I was hoping for a nice product without spending a fortune on a higher end line.  I found the packaging awesome and &amp;#34;trendy&amp;#34; as well as the packaging of quality. I have not used the makeup because it is a gift, however it looks nice, not &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; I would purchase this for myself as well as others and feel comfortable gifting as it is nicer than the cheaper make-ups.</li>
            <li> I just got my order, and overall I really like it. Basically the eye-shadows are great! Now i Haven&#x27;t tried them on yet, but they are really gorgeous looking.  Most, or all, are shimmery which I really like. The blushes are also really good, my two fave are the ones in the top left, and bottom right side because they have some sparkles to them. The lip gloss is, well not glossy but then I didn&#x27;t buy this because of them, they were just sort of included. I got it for the eyeshadow and I am really pleased. The only reason I gave it a four stars is because  I couldn&#x27;t do a four and a half, and the lip stuff obviously and also one, only one (which is okay) of the eye shadows was a little broken.</li>
            <li> This is a good product with a good price, I bought it as a gift to my friend, she likes it</li>
            <li> the product came in flawless condition.. its also bigger than I expected. LOVE the colors. They look even better than the picture. I recommend it to all eye shadow lovers on a budget.</li>
            <li> I have purchased it as a gift for myself haha...just wanted something fresh and new,and i love it.High quality on a low price!!!Who can beat that??FIVE STARS:)</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used this eyeshadow palette just yet, but it sure is pretty!  A wide spectrum of colors, and it arrived without any damage.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.  Will update if problems arise.</li>
            <li> The colors are very light when applied, they don&#x27;t last.  I bought this kit for my teenage daughter and she was excited to have so many fun color choices and was disappointed they didn&#x27;t look as bold and bright once they were applied they looked dull and muddy.</li>
            <li> I was item received on today . Very nice item and Exactly as like picture . I purchased from &amp;#34; BEAUTYezSHOP &amp;#34; Seller . High Recommended , don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase them , you&#x27;ll be not disappoint . Thanks a lot for Great product .</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Shany Cosmetics its the only line of makeup that I&#x27;ll use! They have wonderful colors that are bright  for a night out as well as sophisticated colors for the office! I highly recommend any of there products!</li>
            <li> We bought this for my daughter&#x27;s spa themed bday party. They had so much fun with the different colors, it was just the right amount of make up to be fun, but not over the top. My disappointment is with the case. The slide with the blush came out of the larger case and we could not get it back in. I was hoping this unit would last longer than a day.</li>
            <li> bought for my young granddaughter. She kept getting into her mother&#x27;s makeup. Granddaughter was very happy. Her mom was jealous because she now had more colors to choose from. It was a little small but perfect for a young girl who loves to experiment.</li>
            <li> I received this make up within 2 days of ordering it!  I have  Carmel color skin and some of the colors&lt;br /&gt;Showed up very well, some of the beige colors looked a little too shimmery but overall, this is by far the best.&lt;br /&gt;I think this product will work great on darker tone skin also, especially the purples and greens.&lt;br /&gt;The blush is lovely!</li>
            <li> The product is ok, I wish this compact had a mirror and the base was not easy to pull out so one has to be careful.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the size, I though it would be bigger. For a pre-teen, it is fine, but for someone older, it&#x27;s a little cheap looking.</li>
            <li> The makeup kit is very convenient. I love the choice of eye shades and that I have everything in one neat place.</li>
            <li> This is a much smaller product then I had expected it to be for the price.  That being said, it was good for the 14 year old girl I bought it for.  She will continue to get a lot of use out of but I would have expected a bit more.</li>
            <li> She really loves it , so many eye colors. Just right for a young teen. It arrived in perfect condition, and a very timely manner , thank you.</li>
            <li> When I got it the powder was crumbled and all over the box had to dump it out could not use</li>
            <li> Colors are nice, case is cheap already broke</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loved this item.  It was her first make up kit and it gave her a lot to select from as she learns what make up looks good on her.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these. My Wife and Daughter love the makeup. There are lots of colors nothing not to like.</li>
            <li> Brought this for my granddaughter and she loves it.  This kit had a variety of makeup and works well for her.</li>
            <li> She loves the selection of the wide array of colors. She says that the colors are very long lasting and of good quality.</li>
            <li> Did not have face powder in kit I received. We disappointed with this kit. Won&#x27;t. Order. This again.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Quality of the case was not very good.  The design of the case was o.k. but a little difficult to open the different compartments.  Could have been made a little better</li>
            <li> It is a very good product for the price. Lot of options for the price of the product. My wife liked it!</li>
            <li> Good cosmetic, it has a many color for using. I love the blush color and packaging of this cosmetic. thank</li>
            <li> Love the color selection in the eye shadows. Color lasts all day no fading.  Easy to store and open. Gift for my 13 yr old.</li>
            <li> This product is okay however most of the makeup was broken in the package. I would recommend it to others if mine came in proper order. My girlfriend was not that pleased.</li>
            <li> We got this product for my sisters-in law and they just loved it . The Shades are awesome and most important my sisters-in-law were very happy with this gift.Product arrived quick.Overall I am happy.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 8 year old daughter and she just loves it. It has everything you need in just one little case.  Very versatile!</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift and they loved it!</li>
            <li> Item as described, item received earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but I got the wrong brand and I can&#x27;t bother to take it back but my cousin got it and she loves it</li>
            <li> Good price and it seems to be a well constructed product.  It is a gift for someone,  and I will be happy to give it in the condition it&#x27;s in.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice makeup kit.  Many shades of eye shadows and includes blushes and powders.  My neice loved it.</li>
            <li> My packaged arrived on time and in tact even though it wasn&#x27;t packed tight! Nothing was broken or out of place! &amp;#34;However the bottom tray&amp;#34; I could not get back in the slot, after what seemed to be 100 attempts I gave up! But the colors are very vibrant and the extras brushes will come in handy! I&#x27;m planning on giving it to my niece cause she loved the last one I bought her from Shany... Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> chosed this rating cuz its the right thing i ordered and my daughter loves it. and will be buying more stuff</li>
            <li> My wife told me the case is not good. When you try to take out is not easy and in general is too fragile the case</li>
            <li> Im happy with the product. Thank you to Shany</li>
            <li> I love the Makeup Kit.&lt;br /&gt;SHANY Glamour Girl Makeup Kit - 48 Eyeshadow /...&lt;br /&gt;SHANY</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty makeup kit. I like the wide variety of colors and it&#x27;s convenient to carry anywhere I go.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a Christmas Tree Angel gift for a 12 year old girl in a home for abused women and children.  At the top of her Christmas &amp;#34;Santa&amp;#34; list was a make-up kit.  I also bought mood lipsticks to go with it.  I hope she liked them both!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my 12 year old grandaughter based on other helpful reviews as being a great gift for girls learning to use makeup.</li>
            <li> it is not the best makeup kit but it had awesome colors. on the bad part of things it just didnt stay together i say save you money</li>
            <li> A lot smaller than it looks in the pictures. But still it&#x27;s a good makeup set</li>
            <li> Perfect kit for my little ballerina.</li>
            <li> The product seems good, ( well for a 12 yr old girl anyway) I wasn&#x27;t so happy that one of the bigger powders crumbled in the mail, but that&#x27;s just shipping.</li>
            <li> Great make up. Kit is small but lots of vibrant colors. This was a gift for my daughter and she loves it</li>
            <li> Funny/bad smell ... I never use it because of the smell</li>
            <li> my grand daughter loved it.  She is very much into anything girlie.  So the little girls were in heaven with this set.</li>
            <li> for the price of this kit the make up is great. i really love the colors and the brightness of the colors was a little surprising. when i first saw the price i was a little nervous that the makeup wouldn&#x27;t be that great but it ended up better than i thought. i don&#x27;t regret buying this product and i would recommend this to anyone looking for lots of colors for a cheap price.</li>
            <li> They loved it. Gave them hours of fun, doing their makeup and practicing for the future.  I would truly recommend it for teens.</li>
            <li> Product came with one of the make ups broken so this made the rating low.</li>
            <li> Good, cheap makeup set with lots of colours. Little girls will love it.</li>
            <li> A lot of the makeup came brokn up and there was powder everywhere</li>
            <li> makeup I received one of the items corners, and with stained glass. makeup all around the casing came to me with many stripes defects had not seemed to be a new article.</li>
            <li> If u can&#x27;t do it with this it just can&#x27;t b done</li>
            <li> Our daughter has just hit the makeup age and as much as I didn&#x27;t want to allow her to use this stuff, I had to buy her it. I being Stepdad don&#x27;t always agree with things when it comes to our daughter. But my wife is right shes growing up and this makeup kit made her so happy. Plus its hilarious to see what they do to their face as they learn lol &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Lots of choices in kit. This item was bought for my teenage daughter for Christmas and she will love the variety the item has.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know jack about this product personally. Bought it as a gift and the person loved it. End of the story.</li>
            <li> 8 year old Grandaughter got this for Christmas she loves it for dress up.</li>
            <li> The relatively low-price paid, and the quality of the product received combine to make this an excellent value! I would indeed recommend this item...</li>
            <li> THE QUALITY OF THIS MAKE-UP WAS VERY GOOD,JUST AS GOOD AS EXPENSIVE MAKE-UP.THANK YOU.SHANY MAKE-UP IS VERY GOOD MAKE-UP.IT WENT ON SMOOTH AND LOOKS VERY GOOD ON.</li>
            <li> cheap plastic box.  hard to open.  items spilled out.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a christmas gift for my niece, she isn&#x27;t old enough to wear make up to school or anywere else yet but she loves to play dress up. The kit came with a really good array of colors.  I got to play with her and was really impressed with the pigment in all the different eyeshadows.  The makeup didn&#x27;t come off quick or easily so I could see how maybe a teenager would be able to use this make up regularly.  The price is excellent for the amount of product in the kit and the kit comes in a really nice case.  I don&#x27;t think I would wear theses colors but I can definitely see myself now purchasing a Shany palette with colors that would work for me.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my sister who has been begging me for makeup for as long as I can remember. The eyeshadows have a nice shimmer to them and the colors are really nice as well. The size was smaller than I expected, but it still works great!</li>
            <li> This is a great little makeup set.  It has a great variety of colors and is small enough that it is easy to carry with you.  I got it for my granddaughter for Christmas, but I just may buy myself one next time I&#x27;m in the market for makeup.  My only issue with SHANY is that they shipped it USPS and it came several days after it was promised.  For some odd reason, the post office decided it had to ship the package all the way across MO and back before it make it to me in Springfield.</li>
            <li> was a Christmas gift, they got it in a close time and it was undamaged. As far as i know no pieces were missing.</li>
            <li> Bought this for play for my granddaughter, she and her neighbor love this but at 6 yrs they do need a little supervision.</li>
            <li> This showed up in great condition. The colors are very bright and vibrant! I can&#x27;t wait to give this as a Christmas gift to my sister. Very compact too! I thought it would be a bit bigger but it actually is a perfect size for everyday use and for travel!</li>
            <li> Get this and a set of Shany brushes for the young woman in your life who is experimenting with make-up for the first time. I also threw in a lighted make-up mirror as a bundle gift and have given hours of entertainment to my daughter for about $50 total.&lt;br /&gt;What a great gift.</li>
            <li> This kit is really nice and the makeup is just gorgeous. It goes on really nice and is of good quality. The makeup stays on until you take it off and looks gorgeous!! I gave this kit as a gift to my Daughter and she loves it!!</li>
            <li> This is a perfect gift for someone who is just starting to get into putting on makeup. It was just enough.</li>
            <li> Bought for gift received a bit damaged but doable!</li>
            <li> i bought this for somebody . When u open the box its look not new . Quality of product like $ store. So in my opinion don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> Lo recomiendo es muy funsional, ademas que el precio me parece accesible para todas las bomdades que ofrece. los colores estan bellos.</li>
            <li> product was shipped in a timely fashion...i plan to gift it to my daughter for her marker  bday coming up</li>
            <li> Gave to my daughter. She likes it very much. Many choices to pick from. All was o.k. with the kit. Would purchase another one.</li>
            <li> Shany Palette Review&lt;br /&gt;Day 1: Used the brown row of colors. First I applied Smashbox photo finish eye lid primer on my lid first. Then with a brush I applied the shimmery dark copper (#5 on row #6) on my lid, the lighter dark brown (#4  row #6) on my outer lid and the pink pearly highlight (#1  row #1) on my tear duct. The black ( #8 row 6) across my lid as a smokey eye liner. You can see the colors, they looked very natural. I will try to apply differently on Day 2 to see if the pigment is more visible. This color application was close to my skin tone so they looked very warm and natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day2: used a different technique for application. First i tried using the little eye shadow sponge applicator, didn&#x27;t really like the way it applied, couldn&#x27;t really see the pigment. So instead of a brush i used my finger tip. Very good application. Again i used smash box eye primer. I applied a light purple (#6 row #3) and applied a dark copper on my outer lid. Though is a beautiful color. Nice color finish to it.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used to blushes on a finished look but i did swatch them on my cheeks and they are very pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to keep the palette. I&#x27;m satisfied with the application payoff and results.</li>
            <li> We got this for our daughter for Christmas, and she absolutely loves it.  The colors are bold and go on well.  The greens and blues take some work in removing, but that is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> Great variety of colors. Smooth application also. Was a gift for my daughter while she plays dress up but i tried it also.</li>
            <li> My Wife Likes this product very much and as soon as she received the item she opened it and she found that the item is exactly the way she expected. she liked it very much as it was very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I like it because of the variety and everything is in one package.  I ordered one for my granddaughter and a gift and when I saw it, I ordered one for me.  Can&#x27;t beat the price and quality of the item.</li>
            <li> The array of colors in this kit are very vibrate but fail to live up to their pigment when applied to the skin. The blush brush is far to small and the lip gloss brush is very stiff. Over all I like the kit for the price but will be purchasing&amp;#34;better&amp;#34; make up in the near future, to acheive the look I really want.</li>
            <li> This is NOT shany brand. This is some off-brand called &amp;#34;BR&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging isnt the same color either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy, especially if you are looking for SHANY products (because its not at all!!)</li>
            <li> The person who received this as a gift was very excited! The quality is good and she has so much to choose from in this set. I would purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> My daughter had a severe allergic reaction to this product.  Her eye lids and under eye area were very red for more than day after one application.  She has never reacted to make-up in the past.  Not sure if it was just her or a bigger issue with the quality of the product but purchase with caution.</li>
            <li> A great gift for my little grandaughter.  She loves to sit at her vanity and pretend with real make-up.  Quick delivery and a great price.  Great seller.  Thank you.  A++</li>
            <li> when I opend the bag.... the eyeshadows were all over the place everything was a big blob and a big mess ....</li>
            <li> bought this as a gift and it was just what the description said....great product and great value....thank you for such a great gift for a teenage girl</li>
            <li> This kit is great!  I have used it to it&#x27;s end.  Great color choices let you play and experiment.  Love it!</li>
            <li> There are a lot of colors to choose from.  I would like to see more than 2 brushes included in the kit</li>
            <li> The container was awesome but my wife said the lipstick was to dark and heavy. It is convenient for travel.</li>
            <li> Because when I first buy it , it already broke. The whole set. So I don&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li> Has a nice variety of colors with use for a variety of evenings and events. Product wears as long as any other.</li>
            <li> arrived a day early and matches description exactly</li>
            <li> Made for a great gift for the birthday girl and get friends they dove right in</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas Present. I got it for my neice. She loved it. Im sure she has used it!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my tween as a play-makeup set. Cute at first but then the bottom drawer continued to get stuck and it became far too messy.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my daughter. Was not the brand in photo, was BR brand. Colors were also different.  Will never order again! Should have read all the reviews.</li>
            <li> We bought this for our daughter for Christmas. She has had a lot of fun trying out all the colors, have to admit some times I borrow it :)</li>
            <li> My little girl has had a blast with this makeup, I really don&#x27;t know if it is considered good quality or not. But she has fun when I allow her to use. The case it comes in is nice and sturdy. Lots of different colors to chose.</li>
            <li> Met my expectations thanks purchase.</li>
            <li> She was so excited when she opened it</li>
            <li> loved this product so much that she gave her mom several &amp;#34;make overs&amp;#34; with the make up!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth the price and ideal for young girls to experiment with this kind of makeup kit.</li>
            <li> Daughter loves makeup.  Hopefully she will get great use out of this product.  Box is difficult to open, bottom drawer comes off alignment to easily.</li>
            <li> Great product from what I see so far . Just got it in the mail today ! Can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
            <li> It is my first purchase and I can say that I like this item because the colors are very pigmented so I love shany cosmetics are of good quality and the price is excellent for this reason I am a customer fully sastified with this tem ..</li>
            <li> I love the color pallet .has lots of vibrant pigments wish it came with more foundation shades but still a very good product</li>
            <li> we were very disappointed when it arrived and the powders were shattered and everywhere.  its a great kit.  we gave it as a gift for a 10 yr old, but once it was opened you saw all the powder was broken</li>
            <li> I bought this makeup set for my daughter and she liked a lot. I&#x27;m so happy with her satisfaction!  Thanks shany cosmetics by your products being so good!</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift.  Makeup is just as shown.  Wide variety of makeup.  Good colors.  I would recommend this for a teenage girl just starting with makeup.</li>
            <li> This makeup kit is so perfect for me and I am so happy to use it everyday. I love the different colors and they are in good condition. The package was delivered on time and in good condition. I never regret buying this item because they sent me the one that I like.</li>
            <li> I love all the colors, some bright, some more toned down. I have been using this everyday, so many choices!  Even my Mom has been using it!  The brushes are not very nice, but I already have some that I use.</li>
            <li> arrived in good shape!  love the colors! and brushes! to go along with it! will order more at a later time</li>
            <li> I know that for the price I paid, I shouldn&#x27;t be expecting Estee Lauder. However, I was expecting something that resembled less of a pre-teen first time make-up kit. My 18yr old said that she will be surprised if she uses even 1/4 of the colors. They are VERY bright.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t really what I expected didn&#x27;t know it was that small but this was my first make up palette so it was a steal</li>
            <li> gave it as a gift and she loved it!!</li>
            <li> Like getting a new paint set!!  Neat colors.</li>
            <li> Fun for dressup and playtime, which is what I used it for.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my granddaughter for Christmas.  I chose this makeup kit due to the fact the colors were more natural than most and it was a good starter kit.  My granddaughter is 8 years old but likes dabbling with makeup with her older sister, and I didn&#x27;t want any goth type makeup or harsh eye colors.  This turned out perfectly.  She really liked this grown up gift.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my mother and she absolutely loves it! I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Bought this for an 11 year old for Christmas. It just came and it is outstanding. Not for the grown up. It has lots of wild colors but perfect for what we wanted. Worth the price</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift to my daughter and she was thrilled with all the color choices.  Very good price and pleased with the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves her new make-up kit. It is the perfect starter set. The colors were a bit darker than I thought, but she is enjoying it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think this would be nice at first but once it arrived in the mail I opened it and the colors are great.  I don&#x27;t know how to use eye shadow or any kind of make up for that matter but since I&#x27;m on a new journey to start using make up on a regular basis.  I figured this would be perfect because there are a ton of colors to choose from and blushes so I feel pretty good about this purchase and the price was just right.</li>
            <li> Works nicely, is very portable, and can fit into a larger purse.&lt;br /&gt;It includes all the things I need to &amp;#34;put on my face&amp;#34; while on a trip or in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it works nicely, and the makeup goes on nicely. Nice selection of colors too</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows are just stunning. I&#x27;m considering buying another one</li>

            <li> I am more than happy with all of the products that I have received from shany makeup kit is no exception everything came in perfect condition the colors are beautiful I think many people can wear these colors they are Med in colors even we seniors as well as jrs will have fun</li>
            <li> Love this makeup kit. It fits in my purse and has everything I need. The only problem is, there&#x27;s no mirror while you put on your eyeshadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the colors, the blushes and lip glosses compliment my skin tone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great gift for yourself and for your friends!</li>
            <li> The item arrived here early and was in very good condition, it appeared good as new. The only thing with this item is the different compartments were a little hard to open, although it was fine after I wiggled them a little. You can also take out all each eye shadow and move them if you wanted them.</li>
            <li> I received this in a timely manner. My grand daughter loves it. It isn&#x27;t bad for a young person to learn to do there on makeup , very good price too,</li>
            <li> Got here really fast, can&#x27;t wait to see the look on her face on Christmas. I need five more words. lol</li>
            <li> My wife liked very much, because have several types of products and several colors. She was very happy when received this gift</li>
            <li> Play make up for my 6 year old and for my twin 13 year Ole&#x27;s. Doesn&#x27;t stay on long but wipes clean. Perfect for the intended use.</li>
            <li> I got it for my daughters makeover birthday party and its tinier than I expected but has lots of colors!</li>
            <li> disappointed as the brushes are very cheap and when using them, I end up with hairs from the brushes on my face.  Guess you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> Super Fast shipping, Item is as described, great transaction!! Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Has brushes and small drawer in the bottom for blush and lips.  I love the way it goes on my eyes, some colors require several coats for best color, I use a eye base now and it goes on great.</li>
            <li> The one I received was a BR brand, which I could have bought cheaper at the supermarket, it didn&#x27;t say SHANY anywhere.</li>
            <li> Great product, provides a lot of choices, the product wears great and lasts all day.  i would recommend this product to anyone that wants a wide variety of choices for cheap.</li>
            <li> THIS KIT IS GREAT FOR KIDS WHO LOVE TO DRESS UP. THERE IS A NICE ASSORTMENT OF BLUSHERS EYESHADOWS AND LIP GLOSSES TO CHOOSE FROM. iT ALSO COMES OFF EASILY.</li>
            <li> A great gift for someone getting into makeup.</li>
            <li> I really liked this makeup kit, and was pleasantly surprised! The shipping was fast (within a week), and was brand new in the wrapping. The eyeshadows and lip gloss works very well. I would recommend using an eyelid primer, as that helps the shadow colors to stay on longer. Overall, this was a great product for the price.</li>
            <li> The colors are great. They are easy to use and they last for quite some time. All in all nice value.</li>
            <li> Really nice, and shipped fast</li>
