            <li>I have baby fine flyaway hair that is easy to weigh down and this hairspray gives a good hold, controls the frizz, but yet isn&#x27;t stiff or sticky.  </li>

            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that while the product smells nice, it is a little strong for my tastes.</li>
            <li>Stays soft but holds.</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;m having trouble finding a way to clear it so it&#x27;ll spray.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out hair or become sticky or heavy.</li>
            <li> Even using a little, left the hair stiff.</li>
            <li> I replaced my former big sexy hairspray - it was leaving a terrible white residue on my hair that was difficult to wash out.</li>
            <li> (But I am typically an unscented product person. )</li>
            <li> Not too heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li> I was not able to restyle once sprayed!</li>
            <li> Not happy about that at allðŸ˜¡</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very thin and brittle while also being frizzy curly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky on your hair but the spray nozzle gums up terribly</li>

            <li> I was first turned on to this brand by my hair stylist who always sprays my blowout with something from this brand every time I see her. I couldn&#x27;t remember the name, but I could definitely remember the label/packaging. I searched Amazon and finally found it! Ugh, it smells so good I can&#x27;t stand it.&lt;br /&gt;Sprayed my freshly straighten hair with this stuff, brushed it out mildly.... Then went outside (while it was humid and damp and drizzling). When I came back 4 hours later, my hair looked just as good as it did when I first left the house.&lt;br /&gt;So pleased with this stuff. I&#x27;ll be buying more products from this brand.</li>
            <li> Best hairspray.  Holds with featherlight feel.  Smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Excellent hairspray. Best I have ever used! Doesn&#x27;t dry out hair or become sticky or heavy. Stays soft but holds. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Best hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray, provides perfect hold and smells wonderful!! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> This hairspray works wonderfully on my hair.  Not sticky and not too light and it smells fabulous to boot.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.  I&#x27;m loving this company&#x27;s stuff.</li>
            <li> Awesome hairspray! Smells amazing and very touchable!!</li>
            <li> Amazing hairspray that holds great and smells wonderful! Love the retro can too!!</li>
            <li> Best. Hairspray. EVER!!  I LOVE this stuff!!  The smell is INCREDIBLE, even my 7 year old likes it.  It has great hold without being crunchy.  My hair is very thin and brittle while also being frizzy curly so I can&#x27;t use mega hold hairsprays I need something that allows my hair to move.</li>
            <li> Great hairspray!!  Smells good and holds really well without leaving a sticky or stiff residue.  I have baby fine flyaway hair that is easy to weigh down and this hairspray gives a good hold, controls the frizz, but yet isn&#x27;t stiff or sticky.  And it smells really good - it doesn&#x27;t have a chemical smell that most hairsprays have.  I replaced my former big sexy hairspray - it was leaving a terrible white residue on my hair that was difficult to wash out.</li>
            <li> Smells and works great!</li>
            <li> Everything is described would buy again</li>
            <li> I enjoy amika products.  My only complaint is that while the product smells nice, it is a little strong for my tastes. (But I am typically an unscented product person. )&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know that is works better than my drug store hair spray...</li>
            <li> I needed to pull my hair back and make it stay. This product gave me the classic look I was going for and smelled GREAT!! AWESOME!!</li>
            <li> Love product.  Excellent delivery time by company</li>
            <li> This product smells amazing, and it holds my curls all night. Not too heavy or sticky. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> smellllls soooooooo good !!</li>
            <li> Did not find anything special about this hairspray! Even using a little, left the hair stiff. I was not able to restyle once sprayed!</li>
            <li> The only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars was the clogging problem.  It&#x27;s not sticky on your hair but the spray nozzle gums up terribly and I&#x27;m having trouble finding a way to clear it so it&#x27;ll spray.  Not happy about that at allðŸ˜¡</li>
