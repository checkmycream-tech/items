            <li> I don&#x27;t like getting things so late when you get the money right away.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how it does for that yet, but I really don&#x27;t want to open the bottle again.</li>
            <li> the bottle will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> It took to long to get here.</li>
            <li> it wont come back, Tinnitus is a phantom sound in the brain, so these products are fake ones!</li>

            <li> My stretchmarks are still there, but the rough edges of ripped skin are smoother than before.</li>
            <li> And mixing it with other oils is truly remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually less oily at the end of the day now.</li>
            <li> Gee, if I&#x27;d known that getting a bottle would mean no one got hurt, I would have gotten one a long time ago!</li>
            <li> The scent takes a little getting used to, but I continue to use it twice a day because I&#x27;m getting results!</li>
            <li> as for results, I haven&#x27;t used it enough, nor do I want too because the smell is terrible!!!</li>
            <li> The smell is absolutely terrible and I am usually tolerable to smell but this just lingeres in the room I opened to the bottle in.</li>
            <li> It smells so bad, that I can&#x27;t use it anywhere on my body.  </li>
            <li> My son had a terrible lingering cough.</li>

            <li> Another E.O. that doesn&#x27;t smell wonderful when you first open it, but it has amazing healing properties for bruises and sore muscles. I add a few drops, with carrot, lavender, and frankincense to make a lovely facial oil that I use before bed. I use Argan oil but it works with any carrier oil or lotion.</li>
            <li> It smells so bad, that I can&#x27;t use it anywhere on my body.  I&#x27;ve tried twice, but have had to wash it off. So I can&#x27;t tell if it works or not.</li>
            <li> I use this every day. This oil is amazing and at a great price. I can&#x27;t live without it &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Very intriguing scent! It feels great on my skin, treating a recent scar and I am already seeing results...</li>
            <li> i heard reviews that this product is good for tinnitus it is a fake! tinnitus has no treatment. I expirienced everything, when u lose ur hearing, it is gone! it wont come back, Tinnitus is a phantom sound in the brain, so these products are fake ones!</li>
            <li> My wife purchased this to make a mix with peppermint essential and and sweet almond carrier oil.  The mix is rubbed onto her fingers, hands, and feet to help ease the pain of her neuropathy.  Her pain is chemo related but we learned about it from a diabetic that has this issue too.  The product was delivered quickly, and was well packacked.  Thank you for the quality, it is easing her neuropathy.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great! I had a basil cell carcinoma removed and it wasn&#x27;t healing up, until I started putting a drop of this mixed equal parts with lavandula augustifolia, and then equal parts that mixture with jojoba oil, on it. What a difference! I also use this mixture now on my face instead of lotion. I&#x27;m actually less oily at the end of the day now.</li>
            <li> This has been wonderful to use and will be buying it again.  It is essential to the basics in oils.  I use this on an burn scar I&#x27;ve been trying to get rid of.  Read a book and it has so many uses.  We use it for our ears too.</li>
            <li> I add a few drops of oil to a unscented cream and massage into my neck especially the vetebrae ,at bedtime. I am able to sleep comfortablely and peacefully.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying this oil and its really great for post workout muscle soreness. Pretty much makes it dissolve a few minutes after rubbing into the sore area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the face its consistency is a bit too oily for my skin so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it as an astringent</li>
            <li> It took to long to get here. I just got it.check back with me later on. I don&#x27;t like getting things so late when you get the money right away.</li>
            <li> It takes care of many skin problems, it is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Best price also, It smells a bit, but outweighs the benefits</li>
            <li> Bought this and many other oils for the wife.  I am thoroughly impressed with the quality of Edens Gardens Essential Oils.  They seem to utilize excellent extraction procedures as well as quality control in the manufacture of their products.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend to anyone interested in essential oils.</li>
            <li> I love this oil!!!  Helped in my acute stage of lower back herniated disc, mine was so severe and the pain was literally excruciating. This oil really helped a lot in easing the pain. I believe Helichrysum oils are good for sciatica and herniated disc. I already finished it. Then bought a different brand and different name - H. gymnocephalum which is also anti-inflammatory but as I&#x27;ve read it is effective mostly on bronchial problems. Looking forward to buy this again.. I kept on buying oils like panaway from YL (Helichrysum is one of the oils here),  painaid from plant therapy, different kinds of frankincense oils.. And mixing it with other oils is truly remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;And the company (edens Garden) is excellent in terms of doing transaction with them. Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I ORDERED THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER FOR HER MIGRAINES.I HAD HER MASSAGE IT INTO HER FEET AT NIGHT. AT THE SAME TIME SHE ALSO GOT OFF HER MIGRAIN MEDS. WE WENT THROUGH A WEEK WITH MO MIGRAINS AT ALL. THIS IS ALSO THE WEEK AFTER HALLOWEEN. WITH ALL THE CHOCOLATE SHE HAD SHE SHOULD OF HAD ALOT OF THEM. NOT A ONE. IN FACT ONE NIGHT SHE STAYED OVER HER FRIENDS HOUSE AND DID NOT HAVE HER OIL. STILL NO MIGHAINE.</li>
            <li> Great product, quick shipping!  More people need to know about the benefits of Helichrysum!</li>
            <li> I used this oil after ear surgery to help with the healing.  It smells nice and seemed to help, doctor told me it&#x27;s healed and doing well.</li>
            <li> Best in quality, benefit, and cost. The 100% therapeutic grades as well as the Synergy Blends are fabulous. For the price you pay is well worth every penny in beneficial results.</li>
            <li> THIS SURE HELPS THE PAIN IN DIFFERENT PLACES ON YOUR BODY.  I REALLY LIKE THIS.</li>
            <li> Smell is OVERWELMING!!!! I tried to dilute it with some carrier oils and some fragrance oils and I just can&#x27;t get rid of the smell...as for results, I haven&#x27;t used it enough, nor do I want too because the smell is terrible!!! OMG, I know that tea tree oil has a strong scent but THAT I could handle, this stuff...forget it. Don&#x27;t say I didn&#x27;t warn you. Now this just sits on my dresser like decor.</li>
            <li> The smell is so strong it gives me headaches. The smell is absolutely terrible and I am usually tolerable to smell but this just lingeres in the room I opened to the bottle in. I bought it for skincare so I&#x27;m not sure how it does for that yet, but I really don&#x27;t want to open the bottle again.</li>
            <li> I Love it!  Would buy another in a heart-beat!</li>
            <li> My son had a terrible lingering cough. After Applying this product and using it in our air diffuser, he is cough free and felt completely better only after 48 hours. Natural just works better!</li>
            <li> Great product with a nice earthy smell. I use it for ear problems, if there is ringing in the ears or hearing loss.</li>
            <li> They shipped so quickly (now I know why shipping was steep)- and I was able to get my oil right in the fridge to help it last longer. I use it for stretchmarks. I mix with rosehip seed oil. My stretchmarks are still there, but the rough edges of ripped skin are smoother than before. That&#x27;s better than nothing.</li>
            <li> Really this is a great essential oil.  Don&#x27;t use too much because it is strong and the bottle will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> I got this on the advice of a friend who had used Youngevity&#x27;s Trauma Oil.  That pure product is no longer available, but this seemed to be close in purity.  As soon as I got it, I wanted to try it out but... we haven&#x27;t had an injury since, so I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try it - thank God!  Gee, if I&#x27;d known that getting a bottle would mean no one got hurt, I would have gotten one a long time ago!</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil as Helichrysum is known to help reduce scar tissue. I&#x27;d had 2 knee surgeries within five months, so I have 2 scars in the same place. Within five days of use, my scar became supple and less obvious -- even my physical therapist appreciated that! Since the oil absorbs into the skin, I think it&#x27;s had an effect on the internal scarring, also. The scent takes a little getting used to, but I continue to use it twice a day because I&#x27;m getting results!</li>
