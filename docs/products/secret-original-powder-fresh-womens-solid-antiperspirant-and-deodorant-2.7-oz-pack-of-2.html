            <li>The powder fresh scent isn&#x27;t overpowering and the product works...even during Crossfit WODs.  </li>

            <li>I love this scent and it seems to last all day.  </li>
            <li>Younger girls using deodorant for the first time don&#x27;t know any better so they will buy these inferior products because there is nothing else.</li>
            <li>Actually its&#x27;t healthy then</li>
            <li>/&gt;i dont perspire much, so all deodorants work for me.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>Please note that the white does leave a residue, so be careful when putting on your top!</li>
            <li>It is very hard to find a deodorant that works as good.</li>
            <li>keeps me fresh, last long and is very economical it is a wow underarm</li>
            <li>Just plain that I have used for most of my life</li>
            <li>I found out that Arrid (my next favorite choice) did the same thing with their deodorant (probably same company!)</li>
            <li>For over 20 years I was able to buy Secret ORIGINAL solid.</li>
            <li>I sincerely hope Secret doesn&#x27;t quit making this because I literally cannot use anything else.</li>

            <li> but it is completely dry when it goes on.  </li>
            <li> I am forced to look for a new deodorant.</li>
            <li> The OLDer Secret scent was mild but would last for at least 2 days if you didn&#x27;t sweat hard.</li>
            <li> Problem is, it&#x27;s getting harder to find.</li>
            <li> I hope Amazon keeps stocking it because its getting harder and harder to find.</li>

            <li> I am sick of this substituting new junk for old dependable products!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing like the classic Secret!</li>
            <li> I have also found that I sweat more with Secret than any other deodorant brand :(.</li>
            <li> Can you imagine how frustrating and annoying it is to go get your &amp;#34;usual&amp;#34; deodorant that you&#x27;ve depended on to work and smell nice for YEARS and instead find it&#x27;s been replaced by an inferior substitute?</li>
            <li> I mean, what else can you expect from deodorant.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from excessive sweating, then stay away from Secret.</li>
            <li> They must think we don&#x27;t notice or will accept any old crap they offer us.</li>
            <li> I have been using Secret for over 15 years.</li>
            <li> Secret, please don&#x27;t quit me.</li>
            <li> I always use Secret.  </li>
            <li> I am getting SO tired of companies changes things for the worst.</li>
            <li> I just hate the method of purchase.  </li>

            <li> Great product. Been using suave powder fresh deodorant for years. Never fails.</li>
            <li> I have been using Secret for over 15 years. It is very hard to find a deodorant that works as good. I have never had any problems with this one like I do with the others. Such as not lasting throughout the whole day or irritating my skin. There is a reason why Secret is one of the most expensive deodorants on the market.</li>
            <li> keeps me fresh, last long and is very economical it is a wow underarm but it gets the job done.  i love it.  I just hate the method of purchase.  i dont necessary need all that but i am taking it still</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant for years, but, interestingly, so has my husband!  He says it is the best deodorant around and doesn&#x27;t irritate his underarms.  (Hey, I knew that, but I shave...he doesn&#x27;t!)  The powder fresh scent isn&#x27;t overpowering and the product works...even during Crossfit WODs.  What else can we ask of it?</li>
            <li> Secrets great stuff. Always performs.</li>
            <li> I love this scent and it seems to last all day.  I find its a better deal to stock up by ordering multi packs.</li>
            <li> the smell reminds me of sweaty arm pits... probably a personal thing...&lt;br /&gt;i dont perspire much, so all deodorants work for me.</li>
            <li> This is the product my husband and I have both used for years.We were tired of buying this in the store and then when we would get ready to use it many times the dial was broken. We love this product, it works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since I was a teenager. Yeah, I know. I&#x27;ve tried other versions, other brands. But everything is that invisible solid crud. And guess what? I&#x27;m allergic to those! I break out every time I&#x27;ve tried to switch to anything &amp;#34;invisible.&amp;#34; So, I keep coming back to this. Problem is, it&#x27;s getting harder to find. I sincerely hope Secret doesn&#x27;t quit making this because I literally cannot use anything else. Secret, please don&#x27;t quit me.</li>
            <li> I mean, what else can you expect from deodorant. Nice that i didn&#x27;t have to buy in store and it came right to my door.</li>
            <li> It makes you smell nice and keeps the pits in good shape.  What else can you hope for in a product like this?</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant/antiperspirant.  Just plain that I have used for most of my life and it&#x27;s the original.  Not the invisible solid...just the solid.  Yes, it probably leaves white on my clothes or sheets but it is completely dry when it goes on.  I hope Amazon keeps stocking it because its getting harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing like the classic Secret! I have always loved this formula and scent. Please note that the white does leave a residue, so be careful when putting on your top!</li>
            <li> I always use Secret.  I bought it via amazon, as I have it set up to ship automatically on a specified schedule, &amp; receive a percentage discount thru the \\&quot;subscribe &amp; save\\&quot; program.  It is helpful to have the Prime account when being part of this program, as it provides free shipping.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from excessive sweating, then stay away from Secret. It does nothing. For me it lasts around 2 hours tops until I start smelling! I have also found that I sweat more with Secret than any other deodorant brand :(.</li>
            <li> I am getting SO tired of companies changes things for the worst. For over 20 years I was able to buy Secret ORIGINAL solid. It had a very nice, clean soapy scent. Not a baby powder scent like this one. Now that they&#x27;ve added all these other scents (none of which I can stand) I am forced to look for a new deodorant. Can you imagine how frustrating and annoying it is to go get your &amp;#34;usual&amp;#34; deodorant that you&#x27;ve depended on to work and smell nice for YEARS and instead find it&#x27;s been replaced by an inferior substitute? This is what has happened and it does not work well at all. The OLDer Secret scent was mild but would last for at least 2 days if you didn&#x27;t sweat hard. It also did not make your armpits itch and smell like a cheap perfume or cheap mens cologne. But they went and changed it - so now I am on the lookout for a new brand!!! Feel free to leave a suggestion in the comments. I found out that Arrid (my next favorite choice) did the same thing with their deodorant (probably same company!) so dont suggest that one. They must think we don&#x27;t notice or will accept any old crap they offer us. Younger girls using deodorant for the first time don&#x27;t know any better so they will buy these inferior products because there is nothing else. I am sick of this substituting new junk for old dependable products! I refuse to buy them!!</li>
            <li> It works very well. Actually its&#x27;t healthy then deidorant is so strong, but in summer it helps very much</li>
            <li> very quick delivery and good price</li>
