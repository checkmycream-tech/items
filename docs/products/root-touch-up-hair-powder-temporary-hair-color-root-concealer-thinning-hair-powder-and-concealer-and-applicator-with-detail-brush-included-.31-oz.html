            <li>Good for bleach blondes.</li>
            <li>Had good review but didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>This root cover works surprisingly well and does not come off until you wash your hair.</li>
            <li>It works great, just make sure you rub it in.</li>
            <li>So glad I did!  </li>
            <li>Also good for giving my hair more body.</li>
            <li>and this product came out nice :)</li>
            <li>best I&#x27;ve found so far is CAKE hair powder for lighter shades.  </li>
            <li>Blends in easily!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this!</li>
            <li>but it covered it up nicely, was easy to use</li>
            <li>Might work better with hair that&#x27;s curly or has more volume.</li>
            <li>This product was fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Madison Reed is a million times better.</li>
            <li>but it was more expensive…I decided to try it anyways.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this product and</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Most products are spray or liquid formulations designed for covering gray roots.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be being more!!!</li>
            <li>I love how light it is - like a very fine powder.  </li>
            <li>Perfect as a dry shampoo too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit too light, but better coverage and price.</li>
            <li>Amazing product, buy as gifts for my blonde friends who all love it!</li>
            <li>Important to blend it.</li>
            <li>Super easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I received  a discount for my honest opinion and would highly recommend this Temporary root  cover up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I found this product, because there is nothing I hate more than having roots, and I&#x27;m now able to extend my hair appoints a good 2 weeks longer, or more.</li>
            <li>My only issue is that you can&#x27;t use it as strategically or sparingly as I might want -- you kind of dump a quarter size in an area and use the brush to make it look more natural.</li>
            <li>I bought this color and also warm blonde.  </li>
            <li>I did a video demo with the warm blonde that can be found on YouTube.</li>
            <li>I got this in the mail at just the right time about a week before I was going to color the gray and some roots.  </li>
            <li>Thus, started my search to find the right product.  </li>
            <li>is the best product I have found to date that works well with camouflaging dark roots on platinum blonde hair.</li>
            <li>Works really good on my dark and gray root growth.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the light blonde and was worried it would be too light</li>
            <li>My hair is a platinum-ashy/gray/white color, so I think if the company made a version that had more neutral white to ash coloring I&#x27;d be willing to try it again.</li>
            <li>But it definitely works better than any of the products I&#x27;ve tried and is cheaper.</li>
            <li>I had to wait a good 3-4 weeks before my stylist was back from her maternity leave, which left me with some quite noticeable roots.  </li>
            <li>If you have pale platinum blonde hair that has more of a golden or yellow tone you would probably be more satisfied.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about this but wanted to find something that could cover the grey until I have time to color.  </li>
            <li>It was very easy to apply and did not weigh down my hair at all.  </li>
            <li>I found it hard to find a good temporary cover for gray on light blonde hair...</li>
            <li>It really helps to blend in the roots.</li>
            <li>drawback was the powder really doesn&#x27;t release out of the brush</li>
            <li>With my dark roots I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would work</li>
            <li>Rootflage works much better in covering up the dark wherever I think it&#x27;s needed.</li>
            <li>It makes my roots a tad bit less noticeable, but does not seem to adhere well to my hair and mostly falls to my scalp.</li>
            <li>I tried the light blonde and it looked so natural in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Good concept at least!</li>
            <li>I have used several different products to cover my roots and this product is better by far!</li>
            <li>Fun product for brightening up your blonde hair in between coloring!  </li>
            <li>well worth the extra money for it.  </li>
            <li>I have darker hair with blonde highlights pretty much all over.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, easy to use, doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and it covers my roots enough to get by till my next appointment.</li>
            <li>The coverage is amazing, especially being my natural hair is so dark naturally, and it also covers my white/gray hair equally as well.</li>
            <li>Wow root cover up--</li>
            <li>Just be careful when opening up the bottle because the powder and is higher than the container, plenty of product</li>
            <li>This light blonde color did nothing for me, and it seems to get clogged easier than my other bottle I bought from Rootflage on Amazon, so I left off a star in my rating.  </li>
            <li>The product covered my dark blonde roots much better than I expected, but the color was very yellow.</li>
            <li>I have been a hairstylists dream for many years with my every 3-5 week appointments for my dark, and now dark mixed with gray roots!</li>

            <li> I have highlighted blonde hair with dark roots and I have been looking for a product to cover them until the next time I go to the salon.</li>
            <li> It worked some but was much more expensive for much less product ($35).</li>
            <li> I also like the dry shampoo affect, which hides those days when I don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair.</li>
            <li> I gave this 4 stars based mainly on the fact that the color was not a good match.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good for my hair (long, fine, straight, blonde highlights with brown base, medium thickness).</li>
            <li> the concept was good but the color was awful!  </li>
            <li> I saw a similar product at the local drugstore and thought I&#x27;d give it a try as I was desperate for a touch up.  </li>
            <li> It lighted a little but left my hair looking a little glittery and a weird color.</li>
            <li> and they say to put it on with your finger, so that part is a little confusing.</li>
            <li> but you use a small brush to apply it sparingly.  </li>
            <li> Small amount of product, didn&#x27;t cover well at all.  </li>
            <li> I have dirty blonde hair with some highlights.</li>
            <li> I was traveling and unable to see my stylist over 3 weeks,and  I had a family wedding after weeks away out of state and lots of photos would be taken.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed!  </li>
            <li> It is my fault for picking the wrong color, I think.  </li>
            <li> I found it also difficult to apply to some areas of my hair.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but was desperate.</li>
            <li> Needless to say that was not the look I was going for!</li>
            <li> Looks bad!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I gave this 4 stars based mainly on the fact that the color was not a good match. The product covered my dark blonde roots much better than I expected, but the color was very yellow. My hair is a platinum-ashy/gray/white color, so I think if the company made a version that had more neutral white to ash coloring I&#x27;d be willing to try it again. If you have pale platinum blonde hair that has more of a golden or yellow tone you would probably be more satisfied.</li>
            <li> Works surprisingly well. Not 100% coverage but enough coverage for that week or so before you get your roots touched up. Good for bleach blondes.</li>
            <li> Had good review but didn&#x27;t work for me. I have dirty blonde hair with some highlights. I wanted to find a root touch up for in between salon visits, but this didn&#x27;t work for me. It lighted a little but left my hair looking a little glittery and a weird color. I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> This product made my roots look whitish-gray (husband said I looked like George Washington) but it did leave shimmery yellow streaks on my face, which I was unaware of until I was out in public. Needless to say that was not the look I was going for! It&#x27;s not good for my hair (long, fine, straight, blonde highlights with brown base, medium thickness). Might work better with hair that&#x27;s curly or has more volume. Good concept at least!</li>
            <li> Fun product for brightening up your blonde hair in between coloring!  Super easy to apply.  Thought it would look powdery in your hair, but it doesn&#x27;t.  Blends in easily!</li>
            <li> it also helps cover bald spots</li>
            <li> I was traveling and unable to see my stylist over 3 weeks,and  I had a family wedding after weeks away out of state and lots of photos would be taken.  With my dark roots I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would work but it covered it up nicely, was easy to use and  I will keep this product handy every month going forward!  Hair with blow out and this product came out nice :)</li>
            <li> I tried everything to cover my roots.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best product I have found to date that works well with camouflaging dark roots on platinum blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I had to wait a good 3-4 weeks before my stylist was back from her maternity leave, which left me with some quite noticeable roots.  This product was fantastic!  Totally worked and blended well with my color.  As a bonus, it gave it some volume.  Would definitely recommend this product to buy you time before you see your colorist.</li>
            <li> this works great!! Stays in all day while at work. It matches your hi-lite color great!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this but wanted to find something that could cover the grey until I have time to color.  It works wonderfully~ I got this in the mail at just the right time about a week before I was going to color the gray and some roots.  I was so happy with the results!  I ordered the light blonde and was worried it would be too light but it&#x27;s perfect.  It was very easy to apply and did not weigh down my hair at all.  I love how light it is - like a very fine powder.  So happy that I found Rootflage (great name) and will reorder when I am out!  I received  a discount for my honest opinion and would highly recommend this Temporary root  cover up.</li>
            <li> This root cover works surprisingly well and does not come off until you wash your hair. Efficient sender. I do recommend.</li>
            <li> Madison Reed is a million times better. Save your money!</li>
            <li> I saw a similar product at the local drugstore and thought I&#x27;d give it a try as I was desperate for a touch up.  Well, you get what you pay for - the concept was good but the color was awful!  Thus, started my search to find the right product.  I had read the great reviews on Rootflage but it was more expensive…I decided to try it anyways.  So glad I did!  I LOVE this product and well worth the extra money for it.  You get 3 different options of blonde instead of just 1.  I tried the light blonde and it looked so natural in my hair.  In the long run, it&#x27;a actually saving me money as I don&#x27;t have to get my hair done as often. Thank you Rootflage!!</li>
            <li> Not impressed!  Looks bad!</li>
            <li> Amazing product, buy as gifts for my blonde friends who all love it! Perfect as a dry shampoo too.</li>
            <li> It makes my roots a tad bit less noticeable, but does not seem to adhere well to my hair and mostly falls to my scalp. I watched the video and have tried several times to replicate the results but no such luck.</li>
            <li> I was a sceptic because I thought \\&quot;how could a product actually hide re-growth\\&quot; however I am also one of those gals who wait to make a hair appointment until I actually start seeing my roots and by the time I&#x27;ve called my stylist she&#x27;s booking 3 weeks out. Yikes! I&#x27;ve then got a problem...how to get by until she can highlight my hair. Rootflage is the answer!!! I absolutely love this product. It&#x27;s light, easy to use, doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and it covers my roots enough to get by till my next appointment. Great product.</li>
            <li> good to cover brown roots growing!</li>
            <li> I have darker hair with blonde highlights pretty much all over.  I bought this color and also warm blonde.  This light blonde color did nothing for me, and it seems to get clogged easier than my other bottle I bought from Rootflage on Amazon, so I left off a star in my rating.  It is my fault for picking the wrong color, I think.  I did a video demo with the warm blonde that can be found on YouTube.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but was desperate. Saw all the great reviews so gave it a try. It works great, just make sure you rub it in. Also good for giving my hair more body.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this! I have been a hairstylists dream for many years with my every 3-5 week appointments for my dark, and now dark mixed with gray roots! I&#x27;m so happy I found this product, because there is nothing I hate more than having roots, and I&#x27;m now able to extend my hair appoints a good 2 weeks longer, or more. The coverage is amazing, especially being my natural hair is so dark naturally, and it also covers my white/gray hair equally as well. I also like the dry shampoo affect, which hides those days when I don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair. I will definitely be being more!!!</li>
            <li> I have used several different products to cover my roots and this product is better by far! It really helps to blend in the roots. I will continue to purchase this product in the future.</li>
            <li> I have highlighted blonde hair with dark roots and I have been looking for a product to cover them until the next time I go to the salon. Most products are spray or liquid formulations designed for covering gray roots. I tried Rita Hazan root concealer (two different types) for blondes and it didn&#x27;t work at all. I also used Color Wow root cover up-- it&#x27;s a powder like rootflage but you use a small brush to apply it sparingly.  It worked some but was much more expensive for much less product ($35). I found it also difficult to apply to some areas of my hair. Rootflage works much better in covering up the dark wherever I think it&#x27;s needed. My only issue is that you can&#x27;t use it as strategically or sparingly as I might want -- you kind of dump a quarter size in an area and use the brush to make it look more natural. But it definitely works better than any of the products I&#x27;ve tried and is cheaper. It&#x27;s definitely a keeper!</li>
            <li> Works really good on my dark and gray root growth.  Important to blend it.</li>
            <li> I found it hard to find a good temporary cover for gray on light blonde hair...this worked great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only drawback was the powder really doesn&#x27;t release out of the brush and they say to put it on with your finger, so that part is a little confusing. Just be careful when opening up the bottle because the powder and is higher than the container, plenty of product and that&#x27;s a good thing!</li>
            <li> Small amount of product, didn&#x27;t cover well at all.  To get coverage you need to use a lot of the product---Not with the money.&lt;br /&gt;The best I&#x27;ve found so far is CAKE hair powder for lighter shades.  It&#x27;s a bit too light, but better coverage and price.</li>
