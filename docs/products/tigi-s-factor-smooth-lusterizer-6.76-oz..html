            <li>Love this product and have been using it for about 5 years.  </li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>So glad I found</li>
            <li>It smooths fly away hair and adds a nice shine at the same time.</li>
            <li>I liked it the first two times I used it, but after using it 3 or 4 times, my hair had no body at all and would not hold a style.</li>
            <li>It calms my frizzyness down, and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>I have really fine hair</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great and conditions/softens/smooths hair pretty decently.</li>
            <li>leaving my hair shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>Will continue to buy this product from this vendor when available</li>
            <li>My wife says it works great, using has made getting ready for work so much easier and quicker.</li>
            <li>My daughter has exceptionally long hair, and this product works beautifully on her, making it smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>I do not like the smell of the product though; smells like strawberries and is way too sweet.  </li>
            <li>It creates soft, smooth hair.</li>
            <li>I apply all over my wet hair before blow drying and it smooths it so nicely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It absolutely eliminates frizz!  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, and I would recommend it to anyone looking to tame the wild hair they have.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced for what you get and what it does.</li>
            <li>but it does the trick if you don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li>I wear my hair straight or curly.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much of this product even if you have tons of hair.</li>
            <li>Much more than I expected.</li>
            <li>will buy this again and again, as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this!</li>
            <li>I have very fine, soft hair that has natural curl if I let it dry naturally.  </li>
            <li>It makes it soft too!</li>
            <li>I used to use it only when I blow dried my hair straight and was so surprised when one day I added it to my curls, since most lusterizing products are too heavy for fine curly hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is a frizzy mess, but once I add this, it is smooth and skinny.  </li>
            <li>Surprised that Tigi go made this product.</li>
            <li>have only found one other product that really does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;Although a little pricey for our budget, Tigi smells good, and you only need a tiny bit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I seriously, have gotten so many compliments on the shine of my hair.</li>
            <li>I am editing my original review because after using this a few times it left my thick, but fine hair limp and lifeless.</li>

            <li> I am editing my original review because after using this a few times it left my thick, but fine hair limp and lifeless.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair and this allows me to wear it straight with the help of a round brush and flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my wet hair and let my curls air dry for shiny soft curls without frizz.  </li>
            <li> But does not last to fight the frizz all day long.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have to use a flat iron anymore!</li>
            <li> My hair is permed, not naturally curly, so</li>
            <li> I also use it on my dry hair to resoften,  shine and reshape my curls without worrying about my hair getting greasy.  </li>
            <li> I even use it on dry hair!  </li>
            <li> It spent make your hair greedy looking.  </li>
            <li> I like this product a lot because it helps fight frizz and flyaways without a heavy or oily texture left on your hair.  </li>
            <li> if I don&#x27;t scrunch my hair after using it, it&#x27;ll make it a little flat, but it helps hold the curl and eliminate frizz if I scrunch while applying to wet hair.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down</li>
            <li> My only complaint!</li>
            <li> I had tried to find other products that did the same thing, because TIGI is so expensive, but nothing works as well.</li>
            <li> It is not amazing</li>
            <li> I would recommend to every one with thin or thick hair!</li>
            <li> I have been using this sparingly, because it&#x27;s so darn expensive.</li>
            <li> Usually their products are horrible!</li>
