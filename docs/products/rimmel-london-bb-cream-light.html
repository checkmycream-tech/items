    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Very happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>I believe it&#x27;s the best off drugstore bb creams.</li>
            <li>This is the best BB cream on the market, I think.  </li>
            <li>Very good product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Makes my skin look great.</li>
            <li>Affordable and a great solution to what I needed.</li>
            <li>great coverage</li>
            <li>Well I love this stuff!!</li>
            <li>Always loved Rimmel and was happy to see when they made a bb cream</li>
            <li>Nice coverage and great value.  </li>
            <li>I feel like if I mix the two, I can get good coverage and good use out of this BB</li>
            <li>but this blurs/minimizes them fairly well.</li>
            <li>On a good day I&#x27;d be content with this and a finishing powder.</li>
            <li>I use the light color and it is the perfect shade for me.</li>
            <li>Even though it is a great one:)</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I was was wearing some kind of foundation or cream.  </li>
            <li>nice coverage</li>
            <li>I bought the light because I have a fair complexion.</li>
            <li>&quot;  This cream, however, is the best one so far.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it covers and protects&lt;br</li>
            <li>Co workers have commented that I look better.</li>
            <li>and I got it on sale for $4.99 at my grocery store, for that price I might as well as give it a shot :-)</li>
            <li>But I reallllllly love this product.</li>
            <li>I for sure recommend this product, as I already have for my mother and sister and anyone else I can bug about it.</li>
            <li>I bought this product a couple weeks ago, and I love it.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll purchase again for sure.</li>
            <li>I found Pond&#x27;s luminous finish BB cream to be better for keeping the shine away.</li>
            <li>I have finally found the perfect BB cream... for me!</li>
            <li>I found this at CVS at a deal of buy one get one 50 percent off :) it was under eight dollars for one as opposed to some of the prices I seen elsewhere</li>
            <li>I bought mine in-store at Target for $6.50 and am more than satisfied.</li>
            <li>It is the right shade, good texture, doesn&#x27;t clog pores and doesn&#x27;t make my face all pasty or gunky.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Coverage is pretty good.</li>
            <li>And if you&#x27;re someone who doesn&#x27;t wear much makeup, it&#x27;s a good option as well.</li>
            <li>It has a rich pigment and blends very smoothly.</li>
            <li>VERY QUICK.</li>
            <li>Rimmel now has a loyal customer!</li>
            <li>(lucky me!).</li>
            <li>They offer pretty good quality for very reasonable prices.</li>
            <li>I have gotten a few compliments about how flawless and smooth my face looks with it on.</li>
            <li>It was matte and went on smooth</li>
            <li>it is light weight and blends well into my skin.</li>
            <li>I really do enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>It is a good concealer and most important - it stays on for the entire day, you don&#x27;t have to do any touch-ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Good product overall :)</li>
            <li>&amp; it matches my pale winter skin perfectly.</li>
            <li>With that being said the time and effort it takes to get this bb cream to look smooth and not gunky isn&#x27;t worth it!</li>
            <li>If someone is more on the oily or dry side, though, I suspect they might not like this so much.&lt;br /&gt;The drugstore price is good --</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, for the price that I paid, I am not completely disappointed.</li>
            <li>But the product blends in nicely and looks very natural.  </li>
            <li>Good quality product overall.  </li>
            <li>I DO (and/will) recommend it to people who don&#x27;t have as many blemishes/blotches as myself and are looking for a decent BB cream without paying an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li>so you need to be quick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s for sure not all cakey or think like normal foundation can be.</li>
            <li>Now, I love Rimmel and pretty much all of their products</li>
            <li>however, I can be easy to apply too much.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it is just because I am used to my Naked foundation by Urban Decay which is extremely light and has great coverage.</li>
            <li>so I bought it for $3.50, figuring it was worth a try at that</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t blend and isn&#x27;t absorbed by the skin.</li>
            <li>It applied pretty smooth, but after I put on finishing powder it got really cakey.</li>
            <li>They were either too dark, too oily or just didn&#x27;t deliver \\&quot;the nice and smooth</li>
            <li>Application does have to be rather fast, as the cream dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>Besides that, this is a great product and I recommend it to people who don&#x27;t have extremely oily skin and don&#x27;t live in a place where it is hot all the time.</li>
            <li>It dries very fast</li>
            <li>I have olive skin undertones and was worried at first glance at the color of the cream coming out of the tube.  </li>
            <li>I doubt it&#x27;s a true BB cream, as in the Asian ones that are legendary for all their coverage and benefits, but it&#x27;s a nice tinted moisturizer that&#x27;s a bit less sheer than some other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>the $15 listed here is way too much; go to Walgreens or wherever and you can get this, a lipstick and a nail polish for the same price, when it&#x27;s not on sale, and more when it is -- and I like the coverage, and that it has SPF to protect against the sun.</li>
            <li>At first look it seems a bit like it&#x27;d be off (too beige-y or something) but it blends very well, and I have no issues with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no strong scent, which is also good, and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or drying on my (mostly) normal skin.</li>
            <li>When applied right this looks very natural.</li>
            <li>Consequently it &amp;#34;outlines&amp;#34; the pores, especially on the nose, making them look huge.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the product very well.  </li>
            <li>It really minimizes my pores, and I have no need for primer or concealer.</li>
            <li>It covers my face very well and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I do still need some powder, but that is just because my face is naturally really oily.</li>
            <li>i really like this BB cream</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that if this happens you can wet you hand and rub it in better.</li>
            <li>For anyone who still wants to give this a try after reading my review..I bought the \\&quot;light\\&quot; shade and it matches my MAC NW20 studio fix.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and</li>
            <li>I live in Houston, Texas, where it is very humid and hot.</li>
            <li>This is the first product EVER to clear up my acne.</li>
            <li>I gave it one star because amazingly I didn&#x27;t turn red or break out, and it actually covered my natural redness and eye bags.</li>
            <li>So I mixed it with my true match concealer to lighten it up.</li>
            <li>And it stays on top of the dark spots, leaving a scaly look.</li>
            <li>It eliminates the need to add a powder to set, as well as primer with a decent spf.</li>
            <li>After all the time and effort it looks decent and didn&#x27;t make me look any more oily than usual</li>
            <li>decent coverage on my face, but I used a little on my dark circles and it wasn&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li>It made my skin darker than it really is and did not get rid of my major blotches.</li>
            <li>I just bought the same exact thing at walmart for $6.47.</li>
            <li>I bought this in the lightest shade available and it is still too dark for my milky skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is probably best for those who are not particularly blotchy and only have a few minimal problem zones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This covers imperfection well, has no scent, is not heavy on my skin, and leaves my face very soft.</li>
            <li>My cheeks are a lot less red and blotchy, but I even made sure to thoroughly cover the side of my face and chin and those blotches are still just the same!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am 68 years old.</li>
            <li>No skin problems so far..</li>
            <li>I was really surprised at this.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not heavy or greasy at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a crazy red to where I am embarrassed to go out in public with it, but it is noticeable.</li>
            <li>but there are good deals on cosmetics on amazon just not this one sadly.</li>
            <li>that is the only thing that makes it decent.</li>
            <li>And if I do get hot, even just the tiniest bit, this foundation tends to melt on my face, mostly above my upper lip.</li>
            <li>I bought it in Light, for much less at Walgreens (they actually had a half-off sale</li>
            <li>It rubbed on smooth but after a little, it looked very obvious</li>
            <li>price.)&lt;br /&gt;Coverage is decent, and it blends in pretty well with my pale skin (I&#x27;m something around a MAC NC20 shade) and this works well on me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good all-in-one option for casual days, when a lot of makeup isn&#x27;t necessary, but you still want some sun protection and cover.</li>
            <li>It has other benefits and has a very nice/light coverage and sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t wear anything else on my face before this stuff, besides sunscreen, and some loose powder.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Bought the Rimmel BB cream about a month ago. Use it 3 times a week when I go to work.  I am 68 years old. Bought med/dark as I am a Florida boater so am in the sun every weekend. I love the way it covers and protects&lt;br /&gt;Makes my skin look great. Co workers have commented that I look better. Hello....who does &#x27;nt want to hear that...Will buy again. No skin problems so far..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the product very well.  It was matte and went on smooth but it was very dark.  Even in the lightest shade.  Second is also cakey.  It rubbed on smooth but after a little, it looked very obvious I was was wearing some kind of foundation or cream.  Overall, I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised at this. it is light weight and blends well into my skin. decent coverage on my face, but I used a little on my dark circles and it wasn&#x27;t as good. that is the only thing that makes it decent. and I got it on sale for $4.99 at my grocery store, for that price I might as well as give it a shot :-)</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase.  Nice coverage and great value.  Good quality product overall.  Would order again.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I already have decent skin, you know besides some pore appearance, and discoloration or dark spots, I&#x27;m not too bad, but this just covers up allllll the little imperfections I have. I normally don&#x27;t wear anything else on my face before this stuff, besides sunscreen, and some loose powder. But I reallllllly love this product. It has other benefits and has a very nice/light coverage and sunscreen. It last all day. I have gotten a few compliments about how flawless and smooth my face looks with it on. It&#x27;s not drying or hard to blend. It&#x27;s for sure not all cakey or think like normal foundation can be. So far so good. I have only used it about a month and like I mentioned, this is my go-to BB Cream after trying about 3 others I didn&#x27;t care for. I for sure recommend this product, as I already have for my mother and sister and anyone else I can bug about it. I really do enjoy this product. Affordable and a great solution to what I needed.</li>
            <li> I have very pale skin, and the lightest shade is still way too dark. Like, orange Oompaloopa dark. It applied pretty smooth, but after I put on finishing powder it got really cakey.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product at Walgreens. I&#x27;d been considering trying out a BB cream as I have a few red blotches on my face. It&#x27;s not a crazy red to where I am embarrassed to go out in public with it, but it is noticeable. I bought the light because I have a fair complexion. It made my skin darker than it really is and did not get rid of my major blotches. My cheeks are a lot less red and blotchy, but I even made sure to thoroughly cover the side of my face and chin and those blotches are still just the same!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, for the price that I paid, I am not completely disappointed. It has a rich pigment and blends very smoothly. I also like the fact that it is SPF 25, but does not have that strong of a sunscreen scent like a few other SPF foundations that I have used in the past. It is also lightweight, but I CAN feel that I am wearing it. Perhaps it is just because I am used to my Naked foundation by Urban Decay which is extremely light and has great coverage. I feel like if I mix the two, I can get good coverage and good use out of this BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is probably best for those who are not particularly blotchy and only have a few minimal problem zones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be repurchasing this product (unless I can get it to work with my daily foundation.)&lt;br /&gt;But I DO (and/will) recommend it to people who don&#x27;t have as many blemishes/blotches as myself and are looking for a decent BB cream without paying an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> The bottle was nearly empty.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a couple weeks ago, and I love it. It really minimizes my pores, and I have no need for primer or concealer. It covers my face very well and lasts all day. I do still need some powder, but that is just because my face is naturally really oily. Now, I love Rimmel and pretty much all of their products so when I saw this, I went for it.&lt;br /&gt;It has one downside, though. I live in Houston, Texas, where it is very humid and hot. You can sweat just by going to get the mail. And if I do get hot, even just the tiniest bit, this foundation tends to melt on my face, mostly above my upper lip. It feels wet and looks awful, and when I dab it off it turns out that it&#x27;s not just me sweating, because all of the color comes off along with it, even though I am barely applying any pressure. It may be because of where I live, but it&#x27;s really annoying, and luckily only happens a few times. Besides that, this is a great product and I recommend it to people who don&#x27;t have extremely oily skin and don&#x27;t live in a place where it is hot all the time.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it! This is the first product EVER to clear up my acne. I have extremely dry skin that is prone to blotchy and irritation. This product was a tad too dark for me but i just mixed it with some lighter colored foundation and it did wonders. This product stays on all day and actually improved my skin. Rimmel now has a loyal customer!</li>
            <li> I like this product. I bought it in Light, for much less at Walgreens (they actually had a half-off sale so I bought it for $3.50, figuring it was worth a try at that price.)&lt;br /&gt;Coverage is decent, and it blends in pretty well with my pale skin (I&#x27;m something around a MAC NC20 shade) and this works well on me. At first look it seems a bit like it&#x27;d be off (too beige-y or something) but it blends very well, and I have no issues with it.&lt;br /&gt;Coverage is pretty good. I have a couple dark spots/scars that don&#x27;t cover all the way but this blurs/minimizes them fairly well. On a good day I&#x27;d be content with this and a finishing powder. (On a bad day, haul out the concealer for reinforcements!) There&#x27;s no strong scent, which is also good, and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or drying on my (mostly) normal skin. If someone is more on the oily or dry side, though, I suspect they might not like this so much.&lt;br /&gt;The drugstore price is good -- the $15 listed here is way too much; go to Walgreens or wherever and you can get this, a lipstick and a nail polish for the same price, when it&#x27;s not on sale, and more when it is -- and I like the coverage, and that it has SPF to protect against the sun. I doubt it&#x27;s a true BB cream, as in the Asian ones that are legendary for all their coverage and benefits, but it&#x27;s a nice tinted moisturizer that&#x27;s a bit less sheer than some other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! But the pricing is out rages. I just bought the same exact thing at walmart for $6.47. Same thing, same size, same color.</li>
            <li> i really like this BB cream, it&#x27;s a little pricy but a little goes a long way &amp; it matches my pale winter skin perfectly. doesn&#x27;t reek like some BB-tinted moisturizer-foundations i have. nice coverage-it evens tone &amp; covers minor flaws but it&#x27;s not heavy or greasy at all. i&#x27;m the type that is oily AND flaky/peely in winter (lucky me!). i&#x27;ll purchase again for sure.</li>
            <li> I believe it&#x27;s the best off drugstore bb creams. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I found this at Walgreen&#x27;s for about 1/3 of Amazon price.  Was under $3.50. This is my 2nd tube of it. Don&#x27;t try to do your entire face at once or it cakes up. I wish it came in a bigger tube.  I have it 4 stars for this.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> This covers well for a BB cream but, for me, it made my face extremely shinny. I found Pond&#x27;s luminous finish BB cream to be better for keeping the shine away.</li>
            <li> I bought this in the lightest shade available and it is still too dark for my milky skin. So I mixed it with my true match concealer to lighten it up. This covers imperfection well, has no scent, is not heavy on my skin, and leaves my face very soft. When applied right this looks very natural. however, I can be easy to apply too much. I&#x27;ve found that if this happens you can wet you hand and rub it in better.</li>
            <li> I ordered this wondering what all the &amp;#34;BB cream&amp;#34; fad was all about. Well I love this stuff!! great coverage and it does not make be break out!</li>
            <li> This is the best BB cream on the market, I think.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s hard to find locally.</li>
            <li> I received mine with an expired date. I received it 6/24/2015 and the experation date was 08/2014.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible, so bad that I emailed the company, but after two weeks haven&#x27;t received a response. It doesn&#x27;t blend and isn&#x27;t absorbed by the skin. Consequently it &amp;#34;outlines&amp;#34; the pores, especially on the nose, making them look huge. And it stays on top of the dark spots, leaving a scaly look. I noticed the same comments by a couple other users.</li>
            <li> For anyone who still wants to give this a try after reading my review..I bought the \\&quot;light\\&quot; shade and it matches my MAC NW20 studio fix. Smells like a mix of foundation and sunscreen, others can smell it on me. For the price I thought I would give it a try as a transition from a very expensive foundation.  With that being said the time and effort it takes to get this bb cream to look smooth and not gunky isn&#x27;t worth it! It dries very fast so you need to be quick. VERY QUICK. I am having to use 2 fingers in a small circular motion around my whole face. It takes too long. Tried bigger strokes and it streaks and looks noticeable. Tried a blending sponge and it still takes a lot of time to get it looking decent, it just saves your fingers from being messy and your face from having excess finger oil applied to it. Does not dry matte like it claims, but it does dry. Looks bad over any drier skin areas. My nose has big pores and you can see the bb cream just sitting in them!! My foundation would fill/blend it but this is just a pain and chore to blend and deal with.  I gave it one star because amazingly I didn&#x27;t turn red or break out, and it actually covered my natural redness and eye bags. After all the time and effort it looks decent and didn&#x27;t make me look any more oily than usual but it does feel heavier as the day goes on..</li>
            <li> im still using it. its just a fancy sunblock for your face and smells like sunblock.</li>
            <li> I have finally found the perfect BB cream... for me! I have very oily skin and this BB cream does wonders for it like I had hoped others would for so long. I use the light color and it is the perfect shade for me. Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or look cakey. Lasts a long time. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have tried several BB creams and already gave up on them.  They were either too dark, too oily or just didn&#x27;t deliver \\&quot;the nice and smooth coverage.\\&quot;  This cream, however, is the best one so far.  It is the right shade, good texture, doesn&#x27;t clog pores and doesn&#x27;t make my face all pasty or gunky.  It is a good concealer and most important - it stays on for the entire day, you don&#x27;t have to do any touch-ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is, however, one con to this product - the price.  I purchased it at Target for half the price.  Sorry, Amazon, perhaps you want to reconsider how much you are charging for this product.  Even though it is a great one:)</li>
            <li> Always loved Rimmel and was happy to see when they made a bb cream I found this at CVS at a deal of buy one get one 50 percent off :) it was under eight dollars for one as opposed to some of the prices I seen elsewhere but there are good deals on cosmetics on amazon just not this one sadly. Good product overall :)</li>
            <li> I used this product twice and now have a red, blotchy, itchy, swollen and very uncomfortable face. Rimmel should remove this product from the market or issue a stern warning. I needed oral prednisone to function as topical steroid did nothing for me. I hope that I don&#x27;t have permanent hyperpigmentation from the irritation. Don&#x27;t buy this and tell your friends.</li>
            <li> I tend to like Rimmel products.  They offer pretty good quality for very reasonable prices. I have olive skin undertones and was worried at first glance at the color of the cream coming out of the tube.  But the product blends in nicely and looks very natural.  I have some dark spots, and yes they&#x27;re minimized.  Application does have to be rather fast, as the cream dries quickly.  It&#x27;s not oily at all, and definitely mattifies. It eliminates the need to add a powder to set, as well as primer with a decent spf. It&#x27;s a good all-in-one option for casual days, when a lot of makeup isn&#x27;t necessary, but you still want some sun protection and cover. And if you&#x27;re someone who doesn&#x27;t wear much makeup, it&#x27;s a good option as well. I bought mine in-store at Target for $6.50 and am more than satisfied.</li>
