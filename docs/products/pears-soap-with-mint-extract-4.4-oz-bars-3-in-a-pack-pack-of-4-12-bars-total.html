            <li>Great soap.</li>
            <li>Lathers well, smells great and not pricey at all.</li>
            <li>have been using it for years, great soap for me.</li>
            <li>Loved Pears soap for years.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.....</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s start with the fact that it&#x27;s in my favorite color-blue!  </li>
            <li>i love this soap very refreshing and feels good on the skin</li>
            <li>Smell is great so fresh smelling</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve liked Pears for years but this &amp;#34;Mint&amp;#34; is &amp;#34;REALLY&amp;#34; strong, almost makes your eyes water.</li>
            <li>Smells more like a cough drop than mint.</li>
            <li>This is more like a detergent than a soap.</li>
            <li>love the soap so iam carrying in my bag3 packs 2 as gifts to friens</li>
            <li>My favorite soap.</li>
            <li>My husbands favorite soap.  </li>
            <li>Love the feel on skins.</li>
            <li>greatest soap..fresh, clean, suds up enough for shampoo and shaving…mint is very refreshing and cooling on a hot day&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend</li>
            <li>Smells way more like cheap perfume than like mint and menthol.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a longtime fan of normal (gold) Pears soap, with its pleasant eucalyptus smell.  </li>
            <li>It does clean and it does lather rather well.</li>
            <li>Ive known for a while that this wasnt the same Pears soap we all loved.</li>
            <li>Good soap different fragrance</li>
            <li>It is very pretty, but beyond that it is all business: a very effective soap with a harsh industrial smell.</li>
            <li>Fresh mint scent, no scummy residue.  </li>
            <li>Good for the active person</li>
            <li>Although this is a variation of the original Pears with Mint Extract bar available in stores, it still meets its claim as an effective but gentle way to keep skin healthy by sustaining the oil vs water balance in my skin without the use of harsh chemicals found in other anti-bacterial soaps.</li>
            <li>It lathers more than other glycerin soaps and leaves you feeling undeniably clean.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know exactly what it is, but the scent can really relax me.  </li>
            <li>Available locally for 99 cents at dollar stores</li>
            <li>When I saw they had a mint version I was really looking forward to it, and bought a dozen bars.  </li>
            <li>They immediately scrapped the classic formula and made a mass produced soap.</li>
            <li>This particular scent is truly &amp;#34;aroma therapy&amp;#34; for me.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The mint is refreshing but may be too harsh for you face</li>
            <li>clear all the timemy wife thinks it is inferior to beauty shop  </li>
            <li>is you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So now Pears is just a name and has little to do with the original product.</li>
            <li>But still cool none the less.</li>
            <li>By the way it has barely any mint and menthol in it.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> the soap doesnt last very long if youre like me and rubs it all over with the shower running.  </li>

            <li> I know it sounds weird, but I guess it&#x27;s the menthol or spearmint that is calming.</li>
            <li> This was a real disappointment for me.</li>
            <li> When it arrived I was very disappointed: no mint (or eucalyptus)</li>

            <li> Smells more like a cough drop than mint. The menthol is overpowering.</li>
            <li> Loved Pears soap for years.</li>
            <li> Ive known for a while that this wasnt the same Pears soap we all loved. I decided to try it anywyas.  Around 2009 Unilever purchased the Pears brand. They immediately scrapped the classic formula and made a mass produced soap. So now Pears is just a name and has little to do with the original product. This is more like a detergent than a soap. It does clean and it does lather rather well. Thats because of its SLS and other ingredient. By the way it has barely any mint and menthol in it.</li>
            <li> love the soap so iam carrying in my bag3 packs 2 as gifts to friens of course i use only pears  clear all the timemy wife thinks it is inferior to beauty shop  soap but as a seasone doc  i know different cliff</li>
            <li> Great soap. Have been using it for years. Available locally for 99 cents at dollar stores</li>
            <li> Good soap different fragrance</li>
            <li> Smells way more like cheap perfume than like mint and menthol.  I am a big fan of regular Pears soap.  This was a real disappointment for me.</li>
            <li> greatest soap..fresh, clean, suds up enough for shampoo and shaving…mint is very refreshing and cooling on a hot day&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend</li>
            <li> My favorite soap. Lathers well, smells great and not pricey at all.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start with the fact that it&#x27;s in my favorite color-blue!  Just kidding.  It lathers more than other glycerin soaps and leaves you feeling undeniably clean.  Good for the active person, just don&#x27;t keep it somewhere where it&#x27;ll sit in water and disintegrate.</li>
            <li> Have expected to feel the freshness of the mint extract on the skin and the fragrance to linger for a while after the skin is dried, but did not experience any of them like when I used the Mentha soap produced by Bigelow.</li>
            <li> The mint is refreshing but may be too harsh for you face is you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> have been using it for years, great soap for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve liked Pears for years but this &amp;#34;Mint&amp;#34; is &amp;#34;REALLY&amp;#34; strong, almost makes your eyes water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a longtime fan of normal (gold) Pears soap, with its pleasant eucalyptus smell.  When I saw they had a mint version I was really looking forward to it, and bought a dozen bars.  When it arrived I was very disappointed: no mint (or eucalyptus) smell whatsoever, just a pungent soap smell.  When you were a kid, did you ever get your mouth washed out with soap?  That&#x27;s what this smells like.  It is very pretty, but beyond that it is all business: a very effective soap with a harsh industrial smell.</li>
            <li> i love this soap very refreshing and feels good on the skin</li>
            <li> This particular scent is truly &amp;#34;aroma therapy&amp;#34; for me.  I don&#x27;t know exactly what it is, but the scent can really relax me.  In the shower it calms me and out of the shower, just smelling the soap bar brings me calmness.  I know it sounds weird, but I guess it&#x27;s the menthol or spearmint that is calming.</li>
            <li> I had to try this because of the company&#x27;s history.  the soap doesnt last very long if youre like me and rubs it all over with the shower running.  But still cool none the less.</li>
            <li> My husbands favorite soap.  Fresh mint scent, no scummy residue.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love the feel on skins. Smell is great so fresh smelling</li>
            <li> I lookig for it by the two years&lt;br /&gt;In past I bought one set of three and used in my country home.&lt;br /&gt;Left small peace with I carry  out  and hide to not be used by &amp;#34;profans&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;And again on the cottage season I took out to make me happy.&lt;br /&gt;No fragrance comparison to other &amp;#34;pears&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Now I will grab next.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Amazon!.</li>
            <li> Good stuff..... It&#x27;s deliscious..... Wait what</li>
