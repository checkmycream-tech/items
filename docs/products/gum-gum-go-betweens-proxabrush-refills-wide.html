    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent to use after flossing!</li>
            <li>These are the BEST.............</li>
            <li>Excellent value...</li>
            <li>Arrived in perfect condition!</li>
            <li>Very good for cleaning between teeth.  </li>
            <li>Need them - great for what they are....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these for years and they are great for those of us who have the annoyance of getting food stuck between their teeth</li>
            <li>but I am very satisfied with the performance.</li>
            <li>Plus you can make your own mix to add into the water tank for squirting (hydrogen peroxide, salt, denatured alcohol, neem oil, colloidal silver, etc.)</li>
            <li>Otherwise, they do a good job cleaning between teeth provided you&#x27;re using the appropriate size.&lt;br /&gt;Regarding</li>
            <li>How could I decide whether I want to buy this product if I DO NOT know how many brushes is in the package??</li>
            <li>Panasonic Water Flosser EW-DJ10-A cleans better than these &#x27;go between brush&#x27; heads.</li>
            <li>I believe that they work a lot better than floss.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;Fine Tapered\\</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit between my teeth, so</li>
            <li>How can I decide if this product is worth the money if I can&#x27;t determine how many inserts are in the package?  </li>
            <li>Very good but a little pricey</li>
            <li>They were quickly shipped and saved me me a significant amount.</li>
            <li>The wide size works best for me, but some may need a smaller size.</li>
            <li>The price is right and the product is durable and comes well packaged.  </li>
            <li>I like my proxabrush better than the floss that is specially designed for implants, and I think in the long run the proxabrush is cheaper too.</li>
            <li>When it said the size of this was \\&quot;fine tapered\\&quot; (it did not say if it was for \\&quot;tight\\&quot; spaces, or what size it was other than \\&quot;fine tapered\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>They were formerly called fine.</li>
            <li>Yes, they are sold here on Amazon at a fairly reasonable price.</li>
            <li>To do it properly, use a brush head or floss or probe cleaners, etc., only once between the teeth then throw it away, to be safe.</li>
            <li>Only drawback is that you need more than one brush size because of the different gaps between your teeth.</li>
            <li>...except I was hoping the largest brush would be larger cause I have large gaps in my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Just what I needed to properly clear out pocket areas in my gums.  </li>
            <li>These work really well if you have dental implants, especially if you have a fused bridge implant.</li>
            <li>I use them on the end of small forceps to clean areas on electronic boards.</li>
            <li>The only downside is the refills don&#x27;t last too long if you bend them much while thoroughly brushing between teeth.  </li>
            <li>In addition, if there are around six inserts (this number deduced from the other packages of inserts where the number is visable), I don&#x27;t get why these tiny, little bristles would weigh more than half a pound in shipping weight - 9.6 oz, as advertised.  </li>

            <li> Also, I&#x27;m curious why the very same product sold in a six pack is rated five stars, whereas the item sold individually (this one) is rated two stars.  </li>
            <li> They also can be rather harsh on gums if you are not careful and might cause bleeding.</li>

            <li> Too wide for my teeth....</li>
            <li> &quot; did not sound like it&#x27;s for wide, open spaces between your teeth...</li>
            <li> I buy these at Walgreen&#x27;s regularly, but I should have known I could get them online for considerably less than Walgreen&#x27;s typically inflated price of $4.19.  </li>
            <li> I thought these were the wide brushes that I get from my dentist, but they were not!  </li>
            <li> I would like to know where to get the very wide ones that the periodontist has stocked.</li>
            <li> That Panasonic Water Flosser shoots a heavy duty stream of water unlike any other and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Your gums will return the favor in less than a week.</li>
            <li> As was previously mentioned, it can be difficult to get the wide brush inbetween teeth with a very small gap, but they come in three sizes, narrow, medium and wide, so the narrow brush will usually fit between teeth with very small gaps.  </li>
            <li> [...]  this one&#x27;s for tight spaces</li>
            <li> Not sure if there is any other product like it out there</li>
            <li> Worse, if you have gum disease (bacteria), these type of reusable systems can spread bacteria from one area to another.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> When it said the size of this was \\&quot;fine tapered\\&quot; (it did not say if it was for \\&quot;tight\\&quot; spaces, or what size it was other than \\&quot;fine tapered\\&quot;. \\&quot;Fine Tapered\\&quot; did not sound like it&#x27;s for wide, open spaces between your teeth... well, guess what, the size of this is big. It doesn&#x27;t fit between my teeth, so it&#x27;s a waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So just to help anyone else with sizing:&lt;br /&gt;(here&#x27;s the explanation I got from the seller)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, you ordered the 614s, which are now called \\&quot;wide\\&quot; by Butler (see picture below). They were formerly called fine. The product comes three ways - Tight, which is cylindrical, Moderate and Wide, which are both tapered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]  this one&#x27;s for tight spaces</li>
            <li> How can I decide if this product is worth the money if I can&#x27;t determine how many inserts are in the package?  In addition, if there are around six inserts (this number deduced from the other packages of inserts where the number is visable), I don&#x27;t get why these tiny, little bristles would weigh more than half a pound in shipping weight - 9.6 oz, as advertised.  Overpackaging is a big consideration for me - wasted resources.  I don&#x27;t want to support this sort of cluelessness.</li>
            <li> Excellent to use after flossing!</li>
            <li> How could I decide whether I want to buy this product if I DO NOT know how many brushes is in the package?? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I could not tell from the image of the package either?? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Seng Gan</li>
            <li> These work really well if you have dental implants, especially if you have a fused bridge implant. The wide size works best for me, but some may need a smaller size. I like my proxabrush better than the floss that is specially designed for implants, and I think in the long run the proxabrush is cheaper too.</li>
            <li> Very good for cleaning between teeth.  The price is right and the product is durable and comes well packaged.  Hope this was helpful.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to properly clear out pocket areas in my gums.  These were replacement brushes; I already had the dental tool.</li>
            <li> Yes, they are sold here on Amazon at a fairly reasonable price. I use them on the end of small forceps to clean areas on electronic boards. I have found the &#x27;Panasonic Oral Irrigator&#x27; Model No. EW-DJ10  updated to Panasonic Water Flosser EW-DJ10-A cleans better than these &#x27;go between brush&#x27; heads. They also can be rather harsh on gums if you are not careful and might cause bleeding. Worse, if you have gum disease (bacteria), these type of reusable systems can spread bacteria from one area to another. To do it properly, use a brush head or floss or probe cleaners, etc., only once between the teeth then throw it away, to be safe. That Panasonic Water Flosser shoots a heavy duty stream of water unlike any other and gets the job done. Plus you can make your own mix to add into the water tank for squirting (hydrogen peroxide, salt, denatured alcohol, neem oil, colloidal silver, etc.) Then follow up with a Philips Sonicare Rechargeable Electric tooth brushing. I like using the &#x27;Desert Essence&#x27; toothpaste products. Your gums will return the favor in less than a week. If not, go see a periodontist.</li>
            <li> These are the BEST.............I&#x27;m NOT finding them locally anywhere, just the little disposable travel ones. I have the replaceable &amp;#34;wand&amp;#34; type holder in every bathroom, car, motorcycle saddlebags..........with my wide-gapped teeth at the gum line, whomever invented these had me in mind. Think I&#x27;ll stockpile before they decide to stop making them.............</li>
            <li> I thought these were the wide brushes that I get from my dentist, but they were not!  I would like to know where to get the very wide ones that the periodontist has stocked.</li>
            <li> ...except I was hoping the largest brush would be larger cause I have large gaps in my teeth.  But hey are what you would expect and no problems.</li>
            <li> Need them - great for what they are....</li>
            <li> I buy these at Walgreen&#x27;s regularly, but I should have known I could get them online for considerably less than Walgreen&#x27;s typically inflated price of $4.19.  If you work them around well between teeth after you brush and after you eat, they dislodge any particles remaining.  As was previously mentioned, it can be difficult to get the wide brush inbetween teeth with a very small gap, but they come in three sizes, narrow, medium and wide, so the narrow brush will usually fit between teeth with very small gaps.  The only downside is the refills don&#x27;t last too long if you bend them much while thoroughly brushing between teeth.  Otherwise, they do a good job cleaning between teeth provided you&#x27;re using the appropriate size.&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the weight, the 8 oz per item is a typo, it should be .8 oz.  Also, I&#x27;m curious why the very same product sold in a six pack is rated five stars, whereas the item sold individually (this one) is rated two stars.  Here&#x27;s the link to the item rated five stars:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Betweens-Proxabrush-Refills-8-Count-Packages/dp/B000KPKBOA/ref&#x3D;pd_sbs_hpc_1&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, in the future I will be buying them from Amazon, rather than paying 2-3 times as much locally.</li>
            <li> Excellent value...and my dentist tells me I may use these instead of floss! They were quickly shipped and saved me me a significant amount.</li>
            <li> They are what they are.</li>
            <li> Too wide for my teeth....</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by my dentist. Not sure if there is any other product like it out there but I am very satisfied with the performance.</li>
            <li> Arrived in perfect condition!</li>
            <li> Been using these for years. I believe that they work a lot better than floss.  Only drawback is that you need more than one brush size because of the different gaps between your teeth.</li>
            <li> Very good but a little pricey</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years and they are great for those of us who have the annoyance of getting food stuck between their teeth</li>
