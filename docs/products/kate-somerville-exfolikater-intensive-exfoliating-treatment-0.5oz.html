            <li>I also love the scent.</li>

            <li>Exfoliating was a step I skipped more often than I&#x27;d like to admit</li>
            <li>I just had to order some more for myself.</li>
            <li>but there are cheaper drug store products that are better exfoliators.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I loved how smooth and clean it made my skin feel.</li>
            <li>This is a must have if you are using the Kate Somerville DermalQuench Liquid Lift Advanced Wrinkle Treatment.  </li>
            <li>It made my face feel so smooth and</li>
            <li>I got this product as a free sample from Sephora.</li>
            <li>It is even good for really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It works great and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.  </li>
            <li>I got this as a sample from sephora and was surprised how effective it is.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough about how effective the dermal quench is..</li>
            <li>If you are wondering if it is worth the money, it is.</li>
            <li>and it is well worth it</li>
            <li>This product not only smells great, but the sensation on my face as I exfoliate instantly makes my skin feel refreshed/clean.</li>
            <li>However, I noticed that using the Dermal Quench caused blackheads to appear on my nose..something I have not had since high school!!  </li>
            <li>Wow, this has made my skin smooth and has minimized my wrinkles...</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin look soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>but my skin feel soft and smooth after every use.</li>
            <li>I have struggled with acne for a decade (anywhere from mild to cystic) &amp; I have to say this is by far</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>After using this it really irritated my skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend NeedCrystals Microdermabrasion Crystals over this.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Skin is very soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>Having had such sensitive skin throughout my adolescence as well as adulthood, I am very concerned with what products I use on my face.</li>
            <li>I am 54 years old...</li>
            <li>how well it works for young women but</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>This leaves my skin feeling soft without the irritation</li>
            <li>My face feels so refresh and soft after using this scrub..</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and my skin feels so soft and clean after use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually buy expensive make-up or soap, but I go this as a sample and loved it so much I bought it and will use it regularly.  </li>
            <li>I was not sure if this was worth the price.</li>

            <li> Its a pricey duo, but a little goes a long way..and think how much you have spent on stuff that did not work!</li>
            <li> but I was surprised the bottle was so small especially considering the price</li>
            <li> The next morning is my favorite part of this process because I adore the way it makes my s***ty, badly scarred face look.</li>

            <li> I did some research on the ingredients and a lot of what&#x27;s in it is not good for your skin, especially sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> for those with dry skin, I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Literally I have gone to bed almost in tears because of how poor my complexion looks without makeup &amp; (thanks to this product)</li>
            <li> I typically use grainy scrubs to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> I use it a few times a week.</li>
            <li> so not sure</li>
            <li> I ordered the small one to try it out.</li>
            <li> Not sure what that is</li>
            <li> Hardly any abrasion and there isn&#x27;t anything &amp;#34;intensive&amp;#34; about it</li>
            <li> and I buy the small tube because this product is expensive.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Product was as advertised.</li>
            <li> Best exfoliant I have used at home. Skin is very soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> This is a must have if you are using the Kate Somerville DermalQuench Liquid Lift Advanced Wrinkle Treatment.  I cannot say enough about how effective the dermal quench is..honestly I&#x27;m 67 and the difference was amazing.  However, I noticed that using the Dermal Quench caused blackheads to appear on my nose..something I have not had since high school!!  But doing a weekly scrub with the ExfoliKate took care of the clogged pores.  Its a pricey duo, but a little goes a long way..and think how much you have spent on stuff that did not work!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product and I buy the small tube because this product is expensive. But I get it anyway I can afford it. a MUST HAVE for beautiful skin. If you want to see your face glow, try this.</li>
            <li> very good service, will buy again</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I use it a few times a week. A little goes a long way and my skin feels so soft and clean after use.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  I use it twice a week and it works better than any exfoliating product I have tried.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. I don&#x27;t usually buy expensive make-up or soap, but I go this as a sample and loved it so much I bought it and will use it regularly.  It made my face feel so smooth and anytime I feel a blemish coming on, I use it an it prevents it. I am 54 years old... so not sure how well it works for young women but for those with dry skin, I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Love Kate Somerville.  It works great and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.  If you are wondering if it is worth the money, it is.</li>
            <li> This is the weakest exfoliater I have ever tried.  Hardly any abrasion and there isn&#x27;t anything &amp;#34;intensive&amp;#34; about it; it didn&#x27;t do a thing to my skin.  I think you end up paying for the designer brand rather than the quality of the product.  I highly recommend NeedCrystals Microdermabrasion Crystals over this.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. It makes my skin feel so soft and refreshed. I also love the scent. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This leaves my skin feeling soft without the irritation</li>
            <li> When my gorgeous 70 y/o aunt told me that she used it I thought I should try it.  Wow, this has made my skin smooth and has minimized my wrinkles... I will never go without this stuff!!</li>
            <li> I have struggled with acne for a decade (anywhere from mild to cystic) &amp; I have to say this is by far my most favorite product I have EVER used. Having had such sensitive skin throughout my adolescence as well as adulthood, I am very concerned with what products I use on my face. Exfoliating was a step I skipped more often than I&#x27;d like to admit, I never learned that it is a crucial part of cleansing the face.  This product not only smells great, but the sensation on my face as I exfoliate instantly makes my skin feel refreshed/clean. I wish I could use this every night! The next morning is my favorite part of this process because I adore the way it makes my s***ty, badly scarred face look. Literally I have gone to bed almost in tears because of how poor my complexion looks without makeup &amp; (thanks to this product) woken up to a drastically different face looking back at me in the mirror, one that feels softer &amp; gives me hope that I can one day walk outside without loads of makeup.</li>
            <li> great stuff.......................cleans out those pores....makes my face feel SOOOO CLEAN.......i use it about 3 x a week and it is well worth it</li>
            <li> I love exfolikate! My cousin had given me a sample of it a while back and I loved how smooth and clean it made my skin feel. I just had to order some more for myself. It is even good for really sensitive skin. It won&#x27;t burn your skin or dry it out. Definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> I was not sure if this was worth the price. My daughter loves it and suggested I order it. I ordered the small one to try it out. It is excellent! Can see a difference in my skin. I am 63!</li>
            <li> Great product! It does exactly what it says it does. I will be buying more!! It also came in the mail well packaged.</li>
            <li> I got this as a sample from sephora and was surprised how effective it is. I typically use grainy scrubs to exfoliate. I now have switched over to this product 1-2x per week. Makes your skin look soft and smooth. Great product!</li>
            <li> My face feels so refresh and soft after using this scrub.. a bit pricey, but  I love it, love it, love it!!!</li>
            <li> After using this it really irritated my skin. I did some research on the ingredients and a lot of what&#x27;s in it is not good for your skin, especially sensitive skin. Don&#x27;t buy this! I thought it would be a good product but there are cheaper drug store products that are better exfoliators.</li>
            <li> I got this product as a free sample from Sephora. It made my skin feel very smooth after rinsing it off, but it felt like it was burning my skin when it was on. It didn&#x27;t smell great either and it looked and felt like mud. I wouldn&#x27;t ever actually buy this product.</li>
            <li> great product but I was surprised the bottle was so small especially considering the price</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It does a great job of exfoliating and I like the tingling sensation.  Not sure what that is but my skin feel soft and smooth after every use.</li>
            <li> Got it for my mom. She loves this product.</li>
            <li> Great product and service.</li>
