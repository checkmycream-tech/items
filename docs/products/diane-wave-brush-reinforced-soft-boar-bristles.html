    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>If it remains durable, I would happily buy this product again.</li>
            <li>This is a great hairbrush.</li>
            <li>but I am happy with it regardless.</li>
            <li>The brush in question was as good as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>was good for it, so</li>
            <li>It would make a good pet brush.</li>
            <li>Feels good.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping, great product!!</li>
            <li>The brush i received is a nice a$$ brush.</li>
            <li>But in all..what i got is still a nice brush.</li>
            <li>And the value is spectacular.</li>
            <li>Bristles nice.</li>
            <li>This brush is mostly nylon bristles enforcing a scarce amount of boar bristles, but whatever.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good cheap, quick solution.</li>
            <li>This brush was pretty good.</li>
            <li>but the key of using this brush is let the brush set on its bristle in some hot water for 5mins &amp; the brush soften to the best brush ever.</li>
            <li>I know that I probably should have invested more money and gotten a better brush if I wanted better results, but I just wanted something short term.</li>
            <li>The bristles are good and stiff, so it goes through my long, waist length, fine hair easily and without pulling.</li>
            <li>I saw a difference in my hair after the first use.</li>
            <li>i use this brush to start my session, i allow the brush soak in hot to warm water, while i apply a deep condition &amp; shower cap 30mins prior to brushing with my warm wet brush, it becomes the softy &amp; the medium</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight,which is good for a avid brusher and serious waver.</li>
            <li>i got this because i was hoping that a boar brush would not ruin my chance of curling my hair by separating the pieces too much.</li>
            <li>so thankfully I didn&#x27;t pay too much.</li>
            <li>It kinda just spreads the oil at the top of the head and redistributes some to the end of the hair, but makes it look very flat on your head, especially if you are in the process of going no &#x27;poo or water washing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, and not overly large or too small.  </li>
            <li>Very course, much stiffer then expected.</li>
            <li>I would not call them soft bristles though.</li>
            <li>#9007 Diane Wave Brush, Reinforced Soft Boar Bristles.</li>
            <li>There is nothing soft about this brush.</li>
            <li>If they call it soft</li>
            <li>The ends of my hair are definitely less dry than they were before, but it&#x27;s not a completely even distribution from top to bottom.</li>
            <li>There are some soft bristles mixed in with the stiffer nylon bristles.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I ordered red and got black.</li>
            <li>The bristles are appropriately stiff, enough to brush my hair and scalp the right way.</li>

            <li> The bristles are appropriately stiff, enough to brush my hair and scalp the right way.</li>
            <li> This brush SUCKS first</li>
            <li> and i can barely get it through my hair if it is wet or if it has an tangles in it.</li>
            <li> The color was NOT red as shown, nor were the bristles SOFT, they were very stiff.  </li>
            <li> Second, the bristles are so hard as if they are wall nails (and it does says soft bristles on the package).</li>
            <li> Even though it says soft bristles, they seem very harsh to me and the brush does not go through my hair like I would like it to.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting a black brush, but got red instead.  </li>
            <li> Expected black but received red.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t care until I found out how hard the bristle are they are suppose to be soft</li>
            <li> I ordered red and got green</li>
            <li> It was a lot harder than expected</li>
            <li> It was a little larger than I had anticipated, but it is still extremely workable.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s functional.</li>
            <li> Not a big deal, at least not to me.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this brush in order to distribute the oils in my hair all the way down my hair shaft.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just as hard as the Diane Palm Brush with extra firm reinforced boar bristles.</li>
            <li> they are not soft at all and would do well on thick hair as well.</li>
            <li> wit dis brush DONT WASTE UR MONEY ON THIS</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money with this one.</li>
            <li> I wonder how firm feels....</li>
            <li> not soft very hard but gets the job done</li>
            <li> I baught this for a beard brush, but it is much to stiff and scratches the skin pretty badly.</li>
            <li> It is very, very stiff.</li>
            <li> What i got was a green very hard reinforced bristle brush.</li>
            <li> The quality is bad and it is NOT soft at all.</li>
            <li> it is just what i was looking for, the brush is kinda hard tho, but ill just get used to it, the brush came in under a week&lt;</li>
            <li> But it was the wrong brush.</li>
            <li> Disappointed by this purchase.  </li>
            <li> but I am disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> This brush is crap.</li>

            <li> not soft very hard but gets the job done</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, great product!!</li>
            <li> Apparently, it only comes in gaudy lipstick red now. Other than that, it&#x27;s functional.</li>
            <li> The bristles are appropriately stiff, enough to brush my hair and scalp the right way. There are some soft bristles mixed in with the stiffer nylon bristles.  The handle is wood, so we&#x27;ll see how the brush holds up after a couple of cleanings.  It&#x27;s light, and not overly large or too small.  I was expecting a black brush, but got red instead.  Going back I see they say assorted colors in the description, which I guess means their choice of color.  Not a big deal, at least not to me.  If it remains durable, I would happily buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This brush SUCKS first I ordered red and got green but I didn&#x27;t care until I found out how hard the bristle are they are suppose to be soft I can&#x27;t even brush my hair wit dis brush DONT WASTE UR MONEY ON THIS</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve order like three different colors &amp; got all blue! but the key of using this brush is let the brush set on its bristle in some hot water for 5mins &amp; the brush soften to the best brush ever. i use this brush to start my session, i allow the brush soak in hot to warm water, while i apply a deep condition &amp; shower cap 30mins prior to brushing with my warm wet brush, it becomes the softy &amp; the medium all @ one time!</li>
            <li> Disappointed by this purchase.  The color was NOT red as shown, nor were the bristles SOFT, they were very stiff.  Even though it was an add-on item, the price was not that low so I would expect to receive what was represented and even the color.</li>
            <li> The brush i received is a nice a$$ brush. But it was the wrong brush. It wasn&#x27;t red and it&#x27;s just as hard as the Diane Palm Brush with extra firm reinforced boar bristles. What i got was a green very hard reinforced bristle brush. I knew by the posts of others that I probably wouldn&#x27;t get the brush I ordered. But in all..what i got is still a nice brush.</li>
            <li> i got this because i was hoping that a boar brush would not ruin my chance of curling my hair by separating the pieces too much. no such luck. and i can barely get it through my hair if it is wet or if it has an tangles in it.</li>
            <li> The brush that you see in the picture is not what you get in the mail. But a brush is a brush and it works.</li>
            <li> This brush is crap. The quality is bad and it is NOT soft at all. It was an add on item so thankfully I didn&#x27;t pay too much. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money with this one.</li>
            <li> The brush in question was as good as I had hoped. It was a little larger than I had anticipated, but it is still extremely workable. Thank you for your assistance in acquiring said brush.</li>
            <li> I had just read that brushing your hair one hundred times (just like your mother told you!) was good for it, so I thought I would give it a try.  They recommended a brush with Boar bristles.  I was used to the Fuller Brush Company brushes I used back in the 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s.  This is not them.  Even though it says soft bristles, they seem very harsh to me and the brush does not go through my hair like I would like it to.  Maybe I&#x27;m just not used to it but I am disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> This is a great hairbrush. The bristles are good and stiff, so it goes through my long, waist length, fine hair easily and without pulling. And the value is spectacular. Where else can you get a boar bristle brush for $4. I would not call them soft bristles though. they are not soft at all and would do well on thick hair as well.</li>
            <li> #9007 Diane Wave Brush, Reinforced Soft Boar Bristles. There is nothing soft about this brush. It is very, very stiff.</li>
            <li> This brush was pretty good.It was a lot harder than expected but it did say \\&quot;reinforced\\&quot; but I am happy with it regardless. I saw a difference in my hair after the first use. It is very lightweight,which is good for a avid brusher and serious waver. I recommend this brush to any waver but it is firm/hard.</li>
            <li> First of all, I ordered red and got black. Second, the bristles are so hard as if they are wall nails (and it does says soft bristles on the package). If they call it soft I wonder how firm feels....</li>
            <li> Very course, much stiffer then expected. I baught this for a beard brush, but it is much to stiff and scratches the skin pretty badly. It would make a good pet brush.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush in order to distribute the oils in my hair all the way down my hair shaft. I know that I probably should have invested more money and gotten a better brush if I wanted better results, but I just wanted something short term. This brush is mostly nylon bristles enforcing a scarce amount of boar bristles, but whatever. It kinda just spreads the oil at the top of the head and redistributes some to the end of the hair, but makes it look very flat on your head, especially if you are in the process of going no &#x27;poo or water washing. If I brush my hair and then kinda shake it out, it helps. The ends of my hair are definitely less dry than they were before, but it&#x27;s not a completely even distribution from top to bottom. It&#x27;s a good cheap, quick solution.</li>
            <li> it is just what i was looking for, the brush is kinda hard tho, but ill just get used to it, the brush came in under a week&lt;br /&gt;i recommend it to all the wave community</li>
            <li> Expected black but received red. Bristles nice. Feels good.</li>
