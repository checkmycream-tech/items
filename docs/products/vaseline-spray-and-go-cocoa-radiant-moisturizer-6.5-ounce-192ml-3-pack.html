            <li>It&#x27;s perfect to take along when traveling because of the way the spray nob closes to insure that the moisturizer does not leak out.</li>

            <li>just run under warm water</li>

            <li>It also has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>I have to be honest here...</li>
            <li>so you can put your clothes inmediately, the nice cocoa smell is so nice.</li>

            <li>Im in love with the new spray and go!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall i am pretty happy with this product will definitely be re</li>

            <li>Sweet, cocoa butter smell that stays with you throughout the day.</li>

            <li>The scent is nice too, it is soft and buttery.</li>
            <li>love how i can feel my skin absorbing this spray on lotion as soon as it is applied.</li>
            <li>This product is a perfect secondary moisturizer, in addition to a heavier type overnight.  </li>
            <li>The size is not bad and I&#x27;ve been using for a month and still have plenty.</li>
            <li>Very fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Love it because it&#x27;s easy and not messy at all.  </li>
            <li>Love the scent its soft and its not oily its easy to spray on and go like it promotes no lie there.</li>
            <li>I never used lotion because of the effort of applying,  but this is so easy i can even spray it onto my own back.  </li>
            <li>other than that it is a great product.</li>
            <li>Love how convenient it is in the new design spray and go!</li>
            <li>I just did a quick rub, and my skin drank it up.</li>
            <li>The lotion is not greasy and quick drying.</li>
            <li>The spray allows me to cover more body areas more quickly, which is helpful since I&#x27;m always in such a rush.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I received one from the influenster program to try out.</li>
            <li>I can get an even spray quickly.</li>
            <li>It dries in seconds and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or grease behind, just smooth radiant skin with an awesome scent (reminds me of tanning products, not the chemical smelling ones but rather coconutty).</li>
            <li>and it drys quickly.</li>
            <li>The applicator it is convenient when in a rush to get ready, and my husband and I love it, is fun to apply moisturizer like that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even when taking the time to rub it in it dries fairly quick.  </li>
            <li>It is thinner, spreads evenly by spraying, and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this one in particular when I put it on</li>
            <li>I love the Vaseline Spray and Go mainly because I feel like I am always in a hurry to get somewhere</li>
            <li>Well, it is quick and convenient.</li>
            <li>This one in particular smells like suntan lotion to me and that I love the beachy smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It dries really quick</li>
            <li>Oh oh, I really don&#x27;t wear this type of product, but I do trust the brand, so far so good for me, so I gave it a go.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly but results are nothing that would make me run out and buy again.</li>
            <li>its fast &amp; easy to apply.. a little messy but, its still a great product &amp; leaves skin feeling amazing!!</li>
            <li>I also love the shape and design of the bottle because it gives it a high end look.</li>
            <li>It sprays on a pretty light coat</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always rushing and the thing that always slows me down is apply lotion to my body, so this product is great for that.</li>
            <li>It makes application super easy and fast.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin with a natural glow that i love cause it does not look greasy as other body spray do!&lt;br /&gt;Great price, great product.</li>
            <li>and I really like how easy it is to evenly apply the lotion.</li>
            <li>This is easy to apply and fast.</li>
            <li>his product is fast and easy.</li>
            <li>This product is so fast and easy to put on that im always putting on lotion.</li>
            <li>This is so fast and easy to use in the morning.</li>
            <li>I absolutely fell in love with this the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and absorbs fast, just like it says.</li>
            <li>But, for how quickly it works, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and absorbs fast, just like it says.</li>
            <li>Its really easy to use and fast.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing this soon after I run out of the current one, price wise it pretty affordable too.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to face the day!!</li>
            <li>So I tried this product and it was exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>If only it came in some fun, tropical, summer scents, I would like it even more!</li>
            <li>I loved the convenience and nice smell of this product, but it was not moisturizing enough for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>This product spray on nicely and is very light weight lotion that isn&#x27;t greasy or messy.</li>
            <li>I love the simplicity of a no mess no fuss lotion application!</li>
            <li>Specially if you are on the run ;)</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really worth $5 for this spray product versus a product that you have to pump out yourself and requires a little bit more time to rub into your skin.</li>
            <li>This products not only smells amazing-</li>
            <li>I tried all the scents and this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice, but the scent doesn&#x27;t last so it doesn&#x27;t clash with your perfume.</li>
            <li>this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually fun to use also.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li>It is immediately absorbed by the skin.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy, as far as smooth, my skin has been progressing!</li>
            <li>Honestly, you can spray and go just like the commercial.</li>
            <li>I receive Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer Cocoa Radiant complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster.  </li>
            <li>It seems the money would be better spent if the times you are able to use it would increase a tad bit.</li>
            <li>Ty InfluensterVox for my complimentary can.</li>
            <li>The spray promises leaving your skin “feeling healthy and glowing” and also after the application your skin will feel “instantly soft, not sticky or greasy“.  </li>
            <li>product is complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes</li>
            <li>That was fun.....</li>
            <li>With the brands I had been using, I would have to wait until my skin absorbed what it could and then wipe off any residue before getting dressed.</li>
            <li>It is well worth six bucks to try it.</li>
            <li>i love how soft leave my skin</li>
            <li>I received the cocoa butter scented bottle complimentary from Influenster</li>
            <li>I received this Vaseline product complimentary from Influenster in the viva voxbox.</li>
            <li>I always forget to buy one, but when I received this product from Influenster as a complimentary product for testing purposes</li>
            <li>What easier way to use this product, love it and will continue using it leaves my skin fresh and soft.</li>
            <li>I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes from influenster</li>
            <li>My favorite feature of this product is that it doesn&#x27;t give my skin that oily/greasy feeling and my second favorite feature is the lock and open twist top.</li>
            <li>Its amazing for last minute as your walking out the door super fast!</li>
            <li>Great scent, not strong.</li>
            <li>True to its claims, it is non-greasy, fast absorbing, and the spray is a smooth continuous flow.</li>
            <li>Other than that I think is a good product to buy...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s aboslutely perfect after a quick shower at the gym or when you need a little extra moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I like the convenience of the spray as opposed to guessing the right amount of lotion to spread on your body.  </li>
            <li>It puts out just the right amount of spray as isn&#x27;t greasy at all.</li>
            <li>I received it right away.</li>
            <li>I like to moisturize right out of the shower.</li>
            <li>I can just put my clothes right on.</li>
            <li>soaks right into the skin.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t you can take a shower spray lotion rub it in get dress right after wards.</li>
            <li>Just a slight pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>It is quick to dry, it smells great, does not mess up your clothes, and its not expensive.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, fantastic product and highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The lotion gets absorbed super fast so you can get dressed right</li>
            <li>that said, I would recommend it for people with normal skin, if you have very dry skin or are looking for a creamy or oily moisturizer, this is not for you, since it does absorb quickly but it does moisturize well enough and, again, it smells delicious!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think there are any unique active ingredients making the formula any more &#x27;age defying&#x27; than other creams and lotions, however, it&#x27;s so convenient and pleasant to use that I&#x27;m moisturizing more frequently, hence, softer, smoother skin.</li>
            <li>It sprayed on easily and left your skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>this cream is very practical, it is literary as easy as spray and go no need to let it dry because it dries quickly; not only does it have a wonderful smell but it also keeps the skin hydrated.</li>
            <li>It is an easy spray, it appears a bit thin and liquify but smells great</li>
            <li>It is great to use when your in a hurry, which is usually my case.</li>
            <li>They also think is fun to get sprayed they find it funny.</li>
            <li>so easy with no mess!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised at all the reviews that the fragrance was too strong because they weren&#x27;t to me.</li>
            <li>This spray moisturized my skin, soaked into the skin super fast and lasted all day.</li>
            <li>This sprays on a gentle lotion mist, you wipe it quickly and you&#x27;re off.</li>
            <li>wow really i loved this product&lt;br /&gt;its spray &amp; cream at the same time !</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how quick this really works.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the this product it really is a fast, easy, all day moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I  tried this product a little while ago and loved it from the get go, it&#x27;s a spray on, light, non greasy and fast absorbing</li>
            <li>The trick with this is to hold it back and just very lightly mist yourself.  </li>
            <li>I trueally love this lotion because it is so silky smooth its not a blob like the other lotions.</li>
            <li>The thing that i love about this lotion is that its quick to dry.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy and dries super quick.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>I like how it leaves my skin so soft, smooth hydrated and radiant looking and doesn&#x27;t leave</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d fallen in love with spray sunscreen for the same reason.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only giving it 4 out of 5 stars because I wish they had more scents.</li>
            <li>I put it on more often then regular lotion.</li>
            <li>Overall, however, I love mine and the smell,</li>
            <li>I always wondered about it but did not want to spend the money on something i wasnt sure it would actually work.</li>
            <li>skin is so soft and smooth when I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>Love the smell, Summer is definitely here.</li>
            <li>My husband was hesitant to use it at first</li>
            <li>he said it left his skin feeling oily and he didn&#x27;t like it but ended up using it more than me.  </li>
            <li>I recommend trying it could possibly work for you! :)</li>
            <li>really helps!</li>
            <li>#34;How can a lotion spray on and still moisturize?&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an avid lotion user and I make it a point to moisturize every day.  </li>
            <li>I actually think it helped me legs look better then before.</li>
            <li>Definitely feel Vaseline outdid themselves on this one. &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>;-)  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes for the better, so I probably wont repurchase and stick to the extra minute</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely going to buy more when my can runs out.</li>
            <li>&#x27;m an avid lotion user and</li>
            <li>I tried this product which I love that I can keep in my car or big purse.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it is supposed to do- sprays moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to love to carry in my beach bag after the beach wish they had a smaller one to carry in my bag</li>
            <li>You spray and lightly rub in and your skin feels soft and well...</li>
            <li>Have the many of these bottles at home in different scents and my loves them!!</li>
            <li>However, I think that if you need to be aware to spray this one you in an area where it will not get on any of your clothing or w/ out anyone standing by you, so that it does land on them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non-greasy, soft when applied, leaving your skin feeling smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li>and my skin is so much happier with me!  </li>
            <li>I would say I love the product based on convenience alone, as the spray on quality makes it not only easy to apply but also fun, so you never forget to apply your daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light enough that it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling after it is rubbed in.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have much of a smell (to me) and it dries quickly, so</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use, leaves skin so soft yet not oily,  dries fast</li>
            <li>Vaseline has so stepped up and created a lotion that is fast and easy for people with busy on the go lifestyles.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the fact that you just spray, smooth it out a little, and you&#x27;re ready to go!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this for people for travel often, don&#x27;t have much time when getting ready to moisturize and for anyone who loves smelling good and feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I tried it for a week straight and at first I liked it; but as I went on using it, it&#x27;s not really moisturizing at all.</li>
            <li>Especially good for moisturizing the back and hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li>This spray on is a very fine mist, and colorless unless you linger on a certain spot for a long time.</li>
            <li>After I&#x27;ve just taken a shower I use my Spray and Go Coco radiant, it not only smells great but really helps with my dry skin.</li>
            <li>and I personally have enjoyed it.i really like the smell.its</li>
            <li>So first thing&#x27;s first, I really did like the concept of this product-</li>
            <li>Very, very helpful and a much needed feature.</li>
            <li>Overall it gives plenty of moisture, but I don&#x27;t really have very good hand control, so I feel like I wasted a lot of the product by accidentally over spraying myself.</li>
            <li>I pretty much use unscented products because I don&#x27; t like smelling like a walking perfume counter.  </li>
            <li>A soft non-greasy formula designed to go on smooth while giving you a lasting smooth finish without that greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>At first I though I might be putting too much on, but the quantity didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference.</li>
            <li>but im willing to spend the money because this product really works for me and my family.</li>
            <li>This is product was surprisingly good, I usually don&#x27;t wear lotion because I don&#x27;t have time</li>
            <li>I also expected the spray and go moisturizer to be exactly that; however, I have to rub it in because it lays in greasy pools on top of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I tried this out and it was easy to put on and a couple of rubs and my legs were not longer related to alligator skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to use especially if your always on the go.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quick and leaves skin so soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy especially when you&#x27;re on the go.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and leaves skin soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so simple and easy to use</li>
            <li>Vaseline Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer in Pure Cocoa Butter.</li>
            <li>I certainly recommend giving a whirl.</li>
            <li>The manufacturer has forgotten about a large segment of the population.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t help spraying a large plume of product into the air.</li>
            <li>Bought it because I thought it would be easy to spray on my back, which gets really itchy in the winter.  </li>
            <li>dries super fast and leaves your skin soft an refreshed.</li>
            <li>I definitely love this for traveling and hard to reach places where I can spray a quick layer!</li>
            <li>Interested in trying the other ones out :)</li>
            <li>My main issue was that, brrrr!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also really easy to spray on, sprays upside down and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was nice to use in hard to reach places and my skin felt immediately soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>If you are in a hurry, it is much faster to apply.</li>
            <li>It is a very convenient way to get moisturizer when you won&#x27;t take the time to rub in lotion after a shower.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really convenient to spray over your body and it moisture well</li>
            <li>Too much hassle.  </li>
            <li>fast</li>
            <li>I got the #sprayandgo vaseline lotion from @influenster for free in my #vivavoxbox to try and I have to say it is a definite must buy.</li>
            <li>and they really don&#x27;t like lotion</li>
            <li>i am very grateful that influenster &amp; Vaseline  provided this product and hopefully my family</li>
            <li>really like it for Summer/Spring</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m still and work I reapply and ready for the night life.</li>
            <li>and the whole process</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just so much faster</li>
            <li>do need to be cautious because while you are applying it, quite of it ends up on the floor making it really slippery.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am ready to get dressed.</li>
            <li>And let me tell you it really works as is advertised.</li>
            <li>This is really convenient.</li>
            <li>This product is very convenient when your in a hurry to leave...</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is very convenient.</li>
            <li>Goes on very smootly</li>
            <li>Thanks to Influenster</li>
            <li>This lotion is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Kinda pricey for the amount you get, seems like the bottle gets used up fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier than having to rub lotion on.</li>
            <li>I will never find myself without this product and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>You still have to rub on the product to your body, hence, the hands free approach is not the actual reason.  </li>
            <li>it is fast and non sticky 😘</li>
            <li>It works very well and all day  .</li>
            <li>The brown one dries out the skin too much.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Kinda pricey for the amount you get, seems like the bottle gets used up fast.</li>
            <li>The spray and go moisturizer is very convenient for anyone that is in a hurry.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s enough to enjoy.</li>
            <li>You can find this at really any drugstore.</li>
            <li>It also doesnt moisturize very well...</li>
            <li>I can imagine if you use way too much it might be sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>im always on a hurry that means that i don&#x27;t have so much time to apply product thanks to influenster</li>
            <li>I recently tried this product when it was sent to me by #Influenster for free.</li>
            <li>and you are ready to go.</li>
            <li>This product has really changed how i view moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light enough that I can get dressed soon after, but it does help add moisture.  </li>
            <li>So fast to apply.  </li>
            <li>I tried the product and it was very watery.</li>
            <li>But let&#x27;s be honest: using lotion is MESSY.</li>
            <li>I was able to try it recently and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never go back to the old fashion lotion :)</li>
            <li>Good for the summer, but in the cold of winter you will need something more</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you have dry skin, but it&#x27;s ok for normal skin.</li>
            <li>I apply it right after the shower &amp; my skin feels soft all day.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>super easy to use.i especially use it for my back since I cant reach there</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy and cuts your time in half!</li>
            <li>great stuff, especially when you are lazy to put lotion on.</li>
            <li>However, it actually gets absorbed quickly into your body and leaves your skin soft and radiant.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice alternative for people who are running a little bit or are just a little more sluggish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like this product because it is so easy to use especially when you&#x27;re in a rush and busy doing things.</li>
            <li>It was nice being moisturized without feeling slick.</li>
            <li>I really like the idea of this, as I normally skip lotion because its time consuming</li>
            <li>Before receiving this from Influenster for reviewing purposes, I would skip on moisturizer because honestly I am a bit lazy</li>
            <li>I was so amazed when I first tried it  leaves your skin feeling soft and moisturized</li>
            <li>After I towel dry in the shower, I spray my back easily and rest of my body quickly rub it into my skin.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you put a towel down before you spray</li>
            <li>it does dry quick and feels like the creamy baby oil after it dries some loitions leaves you sticky feeling after you get hot.</li>
            <li>The tops of my legs are dry (almost scaley) during the winter months and since purchasing this product, I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference.</li>
            <li>works better than the previous lotion I was using.</li>
            <li>, I get more for less in a lotion rather than spray, and #3</li>
            <li>but I do feel that it is way too light for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>One quick spray will be enough moisture.</li>
            <li>Its simple and quick to apply.</li>
            <li>Especially with mw being pregnant and trying to bend over to reach my legs.</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase more in the future!</li>
            <li>I purchased all three of theses sprays (currently using this one) and I love it as well as the yellow can.</li>
            <li>Body lotion application is time consuming, particularly to an already hectic schedule.</li>
            <li>so i can get a layer around my body and rub it in quickly while my pores are all open.</li>
            <li>It claims to be \\&quot;fast absorbing\\&quot;, which it is, however, it all really depends on how far away from your skin you spray.</li>
            <li>I quickly spray, rub, and instantly feel moisturized!</li>
            <li>It absorbs so quickly and is not greasy at all, which is usually a big concern for me.</li>
            <li>I love because I put it on when I&#x27;m in a rush to go out without the mess of lotion.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend</li>
            <li>This is highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I need heavier moisturizer due to extremely dry skin, but for everyday spray it on, smooth it in and go, this stuff is very nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not messy and it&#x27;s works!!</li>
            <li>Definitely would recommend to friends and now I&#x27;m n avid moisturizer!</li>
            <li>THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT LESS MESS</li>
            <li>I gave this to my 12 year old because she would use too much of my bottled lotion</li>
            <li>So much for shaving 20 seconds off my morning routine- I&#x27;ll stick with the old fashioned lotion pumps.</li>
            <li>I have two young children and this product makes my mornings so much easier.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know HOW many bottles of lotion I&#x27;ve wasted over the years.</li>
            <li>There are a few things I enjoyed about this Vaseline Spray and Go Moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Bottom line be aware of the application process, but it really is so much quicker than traditional application!!  </li>
            <li>This is really fast and easy although for winter I had to use something a little heavier for my elbows and feet.</li>
            <li>I used this on my little one after bath time, it was fast and easy.</li>
            <li>The lotion is not at all greasy and absorbs into your skin quickly allowing you to put clothes on right away-no mess and</li>
            <li>because #1 hubby and I use same lotion and this wouldn&#x27;t last more than a week if not less.</li>
            <li>It feels amazing...and the best part is the ease by which it can be applied to the back and other hard to reach areas of the body.</li>
            <li>In spite of my less than spectacular reception, I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>The lotion itself is ok for regular skin, does not help really dry winter skin.</li>
            <li>Trying to have a 2yr old to hold still can be hard and this makes it quick and easy for me.</li>
            <li>but now I keep this right outside of the shower, spray it on and rub</li>
            <li>I started to try all the new products and came across the Vaseline Spray and Go. . .</li>
            <li>I live in sunny California</li>
            <li>I live in Florida, so that may be the issue.</li>
            <li>I like this new product that Vaseline has come up with since spreading cream all over your body</li>
            <li>It really does dry fast and does not take much rubbing in at all.</li>
            <li>the only problem is this goes super fast will last about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>#sprayandGo @influenster @vaselinebrand received this one free but will definitely be buying the next one!</li>
            <li>It is supper quick to dry and almost has a consistency closer to perfume than lotion in thickness.</li>
            <li>Its very easy to rub into your skin, takes less than a minute to moisturize your entire body.</li>
            <li>I actually burned my skin by mistake under a 12 mid day sun and got an ugly tan mark, my doctor friend recommended me to apply moisturizer and guess what, it have been so handy to have this spray to go, AMAZING!</li>
            <li>and i have a very sensitive nose.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this product didn&#x27;t cause any rash or irritation.  </li>
            <li>My first thought is this is such a gimmick</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says you get an instant mist of lotion</li>
            <li>but my skin is soft and not ashy at all!</li>
            <li>I recently tried the 2 other ones and I have to say this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that it can be a bit sticky at first.</li>
            <li>The scent is exactly the same as its squeeze bottle counterpart.</li>
            <li>skin feels so soft!</li>
            <li>i like the way that the spray feels on my skin and love the fact that i don&#x27;t have to wait a long time for it to dry!</li>
            <li>It does absorb into skin very quickly and eases the discomfort of dry skin to some degree, although it&#x27;s not up there with something like Eucerin, which is basically white axle grease..</li>
            <li>It does have a strong coco butter/vanilla scent, so be wary if you don&#x27;t like strong smells.</li>
            <li>Also, not to mention it is amazing for those hard to reach places, just Spray &amp; Go!</li>
            <li>Special A+ due to it</li>
            <li>I live in southern Texas where it&#x27;s very humid.</li>
            <li>I use it in the shower stall right after I dry off, so I don&#x27;t get it on the bathroom floor.</li>
            <li>It dries super fast and doesn&#x27;t leave that thick heavy feeling most moisturizers.</li>
            <li>My only concern, and this is more personal preference than an actual complaint, is that it feels like it runs out very quickly.</li>
            <li>It did an ok job , you are getting convenience of a spray  but contents of bottle compared to similar lotion not worth it !</li>
            <li>If you spray it far away enough from your body, you really don&#x27;t need to rub it in.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft after using</li>
            <li>My skin is extremely soft after using this product.</li>
            <li>I always forget to use lotion because I&#x27;m in such a hurry every morning to get ready.  </li>
            <li>so when I explained to him how it was used he was surprised.</li>
            <li>it squirts out evenly on your skin and leaves your skin glowing and soft.</li>
            <li>so when I sprayed this product my elbows became instantly soft.</li>
            <li>The only downside to the product is that if you spray it on over a tile floor, it gets really slippery.</li>
            <li>I like how it leaves my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>just soft dries like creamy baby oil.</li>
            <li>If you spray further away, it&#x27;ll soak in a whole lot faster</li>
            <li>I had my 11 year old son try it</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to everyone, it&#x27;s not heavy nor does it get sticky.</li>
            <li>Ladies, put on your big girl panties and use real lotion.</li>
            <li>So far I like it.</li>
            <li>I recommend for normal skin maybe not so much for dry skin.</li>
            <li>It allows me to moisturize my back and dry quickly</li>
            <li>oh so soft!&lt;br /&gt;I really do like the Spray on idea since it makes it extremely easy to get on hard to reach areas ( BACK! )</li>
            <li>You have to be very careful not to spray too much at one given time in any particular area because it can get greasy</li>
            <li>To be honest, I rarely put on a body moisturizer, which is not a good thing, however i always try to find one that is not sticky and absorbs fast, and since is hard to actually find it</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t like putting lotion because I sweat a lot with some creams and with this I don&#x27;t  have to worry about that problem its light and comfy.</li>
            <li>Be careful not to spray yourself in the face when first opening, as I did.</li>
            <li>and really helps dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I do get some dry skin, but lotion never seemed to help much.</li>
            <li>and I was surprised athow soft my skin felt, especially after working all day.</li>
            <li>i was not sure it was gonna do the trick like my originally lotion when i pumped and slather  on the product .</li>
            <li>you barely have to rub in!</li>
            <li>My life&#x27;s a little hectic right now with a new baby and going back to work, I was skipping moisturizer because I just didn&#x27;t have time.</li>
            <li>would skip if you have very dry skin or require a very moisturizing product, try the lotions or body oil gels.</li>
            <li>but i was greatly surprised that a bit after using it did save time even though you think to yourself how could i possible be bother with applying tribunal lotion like it took up half-your life span .</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t feel like the skin I used it on stayed nearly as moisturized as regular lotion.</li>
            <li>Absorbs fast after being sprayed on with just a minimal amount of being spread with your hands.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin really soft even the next day.</li>
            <li>I love to put lotion on after showering, but I never liked the sticky feeling it left especially when trying to put jeans or socks on.</li>
            <li>on.and let it dry on its on.the only problem wit it, is that it might run out fast.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a lotion that isnt going to be time consuming and messy to apply, as I am always on the go or running late, and I love this!</li>
            <li>i love it especially when I&#x27;m running late to work just spray, rub and out the door!</li>
            <li>I have had other products that are much easier to use.  </li>
            <li>They were all very subtle and refreshing.</li>
            <li>it does NOT dry on contact</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s 80 outside it feels like 90 due to the fact that there is so much humidity.</li>
            <li>Now I have no excuse to not put lotion on.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin moisturized and so soft, all day long.</li>
            <li>The other two seemed to just pffth out (for lack of a better word) and left a runny wet mess.</li>
            <li>a breeze, cuts my time while getting kids and myself ready in half..</li>
            <li>It leaves a funny and uneven film that feels way different from  lotions that I&#x27;ve been using all my life.</li>
            <li>Maybe my arms just aren&#x27;t long enough to get far enough to spray?!  </li>
            <li>The spray does not go directly on the skin you have to use quite a bit, I think that a product like a spray on moisturizer you loose quite a bit in the spray</li>
            <li>My only complaint is how quickly I run through this stuff.</li>
            <li>I think this is an ideal lotion for the summer because it&#x27;s not so heavy, but if one suffers from severe dry skin (especially during the winter months)</li>
            <li>This product has its good and bad things.  </li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> We use the Cocoa Radiant scent and that smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect to take along when traveling because of the way the spray nob closes to insure that the moisturizer does not leak out.</li>
            <li> and i can  win a brand challenge prize!</li>

            <li> just run under warm water</li>

            <li> I have to be honest here...</li>
            <li> so you can put your clothes inmediately, the nice cocoa smell is so nice.</li>

            <li> Love it, highly recommend it!!</li>

            <li> I was excited by the Cocoa radiant smell and it did not upset.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice summer moisturizer and feels nice to wear with lighter clothes, but by no means will it do the job in winter if you have very dry skin, like I do (My skin cracks in winter</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because I really love it for its easy to use and quick qualities, but there&#x27;s a certain fish-y smell that appears when you apply liberally.</li>

            <li> my kids find it fun and easy to use</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m really recommend the skin feel soft and shine is great</li>
            <li> It is light weight, absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t gunk up my rings.</li>
            <li> This goes on very light and works really well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easily the best of the available spray on lotions, as the mist is fine and lightweight enough to simply dry on the skin quickly without having to rub it in.</li>
            <li> Im in love with the new spray and go!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall i am pretty happy with this product will definitely be re</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s best for I&#x27;m running late n</li>
            <li> True to claim this is not the case with my Vaseline.</li>
            <li> I can say that all those things that it mention it would do, were in fact all true.</li>
            <li> The bottle has continuous spray which is very helpful if you are spraying more than one part of your body.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed that the gentle mist did not have any over spray.</li>
            <li> absolutely love this product because it makes my getting ready in the morning</li>
            <li> I love it so much</li>
            <li> The idea of spraying moisturizer is good and the demo video shows the job to be easier than it actually is.  </li>
            <li> The Aloe smelled light and fresh, which to me means almost scentless, in the squeeze bottle form.</li>
            <li> what i love about this product is that you don&#x27;t need so much time for moisturizer you body</li>
            <li> Sweet, cocoa butter smell that stays with you throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Many mornings I skip the lotion after I shower because I&#x27;m rushing around to get ready for work.</li>
            <li> The scent is nice too, it is soft and buttery.</li>
            <li> love how i can feel my skin absorbing this spray on lotion as soon as it is applied.</li>
            <li> This product is a perfect secondary moisturizer, in addition to a heavier type overnight.  </li>
            <li> The size is not bad and I&#x27;ve been using for a month and still have plenty.</li>
            <li> Very fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love it because it&#x27;s easy and not messy at all.  </li>
            <li> Love the scent its soft and its not oily its easy to spray on and go like it promotes no lie there.</li>
            <li> I never used lotion because of the effort of applying,  but this is so easy i can even spray it onto my own back.  </li>
            <li> other than that it is a great product.</li>
            <li> Love how convenient it is in the new design spray and go!</li>
            <li> I just did a quick rub, and my skin drank it up.</li>
            <li> The lotion is not greasy and quick drying.</li>
            <li> The spray allows me to cover more body areas more quickly, which is helpful since I&#x27;m always in such a rush.  </li>
            <li> Luckily I received one from the influenster program to try out.</li>
            <li> I can get an even spray quickly.</li>
            <li> It dries in seconds and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or grease behind, just smooth radiant skin with an awesome scent (reminds me of tanning products, not the chemical smelling ones but rather coconutty).</li>
            <li> and it drys quickly.</li>
            <li> The applicator it is convenient when in a rush to get ready, and my husband and I love it, is fun to apply moisturizer like that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even when taking the time to rub it in it dries fairly quick.  </li>
            <li> It is thinner, spreads evenly by spraying, and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this one in particular when I put it on</li>
            <li> I love the Vaseline Spray and Go mainly because I feel like I am always in a hurry to get somewhere</li>
            <li> Well, it is quick and convenient.</li>
            <li> This one in particular smells like suntan lotion to me and that I love the beachy smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It dries really quick</li>
            <li> Oh oh, I really don&#x27;t wear this type of product, but I do trust the brand, so far so good for me, so I gave it a go.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly but results are nothing that would make me run out and buy again.</li>
            <li> its fast &amp; easy to apply.. a little messy but, its still a great product &amp; leaves skin feeling amazing!!</li>
            <li> I also love the shape and design of the bottle because it gives it a high end look.</li>
            <li> It sprays on a pretty light coat</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always rushing and the thing that always slows me down is apply lotion to my body, so this product is great for that.</li>
            <li> It makes application super easy and fast.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin with a natural glow that i love cause it does not look greasy as other body spray do!&lt;br /&gt;Great price, great product.</li>
            <li> and I really like how easy it is to evenly apply the lotion.</li>
            <li> This is easy to apply and fast.</li>

            <li> This is so fast and easy to use in the morning.</li>
            <li> I absolutely fell in love with this the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li> It goes on easy and absorbs fast, just like it says.</li>
            <li> But, for how quickly it works, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It goes on easy and absorbs fast, just like it says.</li>
            <li> Its really easy to use and fast.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing this soon after I run out of the current one, price wise it pretty affordable too.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready to face the day!!</li>
            <li> So I tried this product and it was exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> If only it came in some fun, tropical, summer scents, I would like it even more!</li>
            <li> I loved the convenience and nice smell of this product, but it was not moisturizing enough for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> This product spray on nicely and is very light weight lotion that isn&#x27;t greasy or messy.</li>
            <li> I love the simplicity of a no mess no fuss lotion application!</li>
            <li> Specially if you are on the run ;)</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really worth $5 for this spray product versus a product that you have to pump out yourself and requires a little bit more time to rub into your skin.</li>
            <li> This products not only smells amazing-</li>
            <li> I tried all the scents and this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice, but the scent doesn&#x27;t last so it doesn&#x27;t clash with your perfume.</li>
            <li> this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually fun to use also.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li> It is immediately absorbed by the skin.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy, as far as smooth, my skin has been progressing!</li>
            <li> Honestly, you can spray and go just like the commercial.</li>
            <li> I receive Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer Cocoa Radiant complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster.  </li>
            <li> It seems the money would be better spent if the times you are able to use it would increase a tad bit.</li>
            <li> Ty InfluensterVox for my complimentary can.</li>
            <li> The spray promises leaving your skin “feeling healthy and glowing” and also after the application your skin will feel “instantly soft, not sticky or greasy“.  </li>
            <li> product is complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes</li>
            <li> That was fun.....</li>
            <li> With the brands I had been using, I would have to wait until my skin absorbed what it could and then wipe off any residue before getting dressed.</li>
            <li> It is well worth six bucks to try it.</li>
            <li> i love how soft leave my skin</li>
            <li> I received the cocoa butter scented bottle complimentary from Influenster</li>
            <li> I received this Vaseline product complimentary from Influenster in the viva voxbox.</li>
            <li> I always forget to buy one, but when I received this product from Influenster as a complimentary product for testing purposes</li>
            <li> What easier way to use this product, love it and will continue using it leaves my skin fresh and soft.</li>
            <li> I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes from influenster</li>
            <li> My favorite feature of this product is that it doesn&#x27;t give my skin that oily/greasy feeling and my second favorite feature is the lock and open twist top.</li>
            <li> Its amazing for last minute as your walking out the door super fast!</li>
            <li> Great scent, not strong.</li>
            <li> True to its claims, it is non-greasy, fast absorbing, and the spray is a smooth continuous flow.</li>
            <li> Other than that I think is a good product to buy...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s aboslutely perfect after a quick shower at the gym or when you need a little extra moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I like the convenience of the spray as opposed to guessing the right amount of lotion to spread on your body.  </li>
            <li> It puts out just the right amount of spray as isn&#x27;t greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I received it right away.</li>
            <li> I like to moisturize right out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I can just put my clothes right on.</li>
            <li> soaks right into the skin.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t you can take a shower spray lotion rub it in get dress right after wards.</li>
            <li> Just a slight pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> It is quick to dry, it smells great, does not mess up your clothes, and its not expensive.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, fantastic product and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The lotion gets absorbed super fast so you can get dressed right</li>
            <li> that said, I would recommend it for people with normal skin, if you have very dry skin or are looking for a creamy or oily moisturizer, this is not for you, since it does absorb quickly but it does moisturize well enough and, again, it smells delicious!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there are any unique active ingredients making the formula any more &#x27;age defying&#x27; than other creams and lotions, however, it&#x27;s so convenient and pleasant to use that I&#x27;m moisturizing more frequently, hence, softer, smoother skin.</li>
            <li> It sprayed on easily and left your skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> this cream is very practical, it is literary as easy as spray and go no need to let it dry because it dries quickly; not only does it have a wonderful smell but it also keeps the skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> It is an easy spray, it appears a bit thin and liquify but smells great</li>
            <li> It is great to use when your in a hurry, which is usually my case.</li>
            <li> They also think is fun to get sprayed they find it funny.</li>
            <li> so easy with no mess!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised at all the reviews that the fragrance was too strong because they weren&#x27;t to me.</li>
            <li> This spray moisturized my skin, soaked into the skin super fast and lasted all day.</li>
            <li> This sprays on a gentle lotion mist, you wipe it quickly and you&#x27;re off.</li>
            <li> wow really i loved this product&lt;br /&gt;its spray &amp; cream at the same time !</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how quick this really works.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the this product it really is a fast, easy, all day moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I  tried this product a little while ago and loved it from the get go, it&#x27;s a spray on, light, non greasy and fast absorbing</li>
            <li> The trick with this is to hold it back and just very lightly mist yourself.  </li>
            <li> I trueally love this lotion because it is so silky smooth its not a blob like the other lotions.</li>
            <li> The thing that i love about this lotion is that its quick to dry.</li>
            <li> It is not heavy and dries super quick.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I like how it leaves my skin so soft, smooth hydrated and radiant looking and doesn&#x27;t leave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d fallen in love with spray sunscreen for the same reason.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving it 4 out of 5 stars because I wish they had more scents.</li>
            <li> I put it on more often then regular lotion.</li>
            <li> Overall, however, I love mine and the smell,</li>
            <li> I always wondered about it but did not want to spend the money on something i wasnt sure it would actually work.</li>
            <li> skin is so soft and smooth when I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> Love the smell, Summer is definitely here.</li>
            <li> My husband was hesitant to use it at first</li>
            <li> he said it left his skin feeling oily and he didn&#x27;t like it but ended up using it more than me.  </li>
            <li> I recommend trying it could possibly work for you! :)</li>
            <li> really helps!</li>
            <li> #34;How can a lotion spray on and still moisturize?&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid lotion user and I make it a point to moisturize every day.  </li>
            <li> I actually think it helped me legs look better then before.</li>
            <li> Definitely feel Vaseline outdid themselves on this one. &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> ;-)  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes for the better, so I probably wont repurchase and stick to the extra minute</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely going to buy more when my can runs out.</li>
            <li> &#x27;m an avid lotion user and</li>
            <li> I tried this product which I love that I can keep in my car or big purse.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it is supposed to do- sprays moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to love to carry in my beach bag after the beach wish they had a smaller one to carry in my bag</li>
            <li> You spray and lightly rub in and your skin feels soft and well...</li>
            <li> Have the many of these bottles at home in different scents and my loves them!!</li>
            <li> However, I think that if you need to be aware to spray this one you in an area where it will not get on any of your clothing or w/ out anyone standing by you, so that it does land on them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non-greasy, soft when applied, leaving your skin feeling smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li> and my skin is so much happier with me!  </li>
            <li> I would say I love the product based on convenience alone, as the spray on quality makes it not only easy to apply but also fun, so you never forget to apply your daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light enough that it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling after it is rubbed in.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really have much of a smell (to me) and it dries quickly, so</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use, leaves skin so soft yet not oily,  dries fast</li>
            <li> Vaseline has so stepped up and created a lotion that is fast and easy for people with busy on the go lifestyles.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the fact that you just spray, smooth it out a little, and you&#x27;re ready to go!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this for people for travel often, don&#x27;t have much time when getting ready to moisturize and for anyone who loves smelling good and feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I tried it for a week straight and at first I liked it; but as I went on using it, it&#x27;s not really moisturizing at all.</li>
            <li> Especially good for moisturizing the back and hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> This spray on is a very fine mist, and colorless unless you linger on a certain spot for a long time.</li>
            <li> After I&#x27;ve just taken a shower I use my Spray and Go Coco radiant, it not only smells great but really helps with my dry skin.</li>
            <li> and I personally have enjoyed it.i really like the smell.its</li>
            <li> So first thing&#x27;s first, I really did like the concept of this product-</li>
            <li> Very, very helpful and a much needed feature.</li>
            <li> Overall it gives plenty of moisture, but I don&#x27;t really have very good hand control, so I feel like I wasted a lot of the product by accidentally over spraying myself.</li>
            <li> I pretty much use unscented products because I don&#x27; t like smelling like a walking perfume counter.  </li>
            <li> A soft non-greasy formula designed to go on smooth while giving you a lasting smooth finish without that greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> At first I though I might be putting too much on, but the quantity didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference.</li>
            <li> but im willing to spend the money because this product really works for me and my family.</li>
            <li> This is product was surprisingly good, I usually don&#x27;t wear lotion because I don&#x27;t have time</li>
            <li> I also expected the spray and go moisturizer to be exactly that; however, I have to rub it in because it lays in greasy pools on top of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I tried this out and it was easy to put on and a couple of rubs and my legs were not longer related to alligator skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to use especially if your always on the go.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quick and leaves skin so soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy especially when you&#x27;re on the go.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and leaves skin soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so simple and easy to use</li>
            <li> Vaseline Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer in Pure Cocoa Butter.</li>
            <li> I certainly recommend giving a whirl.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer has forgotten about a large segment of the population.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t help spraying a large plume of product into the air.</li>
            <li> Bought it because I thought it would be easy to spray on my back, which gets really itchy in the winter.  </li>
            <li> dries super fast and leaves your skin soft an refreshed.</li>
            <li> I definitely love this for traveling and hard to reach places where I can spray a quick layer!</li>
            <li> Interested in trying the other ones out :)</li>
            <li> My main issue was that, brrrr!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also really easy to spray on, sprays upside down and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was nice to use in hard to reach places and my skin felt immediately soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> If you are in a hurry, it is much faster to apply.</li>
            <li> It is a very convenient way to get moisturizer when you won&#x27;t take the time to rub in lotion after a shower.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really convenient to spray over your body and it moisture well</li>
            <li> Too much hassle.  </li>
            <li> fast</li>
            <li> I got the #sprayandgo vaseline lotion from @influenster for free in my #vivavoxbox to try and I have to say it is a definite must buy.</li>
            <li> and they really don&#x27;t like lotion</li>
            <li> i am very grateful that influenster &amp; Vaseline  provided this product and hopefully my family</li>
            <li> really like it for Summer/Spring</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m still and work I reapply and ready for the night life.</li>
            <li> and the whole process</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just so much faster</li>
            <li> do need to be cautious because while you are applying it, quite of it ends up on the floor making it really slippery.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am ready to get dressed.</li>
            <li> And let me tell you it really works as is advertised.</li>
            <li> This is really convenient.</li>
            <li> This product is very convenient when your in a hurry to leave...</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is very convenient.</li>
            <li> Goes on very smootly</li>
            <li> Thanks to Influenster</li>
            <li> This lotion is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Kinda pricey for the amount you get, seems like the bottle gets used up fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much easier than having to rub lotion on.</li>
            <li> I will never find myself without this product and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> You still have to rub on the product to your body, hence, the hands free approach is not the actual reason.  </li>
            <li> it is fast and non sticky 😘</li>
            <li> It works very well and all day  .</li>
            <li> The brown one dries out the skin too much.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Kinda pricey for the amount you get, seems like the bottle gets used up fast.</li>
            <li> The spray and go moisturizer is very convenient for anyone that is in a hurry.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s enough to enjoy.</li>
            <li> You can find this at really any drugstore.</li>
            <li> It also doesnt moisturize very well...</li>
            <li> I can imagine if you use way too much it might be sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> im always on a hurry that means that i don&#x27;t have so much time to apply product thanks to influenster</li>
            <li> I recently tried this product when it was sent to me by #Influenster for free.</li>
            <li> and you are ready to go.</li>
            <li> This product has really changed how i view moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light enough that I can get dressed soon after, but it does help add moisture.  </li>
            <li> So fast to apply.  </li>
            <li> I tried the product and it was very watery.</li>
            <li> But let&#x27;s be honest: using lotion is MESSY.</li>
            <li> I was able to try it recently and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to the old fashion lotion :)</li>
            <li> Good for the summer, but in the cold of winter you will need something more</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you have dry skin, but it&#x27;s ok for normal skin.</li>
            <li> I apply it right after the shower &amp; my skin feels soft all day.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> super easy to use.i especially use it for my back since I cant reach there</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and easy and cuts your time in half!</li>
            <li> great stuff, especially when you are lazy to put lotion on.</li>
            <li> However, it actually gets absorbed quickly into your body and leaves your skin soft and radiant.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice alternative for people who are running a little bit or are just a little more sluggish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like this product because it is so easy to use especially when you&#x27;re in a rush and busy doing things.</li>
            <li> It was nice being moisturized without feeling slick.</li>
            <li> I really like the idea of this, as I normally skip lotion because its time consuming</li>
            <li> Before receiving this from Influenster for reviewing purposes, I would skip on moisturizer because honestly I am a bit lazy</li>
            <li> I was so amazed when I first tried it  leaves your skin feeling soft and moisturized</li>
            <li> After I towel dry in the shower, I spray my back easily and rest of my body quickly rub it into my skin.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you put a towel down before you spray</li>
            <li> it does dry quick and feels like the creamy baby oil after it dries some loitions leaves you sticky feeling after you get hot.</li>
            <li> The tops of my legs are dry (almost scaley) during the winter months and since purchasing this product, I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference.</li>
            <li> works better than the previous lotion I was using.</li>
            <li> , I get more for less in a lotion rather than spray, and #3</li>
            <li> but I do feel that it is way too light for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> One quick spray will be enough moisture.</li>
            <li> Its simple and quick to apply.</li>
            <li> Especially with mw being pregnant and trying to bend over to reach my legs.</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase more in the future!</li>
            <li> I purchased all three of theses sprays (currently using this one) and I love it as well as the yellow can.</li>
            <li> Body lotion application is time consuming, particularly to an already hectic schedule.</li>
            <li> so i can get a layer around my body and rub it in quickly while my pores are all open.</li>
            <li> It claims to be \\&quot;fast absorbing\\&quot;, which it is, however, it all really depends on how far away from your skin you spray.</li>
            <li> I quickly spray, rub, and instantly feel moisturized!</li>
            <li> It absorbs so quickly and is not greasy at all, which is usually a big concern for me.</li>
            <li> I love because I put it on when I&#x27;m in a rush to go out without the mess of lotion.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend</li>
            <li> This is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I need heavier moisturizer due to extremely dry skin, but for everyday spray it on, smooth it in and go, this stuff is very nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not messy and it&#x27;s works!!</li>
            <li> Definitely would recommend to friends and now I&#x27;m n avid moisturizer!</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT LESS MESS</li>
            <li> I gave this to my 12 year old because she would use too much of my bottled lotion</li>
            <li> So much for shaving 20 seconds off my morning routine- I&#x27;ll stick with the old fashioned lotion pumps.</li>
            <li> I have two young children and this product makes my mornings so much easier.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know HOW many bottles of lotion I&#x27;ve wasted over the years.</li>
            <li> There are a few things I enjoyed about this Vaseline Spray and Go Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Bottom line be aware of the application process, but it really is so much quicker than traditional application!!  </li>
            <li> This is really fast and easy although for winter I had to use something a little heavier for my elbows and feet.</li>
            <li> I used this on my little one after bath time, it was fast and easy.</li>
            <li> The lotion is not at all greasy and absorbs into your skin quickly allowing you to put clothes on right away-no mess and</li>
            <li> because #1 hubby and I use same lotion and this wouldn&#x27;t last more than a week if not less.</li>
            <li> It feels amazing...and the best part is the ease by which it can be applied to the back and other hard to reach areas of the body.</li>
            <li> In spite of my less than spectacular reception, I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> The lotion itself is ok for regular skin, does not help really dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> Trying to have a 2yr old to hold still can be hard and this makes it quick and easy for me.</li>
            <li> but now I keep this right outside of the shower, spray it on and rub</li>
            <li> I started to try all the new products and came across the Vaseline Spray and Go. . .</li>
            <li> I live in sunny California</li>
            <li> I live in Florida, so that may be the issue.</li>
            <li> I like this new product that Vaseline has come up with since spreading cream all over your body</li>
            <li> It really does dry fast and does not take much rubbing in at all.</li>
            <li> the only problem is this goes super fast will last about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> #sprayandGo @influenster @vaselinebrand received this one free but will definitely be buying the next one!</li>
            <li> It is supper quick to dry and almost has a consistency closer to perfume than lotion in thickness.</li>
            <li> Its very easy to rub into your skin, takes less than a minute to moisturize your entire body.</li>
            <li> I actually burned my skin by mistake under a 12 mid day sun and got an ugly tan mark, my doctor friend recommended me to apply moisturizer and guess what, it have been so handy to have this spray to go, AMAZING!</li>
            <li> and i have a very sensitive nose.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this product didn&#x27;t cause any rash or irritation.  </li>
            <li> My first thought is this is such a gimmick</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says you get an instant mist of lotion</li>
            <li> but my skin is soft and not ashy at all!</li>
            <li> I recently tried the 2 other ones and I have to say this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that it can be a bit sticky at first.</li>
            <li> The scent is exactly the same as its squeeze bottle counterpart.</li>
            <li> skin feels so soft!</li>
            <li> i like the way that the spray feels on my skin and love the fact that i don&#x27;t have to wait a long time for it to dry!</li>
            <li> It does absorb into skin very quickly and eases the discomfort of dry skin to some degree, although it&#x27;s not up there with something like Eucerin, which is basically white axle grease..</li>
            <li> It does have a strong coco butter/vanilla scent, so be wary if you don&#x27;t like strong smells.</li>
            <li> Also, not to mention it is amazing for those hard to reach places, just Spray &amp; Go!</li>
            <li> Special A+ due to it</li>
            <li> I live in southern Texas where it&#x27;s very humid.</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower stall right after I dry off, so I don&#x27;t get it on the bathroom floor.</li>
            <li> It dries super fast and doesn&#x27;t leave that thick heavy feeling most moisturizers.</li>
            <li> My only concern, and this is more personal preference than an actual complaint, is that it feels like it runs out very quickly.</li>
            <li> It did an ok job , you are getting convenience of a spray  but contents of bottle compared to similar lotion not worth it !</li>
            <li> If you spray it far away enough from your body, you really don&#x27;t need to rub it in.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft after using</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely soft after using this product.</li>
            <li> I always forget to use lotion because I&#x27;m in such a hurry every morning to get ready.  </li>
            <li> so when I explained to him how it was used he was surprised.</li>
            <li> it squirts out evenly on your skin and leaves your skin glowing and soft.</li>
            <li> so when I sprayed this product my elbows became instantly soft.</li>
            <li> The only downside to the product is that if you spray it on over a tile floor, it gets really slippery.</li>
            <li> I like how it leaves my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> just soft dries like creamy baby oil.</li>
            <li> If you spray further away, it&#x27;ll soak in a whole lot faster</li>
            <li> I had my 11 year old son try it</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to everyone, it&#x27;s not heavy nor does it get sticky.</li>
            <li> Ladies, put on your big girl panties and use real lotion.</li>
            <li> So far I like it.</li>
            <li> I recommend for normal skin maybe not so much for dry skin.</li>
            <li> It allows me to moisturize my back and dry quickly</li>
            <li> oh so soft!&lt;br /&gt;I really do like the Spray on idea since it makes it extremely easy to get on hard to reach areas ( BACK! )</li>
            <li> You have to be very careful not to spray too much at one given time in any particular area because it can get greasy</li>
            <li> To be honest, I rarely put on a body moisturizer, which is not a good thing, however i always try to find one that is not sticky and absorbs fast, and since is hard to actually find it</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like putting lotion because I sweat a lot with some creams and with this I don&#x27;t  have to worry about that problem its light and comfy.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to spray yourself in the face when first opening, as I did.</li>
            <li> and really helps dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I do get some dry skin, but lotion never seemed to help much.</li>
            <li> and I was surprised athow soft my skin felt, especially after working all day.</li>
            <li> i was not sure it was gonna do the trick like my originally lotion when i pumped and slather  on the product .</li>
            <li> you barely have to rub in!</li>
            <li> My life&#x27;s a little hectic right now with a new baby and going back to work, I was skipping moisturizer because I just didn&#x27;t have time.</li>
            <li> would skip if you have very dry skin or require a very moisturizing product, try the lotions or body oil gels.</li>
            <li> but i was greatly surprised that a bit after using it did save time even though you think to yourself how could i possible be bother with applying tribunal lotion like it took up half-your life span .</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t feel like the skin I used it on stayed nearly as moisturized as regular lotion.</li>
            <li> Absorbs fast after being sprayed on with just a minimal amount of being spread with your hands.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin really soft even the next day.</li>
            <li> I love to put lotion on after showering, but I never liked the sticky feeling it left especially when trying to put jeans or socks on.</li>
            <li> on.and let it dry on its on.the only problem wit it, is that it might run out fast.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a lotion that isnt going to be time consuming and messy to apply, as I am always on the go or running late, and I love this!</li>
            <li> i love it especially when I&#x27;m running late to work just spray, rub and out the door!</li>
            <li> I have had other products that are much easier to use.  </li>
            <li> They were all very subtle and refreshing.</li>
            <li> it does NOT dry on contact</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s 80 outside it feels like 90 due to the fact that there is so much humidity.</li>
            <li> Now I have no excuse to not put lotion on.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin moisturized and so soft, all day long.</li>
            <li> The other two seemed to just pffth out (for lack of a better word) and left a runny wet mess.</li>
            <li> a breeze, cuts my time while getting kids and myself ready in half..</li>
            <li> It leaves a funny and uneven film that feels way different from  lotions that I&#x27;ve been using all my life.</li>
            <li> Maybe my arms just aren&#x27;t long enough to get far enough to spray?!  </li>
            <li> The spray does not go directly on the skin you have to use quite a bit, I think that a product like a spray on moisturizer you loose quite a bit in the spray</li>
            <li> My only complaint is how quickly I run through this stuff.</li>
            <li> I think this is an ideal lotion for the summer because it&#x27;s not so heavy, but if one suffers from severe dry skin (especially during the winter months)</li>
            <li> This product has its good and bad things.  </li>
            <li> but in a hurry or with children that hate the feeling of the think creamy stuff it really comes in handy .</li>
            <li> Also its so easy to use its not time consuming like some other moisturizers it just takes a few seconds !!</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as traditional lotion does.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much, because I have tried other moisturizers in the past that have left my skin feeling really oily and just not pleasant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it long enough now to experience how softer my skin is getting.  </li>
            <li> Also thought it would dry quickly and be less messy.  </li>
            <li> so if your looking for a thick consistent lotion you&#x27;ll need to find something else.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very long lasting and not over-powering one bit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It made me fee like I placed water on my skin and left it to dry.</li>
            <li> Though I do have to rub it in, the effort required is minimal and the amount of cream left on my hands is just enough to moisturize them.</li>
            <li> will definitely be repurchasing this product, possibly in the other formulations as well.</li>
            <li> It is so fast I hardly notice it.</li>
            <li> and because I hate the after feeling in my hands, but this product is amazing because you just spray it on your body and it doesn&#x27;t stay oily and doesn&#x27;t leave those white streaks and marks that are so gross.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t keep skin moisturizer for long.</li>
            <li> Since seeing the commercial I had been curious about this product.</li>
            <li> The smell does not wear off until a long time.</li>
            <li> I applied it in the morning and the scent lasted all day long.</li>
            <li> how long you had to wait to put clothes on or do anything for that matter.</li>
            <li> and yes, you do have to rub it in, but it doesn&#x27;t take as long as lotion</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like how long it takes lotion and other moisturizers to actually soak in your skin.</li>
            <li> I did not give it 5 stars because it feels weird on the initial contact (the very first time)</li>
            <li> With other lotions or moisturizers I find my self applying several times a day but</li>
            <li> The oat meal was virtually gone and my skin was dry again before the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I used it on my legs because they tend to get dry</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re skin dry ,flaky where you need to keep applying.</li>
            <li> (when I don&#x27;t have to worry about dry Winter skin) and for on-the-go.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always struggle with my dry skin  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to worry about dry skin for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> My elbows tend to go dry</li>
            <li> I have dry elbows and hands &amp; this</li>
            <li> You put it on, you have to wait for it to dry.</li>
            <li> Rinse, Towel Dry then spray this coco mist over your body.</li>
            <li> I had to spend time smoothing it on, waiting for it to dry, hoping it wouldn&#x27;t leave grease stains on my clothes.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> my skin is dry as this lotion doesn&#x27;t work there for me</li>
            <li> at first it was strange to spray on the thin layer of coco scented lotion</li>
            <li> Normal moisturizers are thick and chunky.</li>
            <li> I have used it upside down with no issues, and it has made my life easier as I am currently on crutches.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing i found to be a little misleading is how long you have to rub it in.</li>
            <li> I sprayed it on an already cool day and it left my legs really cold for a while</li>
            <li> takes so much less time to apply than traditional moisturizing lotions.</li>
            <li> I was starting to itch and scratch after about half an hour of using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it daily and it does moisturize without waiting forever for the typical moisturizer to soak in.</li>
            <li> You literally spray it on and rub in in about a second and a half.</li>
            <li> my skin from getting totally dry this winter, when it&#x27;s been extremely cold.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> The further away you spray the less you have to rub in, but the spray gets on other things around you.  </li>
            <li> You do have to be careful with overspray</li>
            <li> But if it doesn&#x27;t - you&#x27;re left sticky and impatient.</li>
            <li> As advertised, you can spray this on and get dressed a few minutes later.  </li>
            <li> , it moisturizes really well and doesn&#x27;t leave behind any greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> messy back.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like that wet sweaty feeling of lotion</li>
            <li> Applying it and it drying as shown on the commercial is not accurate.  </li>
            <li> Moisturizing felt like such a big production with the thick stuff from a bottle.</li>
            <li> at first when i heard of this product  on tv i was skeptical about its actual ability to rearly  make a diff race about how we apply typical  lotion.</li>
            <li> Also it isn’t very thick like other lotions that really moisturizer</li>
            <li> Other than that, it moisturizes really well and doesn&#x27;t leave behind any greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> it had a dry slightly powdery texture  .</li>
            <li> It was so easy to apply after my showers and didn&#x27;t feel thick or suffocating.</li>
            <li> I like to use aloe and some butters, but I&#x27;m not consistent whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I use other Vaseline products</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s no way this will compare to my other pricy</li>
            <li> and I was a bit skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> I also like that I feel moisturized without feeling greasy like I do with other moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy regular cream lotions.</li>
            <li> I sprayed this product on one arm, to see if I could tell the difference in my skin with one arm sprayed and the other without the product on.</li>
            <li> I usually end up having to put each item in different plastic bags because of it.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I would like to try the other bottles to compare to this one.</li>
            <li> I was shocked how easily this went on.</li>
            <li> I have weak hands and cannot exert enough pressure to depress the spray nozzle.  </li>
            <li> the price is the only bad part kind of expensive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it will be heavy enough for winter.  </li>
            <li> If you are like me and always on the run or running late it is definitely for you.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> I do throw a couple bath towels down to stand on while I use it.  </li>
            <li> although i like the spray idea... if the bottle gets turned upside down it clogs up.  </li>
            <li> It sprays on, you put it down and you&#x27;re out the door.</li>
            <li> The can can be tipped upside down, side to side, any way</li>
            <li> Literally you spray up then down on each side, rub in and your done.</li>
            <li> I guess it was due to the name!</li>
            <li> It does moisturize well, but it wasn&#x27;t what I expected!!</li>
            <li> All my other lotions will stay on the shelf!  </li>
            <li> As a black woman, I cannot afford for my lotion to wear off, and cause me to become ashy.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically use lotion.</li>
            <li> IT GOES ON IN HALF THE TIME.</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s no use for it if I&#x27;m just going to be scratching up my skin within half an hour.</li>
            <li> I just spray and wipe and no greasy mess and</li>
            <li> There is no sticky mess.</li>
            <li> NO GREASY MESS or washing your hands to try and get the rest of the lotion off.</li>
            <li> Aloe lasted a little longer, but Cocoa lasted the longest.</li>
            <li> I just grab the can, spray, and rub it in a little.</li>
            <li> The product is a little watery too.  </li>
            <li> I use a heavier moisturizer on my legs at night, and then before getting dressed in the morning, I spray this on and rub it in a little.  </li>
            <li> and I have to use heavy duty stuff).</li>
            <li> This seems to be a waste to me.</li>
            <li> but I do not use as my everyday lotion.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t really messy, but I do know that some spray will probably get on the floor.  </li>
            <li> The smell is too heavy, I can not stand it.</li>
            <li> (I do not notice it at all after it has dried).</li>
            <li> Just gotta rub it into your skin a few seconds longer.</li>
            <li> Not at all messy and moisturizer</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t mind a bit of a stronger scent; however, in my office at work a few ladies have trouble with perfumes, body lotions, etc upsetting allergies.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of chocolate/ cacao</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin, but hate the way thick lotions leave a sticky feel to the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick use, I like all of these because I hate using the creams, this works for me after swimming</li>
            <li> I like the contents of the product, but the spray head is impossible to exert enough pressure to depress the nozzle to dispense the product.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin and every doctor has told me to put lotion on, but I hate the fact that it takes way to long to sink into the skin and dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Get this lotion if you&#x27;re lazy like me.</li>
            <li> The can gets slick if you don&#x27;t use it the way they show.</li>
            <li> so If you are lazy when it come to put on lotion, or just don&#x27;t always have the time for it...</li>
            <li> im usually in a rush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why.</li>
            <li> I see that some are saying it smells terrible, but I love the smell.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s usually what I use on</li>
            <li> Then I usually had to wipe or wash my hands to get rid of the excess moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No stickiness or heavy residues!</li>
            <li> is not overwhelming and the moisture holds well.</li>
            <li> and I am very impatient at times.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when you spray it on yourself, it gets on the floor, and because this is basically oil, only a small amount on the floor will make it very slick.</li>
            <li> The smell is hardly noticeable and it doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feel like lotion does.</li>
            <li> I know that&#x27;s hard to believe.  </li>
            <li> The can is also so slippery that after you rub it on your skin it is hard to hold.  </li>
            <li> For that reason, I would recommend that you at least try it.</li>
            <li> however i found with the amount i sprayed at least</li>
            <li> I like to use it when I am running late to get in that moisture.</li>
            <li> The only thing is the lotion will be a bit chilly coming out of the can</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, because it is a spray, the can is empty before you know it</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the original or aloe one, but the Cocoa Radiant one smells like a terrible perfume.</li>
            <li> They were serious when they said you can spray and put on your clothes.</li>
            <li> The scent is subtle and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Seriously, your skin will thank you time and time again.</li>
            <li> I like it, but I feel it&#x27;s a little expensive.  </li>
            <li> was a little skeptical when ordering it</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars instead of 3 cause of the price its a little expensive.</li>
            <li> Even when the product has dried up, you can still smell a faint smell of the product on your skin.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that it is so silky and you can put it on thick or thin.</li>
            <li> I hate thick greasy lotions especially during the summer.</li>
            <li> I normally hate body lotion because it takes forever to dry and is usually too oily</li>
            <li> you go and does not leave a sticky residue behind</li>
            <li> I HATE rubbing in lotion and trying to hit all the areas on my back, so</li>
            <li> If my skin hadn&#x27;t broken out, I may have considered buying it again</li>
            <li> It is an unnecessary indulgence, but the convenience makes it irresistible to me.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I can see it being way too slick and dangerous on bathroom</li>
            <li> And I had a hard time finding a lotion that moisturized without feeling thick and gloopy :(</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to buy this product as it didnt seem like it would do what its been portrayed to do.</li>
            <li> My poor skin!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a deal breaker but it did make me sad.</li>
            <li> this stuff would never use Vaseline with an expensive dress or blouse, but this you can use.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical (&amp;</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Too expensive</li>
            <li> and it is on the expensive side compared to using a cream moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I hate putting on thick lotions because they make me feel sweaty and gunk up my rings.</li>
            <li> I think because it&#x27;s aerosol, that&#x27;s why it was so cold</li>
            <li> I will fall, it also traps dirt and makes my floor dirty faster.</li>
            <li> One drawback is that it gets really cold in lower temps</li>
            <li> Sprays in cold</li>
            <li> One drawback is that it gets really cold in lower temps and spraying it on can be a little...chilly.</li>
            <li> I also like that fact that when your hands are dirty with sand and you need to put sunscreen on...you don&#x27;t have to endure that sandy sunscreen application.</li>
            <li> but i was wrong!</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad, but I just don&#x27;t seem to feel moisturized after using this.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> Also the spray is very cold on the skin.</li>
            <li> , I hate feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Normally I hate lotion and can&#x27;t stomach the smell of coco butter</li>
            <li> and like I said I hate the smell of it.</li>
            <li> I hate taking the time to rub lotion in.</li>
            <li> I hate squeezing and pumping out lotion.  </li>
            <li> I always hated getting my hands all greasy while applying lotion.</li>
            <li> I am at the moment suffering terrible skin discolouration and allergy from using this product.</li>
            <li> Terrible product.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I loved the convenience and nice smell of this product, but it was not moisturizing enough for my dry skin. I will buy the lotion with the pump next.</li>
            <li> I like the convenience of the spray as opposed to guessing the right amount of lotion to spread on your body.  The only drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as traditional lotion does. As a black woman, I cannot afford for my lotion to wear off, and cause me to become ashy.  If you are in a hurry, it is much faster to apply. For that reason, I would recommend that you at least try it.</li>
            <li> I love this spray! It smells sooo good, and it works well.</li>
            <li> I like the product.  It is a very convenient way to get moisturizer when you won&#x27;t take the time to rub in lotion after a shower.  However, it is way too perfumy for me.  I pretty much use unscented products because I don&#x27; t like smelling like a walking perfume counter.  I would give this product 5 stars if they offered it in &amp;#34;Unscented&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to buy this product as it didnt seem like it would do what its been portrayed to do. The fragrance is awesome and all you haev to do is hold it away from your body then spray as you move it down. One quick spray will be enough moisture. The only thing i found to be a little misleading is how long you have to rub it in. They say one swipe of the skin and youre good to go however i found with the amount i sprayed at least, it took a couple swipes to get it rubbed in. Overall, awesome product that was worth the money.</li>
            <li> I reordered more of this product. Wonderfully easy to apply and is wonderful for the skin! I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I love the product.  Not greasy and smells nice.</li>
            <li> I was drawn by the concept and I really like how easy it is to evenly apply the lotion. I was amazed because I finally saw what it meant for your skin to be moisturized versus it just sitting on top of your skin. This does soak in well. I ordered all three (Cocoa, Aloe and Oat Meal) just to see which one I liked. I&#x27;m surprised at all the reviews that the fragrance was too strong because they weren&#x27;t to me. They were all very subtle and refreshing. BUT not all three moisturized equally. I rate cocoa the best at moisturizing, but I think that&#x27;s because the spray worked better for some reason with that bottle. It came out as a fine mist and covered evenly.  The other two seemed to just pffth out (for lack of a better word) and left a runny wet mess. The oat meal was virtually gone and my skin was dry again before the end of the day. Aloe lasted a little longer, but Cocoa lasted the longest. It&#x27;s a nice summer moisturizer and feels nice to wear with lighter clothes, but by no means will it do the job in winter if you have very dry skin, like I do (My skin cracks in winter and I have to use heavy duty stuff). You do have to be careful with overspray so I just stand on carpet when I put it on. Otherwise I can see it being way too slick and dangerous on bathroom tile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was nice to use in hard to reach places and my skin felt immediately soft and smooth. It was nice being moisturized without feeling slick. Now I can appreciate the difference. I&#x27;ll probably buy again, but just the cocoa and only in the summer.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a stronger cocoa scent, but after spraying, there is basically no scent.  I also expected the spray and go moisturizer to be exactly that; however, I have to rub it in because it lays in greasy pools on top of my skin.  Maybe my arms just aren&#x27;t long enough to get far enough to spray?!  It is very moisturizing though, and it&#x27;s very easy to use.  In spite of my less than spectacular reception, I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know HOW many bottles of lotion I&#x27;ve wasted over the years. I&#x27;m sure the number reaches in the millions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#x27;s in the beauty bible to moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;If you don&#x27;t moisturize, you&#x27;re going to get....WRINKLES.\\&quot; (EEK!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;If you don&#x27;t moisturize...your skin is going to CRACK and look OLD.\\&quot; (OH NO!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one could scare me into using lotion, by God! I do what I want! But I still felt a twinge of guilt for not using the mystical, magical lotion. I like to use aloe and some butters, but I&#x27;m not consistent whatsoever. My poor skin! What would the neighbors think? Maybe once a year I would dedicate myself to applying lotion, and I would keep it up...for two days. But let&#x27;s be honest: using lotion is MESSY. It&#x27;s time consuming. And frankly, I ain&#x27;t got for such nonsense. I&#x27;m lazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then! I saw the nifty commercial with the girl flipping her hat on her head after spraying on lotion! Spray-on lotion! Huh! I thought, \\&quot;Okay, that seems easy enough.\\&quot; So I went out and got the Cocoa Radiant spray and my life changed! I could moisturize in literally 1 minute! Where have you been all my life, spray-on lotion?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells great--not *too* strong of a smell, but you know it&#x27;s cocoa butter of some variety, and it&#x27;s so silky! I just did a quick rub, and my skin drank it up. Then I put on some clothes--although I could not flip a hat on my head--and I went on my way. Now I have no excuse to not put lotion on. It&#x27;s so easy, even a caveman (er, cavewoman) can do it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this lotion if you&#x27;re lazy like me. You&#x27;ll be moisturized, smell nice, and feel accomplished with no effort at all!</li>
            <li> I like it.  I agree with another reviewer, it has a scent. My main issue was that, brrrr!, it froze me to spray.  I think because it&#x27;s aerosol, that&#x27;s why it was so cold.... but if Vaseline could do sonething to make it toasty warm to the touch, then I would give it 6 stars!!</li>
            <li> This seems to be a waste to me. It is almost a texture of water. It doesn&#x27;t keep skin moisturizer for long. I guess if you are really in a rush its better than nothing but I do not use as my everyday lotion. I gave this to my 12 year old because she would use too much of my bottled lotion</li>
            <li> Such A Wonderful Product!! It was exactly as advertised!! Couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase!! I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really convenient to spray over your body and it moisture well</li>
            <li> This goes on very light and works really well. My skin feels so soft after using</li>
            <li> This is really fast and easy although for winter I had to use something a little heavier for my elbows and feet. Great for summer time though.</li>
            <li> great stuff, especially when you are lazy to put lotion on. the only problem is this goes super fast will last about 2 weeks. they should lower the price for the amount you have to buy.</li>
            <li> We use this at our beach house and it is just fantastic.  VERY easy to use and really helps dry skin.  We use the Cocoa Radiant scent and that smells wonderful.  Will be using this product forever, I predict.</li>
            <li> GREAT Spray Moisturizer</li>
            <li> I tried all the scents and this is by far my favorite.  Aloe is 2nd best.  I&#x27;m on auto-delivery for once a month.  A can lasts me a month using it once a day.  It is a MUST HAVE for your back.  It is a very light moisturizer.  I&#x27;m not sure it will be heavy enough for winter.  We&#x27;ll see...I do throw a couple bath towels down to stand on while I use it.  I toss them in the wash once a week or so.  It isn&#x27;t really messy, but I do know that some spray will probably get on the floor.  It smells nice, but the scent doesn&#x27;t last so it doesn&#x27;t clash with your perfume.</li>
            <li> I never considered moisturizer for my legs or arms for more than five minutes every two or three months.  Too much hassle.  Now I can spray my legs and arms in about 2 seconds.  I&#x27;ve been using it long enough now to experience how softer my skin is getting.  I believe this stuff just might be healthy for my skin!</li>
            <li> great product. Works like magic..My skin stays moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> This is easy to apply and fast. It smells great. Of course since it a spray on its not as good as a cream or lotion but its great for if youy are running late or in a hurry! Try it!</li>
            <li> this product isn&#x27;t oily and seems to nourish the skin ok.  nothing great compared to real cocoa butter or a cream that will penetrate the skin better.  although i like the spray idea... if the bottle gets turned upside down it clogs up.  i found myself spraying in my hand and then rubbing in which kinda defeats the purpose of the spray... wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer the smell is amazing and so easy to apply when on the go i just spray and im all set .</li>
            <li> Since seeing the commercial I had been curious about this product. I was able to try it recently and was pleasantly surprised. I used it on my legs because they tend to get dry and I admit I am not always good at remembering to lotion them up. I tried this out and it was easy to put on and a couple of rubs and my legs were not longer related to alligator skin. The scent is sweet but not bothersome to me. I definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> Easy n fast it&#x27;s best for I&#x27;m running late n need to moisturize!! It&#x27;s not messy and it&#x27;s works!! I use it on the whole family and we all love it! My fav is the cocoa butter one it smells great as well.</li>
            <li> I absolutly love my Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer Cocoa Radiant™ that I received in my Viva VoxBox complimentary from #Influenster for testing and review purposes. It&#x27;s perfect to take along when traveling because of the way the spray nob closes to insure that the moisturizer does not leak out. I also love the shape and design of the bottle because it gives it a high end look. I love that its easy to use when your in a hurry because all it requires is for you to spray it on your body and rub in quickly and your done. Its work great  to use after you come out of the shower as well. Another great attribute of the moisturizer is the smell. Its has a beautiful light Cocoa smell and leave your skin smelling delicious. I would definitely recommend this for people for travel often, don&#x27;t have much time when getting ready to moisturize and for anyone who loves smelling good and feeling soft.</li>
            <li> his product is fast and easy. and drys in seconds. smells good. easy to carry with you when your on the go</li>
            <li> This product works great and smells great (very tropical). It dries very fast which I love, I hate feeling greasy. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it is so easy to use especially when you&#x27;re in a rush and busy doing things. I like how it leaves my skin so soft, smooth hydrated and radiant looking and doesn&#x27;t leave you&#x27;re skin dry ,flaky where you need to keep applying. My first choice , best product ever..</li>
            <li> I loved this product! I received it through influenster for testing purposes! It goes on great and leaves skin so soft!! I really didn&#x27;t think I would like this, but I love it!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I got the #sprayandgo vaseline lotion from @influenster for free in my #vivavoxbox to try and I have to say it is a definite must buy. It puts out just the right amount of spray as isn&#x27;t greasy at all. Smells amazing and leaves skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> looking at all the reviews i noticed that not a lot of people like the scent but to be honest i did and i have a very sensitive nose. i like the way that the spray feels on my skin and love the fact that i don&#x27;t have to wait a long time for it to dry! my kids find it fun and easy to use and they really don&#x27;t like lotion so i am very happy that we where provided with this new fun way to moisturize their skin  :-) i am very grateful that influenster &amp; Vaseline  provided this product and hopefully my family and i can  win a brand challenge prize! i received this for testing purposes in the VivaVoxBox</li>
            <li> I love how quickly this dries, and how easy it is to dispense! I&#x27;d fallen in love with spray sunscreen for the same reason. Being able to spray it on after I get out of the shower, and then immediately climb into bed without making my sheets greasy, is amazing. My only complaint is how quickly I run through this stuff. I suppose that&#x27;s a testament to how good it is though!</li>
            <li> This lotion works really good, it leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth and the smells is just great. And the price is so affordable.</li>
            <li> The thing that i love about this lotion is that its quick to dry. They were serious when they said you can spray and put on your clothes. I was worried it was going to be sticky since it comes from a can... but i was wrong! Not sticky at all. I recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;*received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.*</li>
            <li> The lotion itself is ok for regular skin, does not help really dry winter skin. I haven&#x27;t tried the original or aloe one, but the Cocoa Radiant one smells like a terrible perfume. The scent is so strong it gave me a headache.</li>
            <li> I use other Vaseline products so I wanted to try this spray.&lt;br /&gt;I really like it for Summer/Spring (when I don&#x27;t have to worry about dry Winter skin) and for on-the-go.&lt;br /&gt;It provides light moisture that absorbs quickly so you can use as your dressing or as you step out of the shower. I like that you cab even spray while holding the can upside down.&lt;br /&gt;I would skip if you have very dry skin or require a very moisturizing product, try the lotions or body oil gels.</li>
            <li> Use this for after showering to moisturize skin and doesnt leave you greasy feeling. Recomend buying to anyone that showers</li>
            <li> I have to admit if the influenster didn&#x27;t send me this product to test I would of never bought it. My first thought is this is such a gimmick and there&#x27;s no way this will compare to my other pricy lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I giggle that there&#x27;s instructions how to apply, but it&#x27;s useful! The can gets slick if you don&#x27;t use it the way they show. The scent is subtle and not overpowering. I used it last and I can still smell it on me. The lotion is not greasy and quick drying. You would think this also means not lasting this isn&#x27;t the case at all! My skin is extremely soft after using this product. I even used it on my freshly shaved legs and I have zero irritation bumps! I highly recommend. I&#x27;m only giving it 4 out of 5 stars because I wish they had more scents. I prefer a fruity scent.</li>
            <li> I have to admit this was a genius idea lotion in a spray , it is so fantastic and easy to spray on, smells delicious &amp; goes on so smooth on skin , its the best way to apply when your on the Go. What a great moisturizer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously in a big hurry in the morning, I spray on my Vaseline Spray and Go and I&#x27;m ready to face the day!! It doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling on my skin and I stay moisturized moisturized for 10 hours. If I&#x27;m still and work I reapply and ready for the night life. This is a definite must have for people on the go but especially for moms on the go.</li>
            <li> I love the easy application and it really does moisturize well. It is definitely convenient for people who are constantly on the go. I just received it about a week or so ago and it is awesome! Definitely recommend, I want to try all of them!</li>
            <li> The Vaseline spray and go moisturizer is really good I received one through influenster and I liked it. It&#x27;s really easy to use especially if your always on the go.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and dries fast! I have never used a spray on moisturizer and I was a bit skeptical at first. After receiving this product free from influenster I had the opportunity to give it a try. I like it and for 5.99 I don&#x27;t think its that pricey considering you get about 30 uses.</li>
            <li> I  tried this product a little while ago and loved it from the get go, it&#x27;s a spray on, light, non greasy and fast absorbing moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;The scent of it is magnificent! I can&#x27;t get enough. And the best part is that it leaves my skin amazingly soft; After a full week of continuos use, my skin felt quite healthy and oh so soft!&lt;br /&gt;I really do like the Spray on idea since it makes it extremely easy to get on hard to reach areas ( BACK! ) and the whole process it&#x27;s just so much faster so If you are lazy when it come to put on lotion, or just don&#x27;t always have the time for it... This is definitely the product for you!&lt;br /&gt;You do need to be cautious because while you are applying it, quite of it ends up on the floor making it really slippery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall i am pretty happy with this product will definitely be re purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Disclaimer**&lt;br /&gt;I received this product, thanks to Influenster.com for testing proposes, and by posting this review i will be entered to win a badge prize.&lt;br /&gt;My opinion on this product its no compromised by the statement above, this is my 100% most honest opinion!</li>
            <li> I received a free bottle from Influenster in my Viva Vox Box and I could not be happier. It is easy to apply when I&#x27;m in a rush and the smell is so calming and relaxing. In no way it is greasy and my skin looks great. I would totally purchase this product for my family.</li>
            <li> I always have bottles of creams everywhere but never seem to finish them because of the time to sit there and apply. Thank God to Vaseline Spray and Go Mositurizer I am able to apply quick and it smells GREAT too :) Definitely A+++ Recommended</li>
            <li> I always tend to forget to put lotion on when im at home cause im usually in a rush. This product is so fast and easy to put on that im always putting on lotion. it does as it says. you just spray and go. the smell is amazing too! love it &lt;33 i received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and i am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
            <li> I always forget to use lotion because I&#x27;m in such a hurry every morning to get ready.  I received Vaseline Spray and Go complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes (and I&#x27;m entering the Branch Challenge for a chance to win a prize) so I used it and I haven&#x27;t stopped! I like that it&#x27;s so quick and easy to use.  The spray allows me to cover more body areas more quickly, which is helpful since I&#x27;m always in such a rush.  I also like that I feel moisturized without feeling greasy like I do with other moisturizers.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Super easy to use.Absorbs quick and leaves skin so soft. Works great for those that have dry skin. Also smells good #SprayAndGo</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to get my hand on this baby for a while. Luckily I received one from the influenster program to try out. This product is just as good as people say it is. It is so easy to use and quick to apply that know I put it on more often then regular lotion. I have dry skin and every doctor has told me to put lotion on, but I hate the fact that it takes way to long to sink into the skin and dry. But this Spray and go lotion is amazing. I spray it on, rub and in about a minute I am ready to get dressed. Its a light formula so thats what allows it to sink into your skin faster. Keep in mind this is a light lotion so if your looking for a thick consistent lotion you&#x27;ll need to find something else. Overall, however, I love mine and the smell, ugh sooo good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically use lotion. I&#x27;m not sure why. I do get some dry skin, but lotion never seemed to help much. And I had a hard time finding a lotion that moisturized without feeling thick and gloopy :( I received this spray and go from Influenster for testing purposes and was pleasantly surprised at how much I loved it! It was so easy to apply after my showers and didn&#x27;t feel thick or suffocating. Definitely would recommend to friends and now I&#x27;m n avid moisturizer!</li>
            <li> The trick with this is to hold it back and just very lightly mist yourself.  It does help clothes slip on easier after a shower and provides a tiny bit of moisture.  It isn&#x27;t a deep moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this product I received it for free to review from Influenster in a voxbox. It is so easy to use and the smell of this amazing!! It&#x27;s actually fun to use also. I apply it right after the shower &amp; my skin feels soft all day. works better than the previous lotion I was using. Will definitely purchase</li>
            <li> I recieved the Vaseline Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer from Influenster and it is something I wanted to try out since it came out. It is so easy to use BUT the fact that it includes alcohol in its ingredients is a NO for me. Also it isn’t very thick like other lotions that really moisturizer but I will definitely use it when on the go.    [...]</li>
            <li> I love the ease of spraying it right from the can. I can get an even spray quickly. I&#x27;ve had no problems with the nozzle getting clogged. It&#x27;s light enough that it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling after it is rubbed in. The smell is also pleasant.</li>
            <li> Vaseline spray and go is amazing. My life&#x27;s a little hectic right now with a new baby and going back to work, I was skipping moisturizer because I just didn&#x27;t have time. My skin wasn&#x27;t liking that but with Vaseline spray and go  I can moisturize in no time. Love it, highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Tried this for the first time compliments of influenster voxbox and LOVED it!!! Very fast and easy to use. I&#x27;ll never go back to the old fashion lotion :)</li>
            <li> Amazing product! So great for moisturizing on the run or in a rush. Perfect for moms who wanna keep their kids from having dry skin and works wonders for yourself as well!! A+ all the way around. Not oily but lasts all day!!</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because I really love it for its easy to use and quick qualities, but there&#x27;s a certain fish-y smell that appears when you apply liberally. It&#x27;s also really easy to spray on, sprays upside down and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer i received it complimentary from Influenster to try and its awesome ! It smells amazing and moisturizes well its not too heavy or light its perfect. Also its so easy to use its not time consuming like some other moisturizers it just takes a few seconds !! #Brandchallenge</li>
            <li> Vaseline Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer in Pure Cocoa Butter. A soft non-greasy formula designed to go on smooth while giving you a lasting smooth finish without that greasy feeling. A must for your Summer beauty arsenal.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I hoped it would be, but smelled even better than I thought! #sprayandGo @influenster @vaselinebrand received this one free but will definitely be buying the next one!</li>
            <li> I love my spray and go! It&#x27;s so easy especially when you&#x27;re on the go. It smells really good and is not greasy at all.i received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and i am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
            <li> I love love love this. I got this from influenster for complimentary testing purposes and it&#x27;s is amazing. I love that it&#x27;s easy to spray on, it leaves my skin so super soft and smells really good. This will be my go to moisturizer it&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re big fans of Vaseline lotion. I had already seen the commercial for this product but my husband had not, so when I explained to him how it was used he was surprised. I loved the smell, smells so good! And feels great on skin, its not greasy but leaves skin glowing, gives it a nice moisturized look and feel. But, to be honest I wouldn&#x27;t purchase Spray &amp; Go because #1 hubby and I use same lotion and this wouldn&#x27;t last more than a week if not less. #2 The price, I get more for less in a lotion rather than spray, and #3 It took me just about the same if not longer to spray and wait for it to absorb, as I would to pump and rub lotion on. Those are my nays, my yays are the wonderful cocoa radiant smell, the fact that it does leave skin looking glowy and moisturized without that greasy feel.</li>
            <li> I got this to try for free in a program called Influenster. I always wondered about it but did not want to spend the money on something i wasnt sure it would actually work.So i was really happy when i received it free to try. And let me tell you it really works as is advertised. It is immediately absorbed by the skin. It leaves my skin moisturized and so soft, all day long. And for me, the best part is that it does not leave any oily, greasy residue like other lotions. Which makes it perfect for hot weather or right out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I recieved my Vaseline Coco Raidant Spray and Go in my @Influenster #VivaVoxBox and I have to say it was one of my favorite items in the box that I received. After I&#x27;ve just taken a shower I use my Spray and Go Coco radiant, it not only smells great but really helps with my dry skin. I&#x27;ve always struggle with my dry skin  bc I live in southern Texas where it&#x27;s very humid. If it&#x27;s 80 outside it feels like 90 due to the fact that there is so much humidity. With other lotions or moisturizers I find my self applying several times a day but Coco Radiant Spray and Go I simply apply after my shower. My skin stays smooth and literally radiant all day and doesn&#x27;t require more than one use. I highly recommend the this product it really is a fast, easy, all day moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is product was surprisingly good, I usually don&#x27;t wear lotion because I don&#x27;t have time and because I hate the after feeling in my hands, but this product is amazing because you just spray it on your body and it doesn&#x27;t stay oily and doesn&#x27;t leave those white streaks and marks that are so gross. Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.&lt;br /&gt;It smells wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is so soft and smooth when I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;The continuous spray feature makes it super easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t too greasy in your hands after your rub it in.&lt;br /&gt;Easy lock lid so it won&#x27;t spill.</li>
            <li> I really liked this lotion. It sprayed on easily and left your skin feeling smooth. I thought that you were able to just spray and go but you also have to rub it in. It&#x27;s not a deal breaker but it did make me sad. I like to use it when I am running late to get in that moisture.</li>
            <li> Application of this product is amazing. It sprays on evenly and smooth, and has a beautiful glow to it. It seems like it will last a while before I run out. Overall a great product!</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite! I received this free from influenster and Im so glad i got the chance to try it. I hate thick greasy lotions especially during the summer. This is the perfect quick light moisturizer! The spray feature also locks so you can take it with you without worrying about accidents.</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use,Spray it and rub it into your skin. it&#x27;s kinda like hair spray for your body. it squirts out evenly on your skin and leaves your skin glowing and soft. Love the smell, Summer is definitely here. So easy to use and more time to enjoy your summer. The smell reminds me of chocolate and coconut. Love it because it&#x27;s easy and not messy at all.  The spray dispenser is really awesome, comes with a lock option so you won&#x27;t spill any in transport or if it falls over.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward for what more will come from this line from Vaseline! I absolutely love the fact that you just spray, smooth it out a little, and you&#x27;re ready to go! I see that some are saying it smells terrible, but I love the smell. And it&#x27;s cheaper here than anywhere else, so if you want stock up! I received it in my VivaVoxBox from Influenster for free, and it states that retail price is $7.99. That&#x27;s the only thing I can complain about. It doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy, as far as smooth, my skin has been progressing!</li>
            <li> So I got this on influenster to try and let me tell you I love it. It sprays on great and I love the smell. I use it after my showers, before bed and whenever I feel like I need it! I will buy it again when it finishes.</li>
            <li> I got to try this product complimentary from influenster, and i love it!!&lt;br /&gt;its easily applicable and leaves my skin smooth</li>
            <li> This is really convenient. If you spray it far away enough from your body, you really don&#x27;t need to rub it in. It smells great and works like cocoa butter!</li>
            <li> I love the spray and go! It so easy to use and it leaves your skin so silky and smooth...not too mention it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy at all.  If you are like me and always on the run or running late it is definitely for you.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you @influenster #vivavoxbox for sending it to me complementary to try and entering me in the Brand Challenge.</li>
            <li> This product is very convenient when your in a hurry to leave... i loved how it was easy to spray on rub in and jump into your clothes and go especially when i had over slept and was in a hurry to get to work.  Thanks to Influenster for sending it to me in the #Viva VoxBox complimentary to test out!!!! My husband was hesitant to use it at first he said it left his skin feeling oily and he didn&#x27;t like it but ended up using it more than me.  It sprays on evenly and you just rub it in and your all set.  My skin felt smooth and looked radiant after an eight hour shift.  It does leave a strong cocoa smell but I like the smell so it was ok for me.  Overall it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like putting lotion because I sweat a lot with some creams and with this I don&#x27;t  have to worry about that problem its light and comfy.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is very convenient. Goes on very smootly but I do feel that it is way too light for my dry skin. I might try spraying extra and see if that works. I like that its not sticky or leaves residue. I recommend for normal skin maybe not so much for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I got this product compliments of Influenster and I absolutely love it! It is super easy to easy to apply, just spray on desired area and blend in to skin. It dries in seconds and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or grease behind, just smooth radiant skin with an awesome scent (reminds me of tanning products, not the chemical smelling ones but rather coconutty).</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says you get an instant mist of lotion and you just have to rub around the area and it drys quickly. I love the smell it leaves me feeling smooth and refreshed . Thank you Influenster #VivaVoxBox for the product even though product was supplied for review this review is honest and accurate.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff. I always hated getting my hands all greasy while applying lotion. I use lotion daily. only complain is the nozzle gets clogged, but that is inevitable with a spray bottle like this. just run under warm water and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great prouduct. It smells good and its super easy. It literally is \\&quot;spary and go\\&quot; I recommend this product definitely a must try</li>
            <li> Normally I hate lotion and can&#x27;t stomach the smell of coco butter so when influenster sent me Vaseline Spray and Go I was kind of iffy about it. I use this every morning and just like the name claims I just spray and go. The smell is hardly noticeable and it doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feel like lotion does. The size is not bad and I&#x27;ve been using for a month and still have plenty. I&#x27;m trying to get my fiance to use it also because he still uses Vaseline coco butter and like I said I hate the smell of it.</li>
            <li> I like how it is so easy to use anywhere you go and does not leave a sticky residue behind</li>
            <li> I love the simplicity of a no mess no fuss lotion application! I just spray and wipe and no greasy mess and my skin smells and feels amazing!! Love how light weight it is and I can put it in my purse! I received this via influenster for testing purposes</li>
            <li> Honestly, you can spray and go just like the commercial. I love this stuff would never use Vaseline with an expensive dress or blouse, but this you can use.</li>
            <li> Perfect for summer! Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy. Its simple and quick to apply. My skin feels so smooth and I don&#x27;t have to worry about dry skin for the rest of the day. Definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> this cream is very practical, it is literary as easy as spray and go no need to let it dry because it dries quickly; not only does it have a wonderful smell but it also keeps the skin hydrated. i really loved this product that i received through #influesnter for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I receive Vaseline® Spray &amp; Go Moisturizer Cocoa Radiant complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster.  I loved it!! It is not greasy.  You just spray and go.. I wish I would have discovered this product before now..</li>
            <li> I received the Vaseline Spray &amp; Go for testing purposes in my VivaVoxBox from Influenster and was pretty impressed with the quality. I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much, because I have tried other moisturizers in the past that have left my skin feeling really oily and just not pleasant. True to claim this is not the case with my Vaseline. It is supper quick to dry and almost has a consistency closer to perfume than lotion in thickness. I liked that a lot as  I don&#x27;t like how long it takes lotion and other moisturizers to actually soak in your skin. The smell was a nice cocoa scent, and it is nothing that overpowered your senses. My only concern, and this is more personal preference than an actual complaint, is that it feels like it runs out very quickly. I have only used the spray a couple of times and yet it is already halfway done. It seems the money would be better spent if the times you are able to use it would increase a tad bit. Also the spray is very cold on the skin. I sprayed it on an already cool day and it left my legs really cold for a while so it didn&#x27;t make for very enjoyable feeling.</li>
            <li> I really like the idea of this, as I normally skip lotion because its time consuming and I don&#x27;t like the feel of it, so I thought this would be perfect. Unfortunately, when you spray it on yourself, it gets on the floor, and because this is basically oil, only a small amount on the floor will make it very slick. Not only does this make me scared I will fall, it also traps dirt and makes my floor dirty faster.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff it smells so good and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy after you spray it on! i use it right out of the shower!!! i highly recommend it!!!i received this product from influenster for testing purposes and i absolutely love this product i am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize!!!</li>
            <li> This is so fast and easy to use in the morning. I just grab the can, spray, and rub it in a little. The only thing is the lotion will be a bit chilly coming out of the can so it can catch you off guard. I definitely love this for traveling and hard to reach places where I can spray a quick layer!</li>
            <li> I got this in a review box from @Influenster and love it! It&#x27;s aboslutely perfect after a quick shower at the gym or when you need a little extra moisturizer. I wasn&#x27;t sure at first if it was giving me the best coverage as traditional lotion but my skin is soft and not ashy at all! Thank you #SprayandGo, @VaselineBrand and @Influenster</li>
            <li> I received this free from @influenster and was extremely excited to try.  It is an easy spray, it appears a bit thin and liquify but smells great and once you spread in it works great!</li>
            <li> #sprayandgo from VaselineBrand is easy to use on the go,and convenient specially being a mom! Ty InfluensterVox for my complimentary can.I am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and has a pleasant smell to it. Absorbs quickly and leaves skin soft and not greasy. Interested in trying the other ones out :)</li>
            <li> This is a great idea and product for people on the go! I recently tried the 2 other ones and I have to say this one is my favorite. It glides on great and the scent is very light. When I received it in the mail via influenster I was excited, even though you can get at a great price still always fun to receive a product you already love for free!</li>
            <li> I absolutely fell in love with this the first time I tried it. Not only does it moisturizer you skin well, it&#x27;s also so convenient! It&#x27;s called Spray and Go for a reason! I&#x27;m always on the go so this is a great product for the busy people out there. It smells great and dries in seconds. I was definitely repurchase and recommend this to my friends and family members. Thanks to Influenster I was able to test this amazing moisturizer, I&#x27;m also entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
            <li> I loved this product it smells great, My skin looked silky and it moisterizes in a flash. I use it on me and my kids especially since I do not like the feel of lotion between my fingers. It is so fast I hardly notice it.</li>
            <li> I received this moisturizer from Influenster for free, and my first impression is that it smells awesome, kinda like marshmallows, then I applied it after a shower and did it like in the commercials LOL! applied in my legs, arms and tummy, and it felt too light, I had to re-apply it behind my legs and arms. The moisturizer lasted all day, and the scent just a couple of hours. Also, while cleaning my bathroom, I noticed that some of the spray got on my walls, so I guess I have to better my aim with it!! The applicator it is convenient when in a rush to get ready, and my husband and I love it, is fun to apply moisturizer like that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, I would recommend it for people with normal skin, if you have very dry skin or are looking for a creamy or oily moisturizer, this is not for you, since it does absorb quickly but it does moisturize well enough and, again, it smells delicious!</li>
            <li> I usually buy regular cream lotions. I just wasn’t sure I would get my money’s worth. I sprayed this product on one arm, to see if I could tell the difference in my skin with one arm sprayed and the other without the product on. I couldn’t get over the smell of it! It smells like cocoa butter which I love, but it reminds me of the Hawaiian Tropical Tanning Lotions . The spray promises leaving your skin “feeling healthy and glowing” and also after the application your skin will feel “instantly soft, not sticky or greasy“.  I can say that all those things that it mention it would do, were in fact all true. I am definitely going to purchase this as soon as I run out of product. My elbows tend to go dry so when I sprayed this product my elbows became instantly soft.</li>
            <li> i got it for free from www.influenster.com in my vivavox box! i love it ! it was easy to use and smell amazing its not sticky like most spray lotions! the price is the only bad part kind of expensive</li>
            <li> Love this product! Vaseline Spray and Go keeps me moisturizer all day and my skin looking great! This product is a must buy!</li>
            <li> I received my Vox box and I was so excited! I started to try all the new products and came across the Vaseline Spray and Go. . . I tried it for a week straight and at first I liked it; but as I went on using it, it&#x27;s not really moisturizing at all. It made me fee like I placed water on my skin and left it to dry. Maybe if they added hydraulic acid in the ingrediants it could be a water based moisturizer. Not my favorite, but I recommend trying it could possibly work for you! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and I&#x27;m entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tootles,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Janelly</li>
            <li> I just luv this product! its easy to use and convenient. I spray it on every morning after I shower and it does not leave a greasy residue at all!! It is easily absorbed in the skin &amp; leaves me feeling refreshed! I have dry elbows and hands &amp; this really helps! It is great for moms on the go or anyone that has a hectic morning routine! Moisturizing hasn&#x27;t been this easy well in since forever!!!  I deff recomend this for everyone that needs something fast &amp; easy to use!!</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin, but hate the way thick lotions leave a sticky feel to the skin. This spray moisturized my skin, soaked into the skin super fast and lasted all day. Definitely will be repurchasing this many more times!</li>
            <li> I got this for free through influenster for testing purposes and I am  entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize. just wanted to say this moisturizer is really good I love how my skin feels with it. I love that it is not greasy and it is so easy to put on when you are on the go, but what I  don&#x27;t really care for is the coco butter smell thank god it is not that overpowering but you can smell it but other than that it is a great product.</li>
            <li> Loved how easy this lotion applies, and I especially love the fact that it is not greasy whatsoever! The scent is great, not to overpowering! I think this is an ideal lotion for the summer because it&#x27;s not so heavy, but if one suffers from severe dry skin (especially during the winter months) this might not be the ideal moisturizer. I live in sunny California so this is the ideal lotion for me 24/7 365 days a year for me!</li>
            <li> There are a few things I enjoyed about this Vaseline Spray and Go Moisturizer. The bottle has continuous spray which is very helpful if you are spraying more than one part of your body. It is also perfect if you just want to spray one area. I enjoyed that the gentle mist did not have any over spray. It is a finely mist that covers your skin well. It is non-greasy as well. One thing for me is that it is very light. Normal moisturizers are thick and chunky. Not Vaseline Spray and Go Moisturizer, it goes on smooth and easy. If you are like me, I take a lot of products on the road with me when I travel. I, however do not have the best luck at keeping bottles from spilling out in my bags. I usually end up having to put each item in different plastic bags because of it. Well you do not have to worry about that with Vaseline Spray and Go Moisturizer. It has a locking cap that keeps it from spraying everywhere. Just lock it into place and throw it in a bag and go! Very, very helpful and a much needed feature. I would gladly recommend this to friends, family and anyone else looking for a product that is hassle free. I tested this product through Influenster.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, lotion can be cumbersome. You put it on, you have to wait for it to dry. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t. If it does, you&#x27;re good to go. But if it doesn&#x27;t - you&#x27;re left sticky and impatient. For that person with the sticky legs (or arms), LOOK NO FURTHER, this product is for you! This sprays on a gentle lotion mist, you wipe it quickly and you&#x27;re off. There is no sticky mess. You don&#x27;t have to worry about getting this product on your clothes as you&#x27;re hastily getting dressed to run out the door. I got this product from Influenster as a free &amp;#34;try it and see&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve seen this in the store and on TV, and I&#x27;ll admit - I was skeptical (&amp;#34;How can a lotion spray on and still moisturize?&amp;#34;). Well, I assure you - it does moisturize, both quickly and effectively. This lotion is the real deal. It sprays on, you put it down and you&#x27;re out the door. I certainly recommend giving a whirl.</li>
            <li> As advertised, you can spray this on and get dressed a few minutes later.  It has&lt;br /&gt;kept my skin from getting totally dry this winter, when it&#x27;s been extremely cold.&lt;br /&gt;Just wish it lasted longer -  I go through one every 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I like the contents of the product, but the spray head is impossible to exert enough pressure to depress the nozzle to dispense the product.  This problem lowers the score to a &#x27;1&#x27;.  I have weak hands and cannot exert enough pressure to depress the spray nozzle.  It is NOT senior citizen friendly.  The manufacturer has forgotten about a large segment of the population.  I will NEVER buy this product again, but I WILL ADVERTISE to my friends about my experience.  Of course there are no instructions on how to dispense.  I have had other products that are much easier to use.  I will be buying them instead.  If I could rate this a zero, I would.</li>
            <li> I received @VaselineBrand #SprayAndGo Mosturizer in Cocoa Radiant compliments from @Influenster in the #VivaVoxBox for testing purposes and I am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize!&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this product because it makes my getting ready in the morning a breeze, cuts my time while getting kids and myself ready in half..i just spray and go!! i love the fact that it leaves my skin feeling healty and glowing after each application. Talk about the formula is is not sticky nor greasy which i love..you must try it today, I think you&#x27;ll love it as much as i do!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid lotion user and I make it a point to moisturize every day.  This stuff is good.  It goes on easy and absorbs fast, just like it says. One drawback is that it gets really cold in lower temps (I&#x27;m an Indiana girl) and spraying it on can be a little...chilly.  Other than that, it moisturizes really well and doesn&#x27;t leave behind any greasy feeling.  Kinda pricey for the amount you get, seems like the bottle gets used up fast.</li>
            <li> Before receiving this from Influenster for reviewing purposes, I would skip on moisturizer because honestly I am a bit lazy but now I keep this right outside of the shower, spray it on and rub and that&#x27;s it. It is not heavy and dries super quick. Awesome invention by Vaseline!</li>
            <li> I HAD TO ORDER THIS WHEN I SAW IT ADVERTISING ON T.V. THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT LESS MESS AND YOU DON&#x27;T NEED ALOT OF IT. IT GOES ON IN HALF THE TIME.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s so much easier than having to rub lotion on. It doesn&#x27;t give you that greasy gross feeling. I received it right away. Great product.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for a very ravenously and more wonderful and deal with you very excellent and went very quickly I will return you to buy another set soon</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this, still happy, but the amount of moisture I need, tends to be more than this can deliver. I live in Florida, so that may be the issue. I love the smell of this, think Bath and Body Warm Sugar Vanilla......The can can be tipped upside down, side to side, any way and it still comes out. Be careful not to spray yourself in the face when first opening, as I did. That was fun.....</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product I got it in my Influenster viva box box!! I was so amazed when I first tried it  leaves your skin feeling soft and moisturized and it&#x27;s not sticky what&#x27;s so ever I love it so much and I would recommend it to any one!!</li>
            <li> I tried this on my legs and I fell in love with it! I actually think it helped me legs look better then before.</li>
            <li> I like to moisturize right out of the shower. With the brands I had been using, I would have to wait until my skin absorbed what it could and then wipe off any residue before getting dressed. That is so not the case with this wonderful lotion! I can spray it on, rub it in and get dressed to start my hectic days!  I will never find myself without this product and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This product has its good and bad things.  I received a free full size sample by mail.  The idea of spraying moisturizer is good and the demo video shows the job to be easier than it actually is.  You still have to rub on the product to your body, hence, the hands free approach is not the actual reason.  The product is a little watery too.  However, it actually gets absorbed quickly into your body and leaves your skin soft and radiant.  I like Vaselne products and I would continue buying their products.</li>
            <li> I love how easy it is to apply and how fast it dries. Leaves skin smoothe and radiant. Doesn&#x27;t stain clothing.</li>
            <li> I love it. It does quick smells awesome. Very easy to use. Especially with mw being pregnant and trying to bend over to reach my legs. I love that I can just spray and go.</li>
            <li> I like to keep this moisturizer with me mostly the whole day because it&#x27;s perfect when I am in a rush to go to work and don&#x27;t have time to rub in a heavy or creamy moisturizer. I keep it in my makeup bag most of the time, but when I am home I keep it by my bed side so when I get out of the shower I have easy access to hydrated skin. I love this scent most solely because it contains cocoa butter and that&#x27;s usually what I use on it&#x27;s own at night time when I really have the time to rub in my moisturizer to my skin. All I do is spray this onto my skin wait about 30 seconds for it to settle, rub and go...it&#x27;s that simple! You have to be very careful not to spray too much at one given time in any particular area because it can get greasy so it&#x27;s best to spray it at a good distance and only once to that area.

            <li> I love it being so convenient I use it right out the shower my kids love it also hope this helps</li>
            <li> I really love this product. It is quick to dry, it smells great, does not mess up your clothes, and its not expensive. Definitely feel Vaseline outdid themselves on this one. &#x3D;] Received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
            <li> I have received this product from influenster and I personally have enjoyed it.i really like the smell.its super easy to use.i especially use it for my back since I cant reach there I just spray it on.and let it dry on its on.the only problem wit it, is that it might run out fast.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this is in a spray bottle. It makes application super easy and fast. It does have a strong coco butter/vanilla scent, so be wary if you don&#x27;t like strong smells. Otherwise, fantastic product and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> at first when i heard of this product  on tv i was skeptical about its actual ability to rearly  make a diff race about how we apply typical  lotion. at first it was strange to spray on the thin layer of coco scented lotion it had a dry slightly powdery texture  . i was not sure it was gonna do the trick like my originally lotion when i pumped and slather  on the product . but i was greatly surprised that a bit after using it did save time even though you think to yourself how could i possible be bother with applying tribunal lotion like it took up half-your life span . but in a hurry or with children that hate the feeling of the think creamy stuff it really comes in handy . all in all a great useful product</li>
            <li> I love the product is very easy to use I&#x27;m really recommend the skin feel soft and shine is great</li>
            <li> This product is great for on the go moisture. I hate putting on thick lotions because they make me feel sweaty and gunk up my rings. This product, which I received for free to try out via Influenster, was just the ticket. It is light weight, absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t gunk up my rings. Even my husband likes it! I will definitely purchase more in the future! -Julia (Jeff&#x27;s wife)</li>
            <li> I got this free in an influenster viva vox box and love it! Its amazing for last minute as your walking out the door super fast! Smells great, feels amazing and last all day!</li>
            <li> I liked this moisturizer. I love the convenience of spraying it on. If only it came in some fun, tropical, summer scents, I would like it even more!</li>
            <li> This spray on is a very fine mist, and colorless unless you linger on a certain spot for a long time. It&#x27;s easily the best of the available spray on lotions, as the mist is fine and lightweight enough to simply dry on the skin quickly without having to rub it in. I use it in the shower stall right after I dry off, so I don&#x27;t get it on the bathroom floor. It doesn&#x27;t really have much of a smell (to me) and it dries quickly, so I can just put my clothes right on. I HATE rubbing in lotion and trying to hit all the areas on my back, so this is my favorite thing in the world right now. It&#x27;s winter, and my entire body is actually moisturized for a change. This stuff is awesome. I will definitely keep buying it.</li>
            <li> its wow really i loved this product&lt;br /&gt;its spray &amp; cream at the same time !&lt;br /&gt;also i love this flavor ::::)))&lt;br /&gt;5 stars :D</li>
            <li> Seems to moisturizer well, but I dislike the coconut smell. I prefer the yellow can. It has a nicer smell.  I wish they made it odor free.  Too many products with fragrances all clashing, isn&#x27;t very nice.</li>
            <li> The Vaseline Spray and Go is really a great product. It allows me to moisturize my back and dry quickly so I don&#x27;t have to wait forever to put my clothes on. The only downside to the product is that if you spray it on over a tile floor, it gets really slippery. Just make sure you put a towel down before you spray and you&#x27;ll be fine! Over all, its a great lotion! Love the way this smells!!</li>
            <li> Meh. Not impressed. It sprays on a pretty light coat and I didn&#x27;t feel like the skin I used it on stayed nearly as moisturized as regular lotion. So much for shaving 20 seconds off my morning routine- I&#x27;ll stick with the old fashioned lotion pumps.</li>
            <li> Love it!! And the service was great</li>
            <li> Love to be able to spray and go!</li>
            <li> I bought this at my grocery store... cheaper here on Amazon.  Applying it and it drying as shown on the commercial is not accurate.  I know that&#x27;s hard to believe.  ;-)  When applying it make sure you do so with a towel or something under your feet as it is a spray and sprays all around.  The further away you spray the less you have to rub in, but the spray gets on other things around you.  I keep a towel just for this purpose.  Even when taking the time to rub it in it dries fairly quick.  Bottom line be aware of the application process, but it really is so much quicker than traditional application!!  I actually have time to do this.</li>
            <li> Canned lotion, that&#x27;s all</li>
            <li> This spray moisturizer is everything it says,the only downside ,it&#x27;s costly on Amazon ,I will be purchasing it elsewhere,Wal-Mart or Cvs</li>
            <li> Works great. Sprays in cold</li>
            <li> A great stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> I like it, but I feel it&#x27;s a little expensive.  It doesn&#x27;t leave oil or anything. seems to work as indicated.</li>
            <li> I love it it is fast and non sticky 😘</li>
            <li> Test in a small area first. It contains more than 20 ingredients some of which are classified as allergen and toxic. Such as&lt;br /&gt;Butylphenyl Methypropional and Benzyl Salicylate  ( search these to read about them ) I am at the moment suffering terrible skin discolouration and allergy from using this product.</li>
            <li> Terrible product. You can&#x27;t help spraying a large plume of product into the air. It contains parabens which are toxic to lungs. I could smell it on my breath for hours. Advise not to use around children.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it does. It works very well and all day  . I just wish it lasted longer.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure that this sprays more in the air than on your body. You do still have to rub it in to your skin.</li>
            <li> It did an ok job , you are getting convenience of a spray  but contents of bottle compared to similar lotion not worth it ! Too expensive</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell. The smell is too heavy, I can not stand it. The smell does not wear off until a long time.</li>
            <li> was a little skeptical when ordering it but I am in love! dries so quickly and I will deffinatly be buying more</li>
            <li> My mistake! When I oredered it, I thought this lotion had a bronzer/self-tanner in it! I guess it was due to the name! It does moisturize well, but it wasn&#x27;t what I expected!!</li>
            <li> But....This is one is not so great but does not moisturize as well as the yellow spray can. The brown one dries out the skin too much.</li>
            <li> Bought it because I thought it would be easy to spray on my back, which gets really itchy in the winter.  Also thought it would dry quickly and be less messy.  Turns out it needs to be rubbed in........oops........messy back.  But, the WORST part is that it took me 15 minutes to clean up the greasy bathroom floor so no one slips and falls!!!!!!</li>
            <li> goes on smooth, rub it in... and then you go.  makes skin feel moisturized and has a wonderful smell to it</li>
            <li> This product is my favorite of All the Vaseline Sprays. I have all of them. What I do is pour Vaseline coco baby oil into the bubble bath, soak my skin for about 25 minutes, then washup with your favorite body wash. Rinse, Towel Dry then spray this coco mist over your body. Ladies youll have silky smooth legs, arms etc..Special A+ due to it being an \\&quot;add on item\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> This is definitely 5 stars!!!  Easy spray on... your hands don&#x27;t get all that cream on them and when you spread it on it just glides over your skin!!  Light but it works!  the twist on and off spray nozzle is the best!  Thank you to this seller for stocking one of the BEST items ever!!</li>
            <li> This would make a great product for handicapped or elderly users. My skin feels great and my clothes are not affected</li>
            <li> I purchased all three of theses sprays (currently using this one) and I love it as well as the yellow can. It smells really good, there is no greasy residue and it absorbs quickly into your skin. It does everything they said it would. Definite keeper!</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail and it works great! I got cocoa radiant and it smells really good. It&#x27;s easy to use all you have to do is spray it on then rub it in. I like how it leaves my skin soft and moisturized. I&#x27;m very happy with this product and can&#x27;t wait to try the others!</li>
            <li> Body lotion application is time consuming, particularly to an already hectic schedule. As a result, I sometimes skip the body moisture to save time. My skin has suffered as a result. So a couple of weeks ago I was thrilled to have stumbled upon this &#x27;Spray and Go&#x27; moisturizer. True to its claims, it is non-greasy, fast absorbing, and the spray is a smooth continuous flow. The scent is light (I do not notice it at all after it has dried). It feels amazing...and the best part is the ease by which it can be applied to the back and other hard to reach areas of the body. The tops of my legs are dry (almost scaley) during the winter months and since purchasing this product, I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference. I don&#x27;t think there are any unique active ingredients making the formula any more &#x27;age defying&#x27; than other creams and lotions, however, it&#x27;s so convenient and pleasant to use that I&#x27;m moisturizing more frequently, hence, softer, smoother skin. It&#x27;s also great to keep a bottle in your car when on the run. I&#x27;ve actually sprayed my arms and legs while in my car at traffic lights and it has not left residue on my leather interior or clothing. Great find and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I leave this in my shower after i bathe so i can get a layer around my body and rub it in quickly while my pores are all open. The smell isn&#x27;t bad, but I just don&#x27;t seem to feel moisturized after using this. It leaves a funny and uneven film that feels way different from  lotions that I&#x27;ve been using all my life. I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes for the better, so I probably wont repurchase and stick to the extra minute it takes me to rub actual lotion on myself.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot.  After I towel dry in the shower, I spray my back easily and rest of my body quickly rub it into my skin.</li>
            <li> Moisturizing felt like such a big production with the thick stuff from a bottle. I had to spend time smoothing it on, waiting for it to dry, hoping it wouldn&#x27;t leave grease stains on my clothes. Then I usually had to wipe or wash my hands to get rid of the excess moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is everything I needed moisturizer to be. It is thinner, spreads evenly by spraying, and absorbs quickly. Though I do have to rub it in, the effort required is minimal and the amount of cream left on my hands is just enough to moisturize them. My skin stays hydrated all day. I love the cocoa butter scent; it is long-lasting but not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recommended this to ALL my girlfriends. It is well worth six bucks to try it.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed in this product.  I saw it on tv and I knew I had to have it so I bought the Cocoa Radiant.  I think the advertising is incorrect it does NOT dry on contact you have to rub it in and to me it seems a bit greasy.  The spray does not go directly on the skin you have to use quite a bit, I think that a product like a spray on moisturizer you loose quite a bit in the spray but that&#x27;s the case in anything you spray on.  The can is also so slippery that after you rub it on your skin it is hard to hold.  I do have to say that the lock lid is great!  I&#x27;m happy I tried it but I will never purchase it again. I love all Vaseline products this was just not one of them.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Smells like cocoa and you do just like it says. I ususally put it on after shower. I spray it on put on my clothes and go. It doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky or greasy just soft dries like creamy baby oil. I love it. Would recommend too a friend. I gave it 4 stars instead of 3 cause of the price its a little expensive. But I will and have ordered more.</li>
            <li> Absorbs fast after being sprayed on with just a minimal amount of being spread with your hands.  takes so much less time to apply than traditional moisturizing lotions.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how quick this really works. Seller gave me a valuable coupon at ordering. Leaves skin really soft even the next day. I have dry skin so I am very impressed. Thanks</li>
            <li> I hate taking the time to rub lotion in. This works great if you apply it right you barely have to rub in! Price is great also!!! Diffenitly hope this product stays around!</li>
            <li> I have two young children and this product makes my mornings so much easier. I also like the fact that it is so silky and you can put it on thick or thin.</li>
            <li> So first thing&#x27;s first, I really did like the concept of this product- it just didn&#x27;t work out for me specifically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEGATIVES:&lt;br /&gt;1. It claims to be \\&quot;fast absorbing\\&quot;, which it is, however, it all really depends on how far away from your skin you spray. The closer you spray (the more moisturizing as well), the more product you get on your skin but it takes a second to rub it in. If you spray further away, it&#x27;ll soak in a whole lot faster but the product will get sprayed onto the floors, walls, etc etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. This product actually caused my skin to break out. I was starting to itch and scratch after about half an hour of using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The price. I honestly don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really worth $5 for this spray product versus a product that you have to pump out yourself and requires a little bit more time to rub into your skin. You&#x27;re basically compensating time for money with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;POSITIVES:&lt;br /&gt;1. Like I said before, the concept is great. It&#x27;s a nice alternative for people who are running a little bit or are just a little more sluggish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The smell. Even when the product has dried up, you can still smell a faint smell of the product on your skin. It&#x27;s very long lasting and not over-powering one bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I will NOT be re-purchasing the product. If my skin hadn&#x27;t broken out, I may have considered buying it again but there&#x27;s no use for it if I&#x27;m just going to be scratching up my skin within half an hour.</li>
            <li> This fabulous #SprayAndGo moisturizer was given to me free for testing purposes compliments of Influenster.  I love it. I can spray my legs and arms and be lotioned up in seconds.</li>
            <li> This fabulous #SprayAndGo moisturizer by Vaseline was given to me free for testing purposes compliments of Influenster. In writing this review, I am entering a Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize. I would say I love the product based on convenience alone, as the spray on quality makes it not only easy to apply but also fun, so you never forget to apply your daily moisturizer. It also has a nice smell. I&#x27;m not a fan of how it feels afterward, though, as my skin often feel somewhat sticky for a while. At first I though I might be putting too much on, but the quantity didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference. I give it 3 out of 5 stars. Mary Kay Timewise moisturizer still holds the trump card in over all effectiveness because of this downside. @VaselineBrand @Influenster #StillAMaryKayGirl</li>
            <li> absolutely loved it goes on easily and is not sticky the smell is so amazing. Best product and definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised. This product spray on nicely and is very light weight lotion that isn&#x27;t greasy or messy. It goes on smoothy and has a light weight feeling on the skin and doesn&#x27;t make you look like you just applied oil on yourself. Not to mention that the cocoa butter smell is always refreshing. I have been looking for a lotion that isnt going to be time consuming and messy to apply, as I am always on the go or running late, and I love this!</li>
            <li> Its a fairly good product.Quick and easy to use ! I use it daily and it does moisturize without waiting forever for the typical moisturizer to soak in.</li>
            <li> Amazing! The lotion dries quickly and is easy to apply. Doesn&#x27;t make your fingers feel greasy, either. The reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it just doesn&#x27;t moisturize like a regular lotion. But, for how quickly it works, it&#x27;s worth it. One bottle lasts about a month if you use it every day.</li>
            <li> All my friends wanna try it when they see it, love this flavor that I got also. Amazing product it is</li>
            <li> Great concept.  It&#x27;s great to spray on when getting out of the shower.  I use the towel to spread it on.  Unfortunately, because it is a spray, the can is empty before you know it and it is on the expensive side compared to using a cream moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I like this new product that Vaseline has come up with since spreading cream all over your body is a hassle. but the reason I will only give 4 out of five stars is because to me the product is still a bit greasy even though it states that its not. Other than that I think is a good product to buy... Specially if you are on the run ;)</li>
            <li> this spray is so convenient. you just spray in the desired area and rub. It doesn&#x27;t leave you sticky or greasy and I love the way it makes my skin feel. I also like the smell. i use it all over my body.</li>
            <li> I received this spray and go lotion compliments of influenster for the purpose of reviewing and I have to say that I love it!! I would definitely recommend this lotion. I&#x27;m definitely going to buy more when my can runs out. It&#x27;s so simple and easy to use and I was surprised athow soft my skin felt, especially after working all day. It doesn&#x27;t have that greasy lotion feel either, which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> &#x27;m an avid lotion user and I make it a point to moisturize every day. This stuff is good. It goes on easy and absorbs fast, just like it says. One drawback is that it gets really cold in lower temps and spraying it on can be a little...chilly. Other than that, it moisturizes really well and doesn&#x27;t leave behind any greasy feeling. Kinda pricey for the amount you get, seems like the bottle gets used up fast.</li>
            <li> I love this product and i love my skin since i got it from Influenster i love how soft leave my skin i highly recommended  to all people who want to get better skin!</li>
            <li> The spray and go moisturizer is very convenient for anyone that is in a hurry. I&#x27;m a college student so it is great for me. I&#x27;m always rushing and the thing that always slows me down is apply lotion to my body, so this product is great for that. Its really easy to use and fast. The smell is incredible and it sticks with you for the majority of the day. The one thing I did not like as much is that the consistency is somewhat watery but besides that it is a very good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to put on I love because I put it on when I&#x27;m in a rush to go out without the mess of lotion. Just Spray and go I love the smell of this one in particular when I put it on it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m spraying on chocolate lol. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of chocolate/ cacao but I love the smell it&#x27;s not too strong but it&#x27;s enough to enjoy.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it goes on smooth.  It is easy to apply and lasts a long time.  I did not give it 5 stars because it feels weird on the initial contact (the very first time) then it is not an issue.</li>
            <li> I tried this product which I love that I can keep in my car or big purse. I sometimes forgot to moisturize my legs when I&#x27;m in a hurry. It&#x27;s a great fix. The only drawback is that it can be a bit sticky at first.</li>
            <li> I love to put lotion on after showering, but I never liked the sticky feeling it left especially when trying to put jeans or socks on. This Spray and Go has changed all that. I quickly spray, rub, and instantly feel moisturized! No stickiness or heavy residues! And the fragrances are a plus! I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love the Vaseline Spray and Go mainly because I feel like I am always in a hurry to get somewhere and I am very impatient at times. So I tried this product and it was exactly what I needed! It absorbs so quickly and is not greasy at all, which is usually a big concern for me. So I can put on my clothes right away after spraying and be on my way :) Also, not to mention it is amazing for those hard to reach places, just Spray &amp; Go!</li>
            <li> I gave this 5 stars, because it is so easy to use. It is great to use when your in a hurry, which is usually my case. It isn&#x27;t sticky at all, and the smell is pleasant. You can find this at really any drugstore.</li>
            <li> I have to thank Influenster for sending me this product to try. Most amazing lotion I have ever tried and it is so easy to put on. Literally you spray up then down on each side, rub in and your done. NO GREASY MESS or washing your hands to try and get the rest of the lotion off. The perfect amount is distributed when it is sprayed out. Amazing product, I wish I would have discovered this sooner.</li>
            <li> Yeah, I caved. I bought the cocoa butter scented one this time. It reeks, so when I buy it again I&#x27;ll return to the regular scent. Why did I do it? Well, it is quick and convenient. I need heavier moisturizer due to extremely dry skin, but for everyday spray it on, smooth it in and go, this stuff is very nice. It is an unnecessary indulgence, but the convenience makes it irresistible to me. Especially good for moisturizing the back and hard to reach areas. Don&#x27;t get it on the floor unless you plan to go skating! It is super slippery! It does absorb into skin very quickly and eases the discomfort of dry skin to some degree, although it&#x27;s not up there with something like Eucerin, which is basically white axle grease..but the Spray and Go is nice and light and it is convenient.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this spray. It is so easy to apply. Would recommend for those who moisturize on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Its ok.... I would not buy it again. It doesnt spray evenly on skin, you still have to rub it in like regular cream. It also doesnt moisturize very well...glad I tried but wont buy again</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it is supposed to do- sprays moisturizer. If you FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS, which include rubbing it in, you will not have any problems using it. The scent is exactly the same as its squeeze bottle counterpart. I have used it upside down with no issues, and it has made my life easier as I am currently on crutches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it smells like cocoa butter. No, the scent is not overpowering. I can imagine if you use way too much it might be sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have used spray sunscreen, that is a good reference for how this product works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be repurchasing this product, possibly in the other formulations as well. The Aloe smelled light and fresh, which to me means almost scentless, in the squeeze bottle form.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff - it smells FABULOUS, isn&#x27;t greasy, and is so easy to apply.  I&#x27;m never going back to cream moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I love having this for when I am in a rush in the mornings. And I am always in a rush.</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t too overbearing. I purchased the Cocoa Radiant. Sprays on easily and evenly. Dispenser doesn&#x27;t get clogged. Just gotta rub it into your skin a few seconds longer. Sorta reminds me of how it takes a minute for sunscreen to absorb into your skin.</li>
            <li> Love the scent its soft and its not oily its easy to spray on and go like it promotes no lie there.I&#x27;m going to love to carry in my beach bag after the beach wish they had a smaller one to carry in my bag that is how convenient it is.</li>
            <li> what i love about this product is that you don&#x27;t need so much time for moisturizer you body im always on a hurry that means that i don&#x27;t have so much time to apply product thanks to influenster i could try this.</li>
            <li> Putting lotion on can not get any easier than this. I received the cocoa butter scented bottle complimentary from Influenster and I love it. I applied it in the morning and the scent lasted all day long. I had my 11 year old son try it and he loved it as well. This is a great product for kids because it is easy to use. #sprayandgo @influenster @vaselinebrand</li>
            <li> I have to be honest here...I avoided putting lotion on because of the greasy feel and how long you had to wait to put clothes on or do anything for that matter. This was perfect. You spray and lightly rub in and your skin feels soft and well...Like skin! No greasy after feel just clean, moisturized, cocoa radiant skin!</li>
            <li> got my free sample from influenster and i just fell in love. it was so easy for someone like me who doesnt like the application process for most lotions. such a headacheless process!</li>
            <li> Love how convenient it is in the new design spray and go! makes putting on lotion so easy with no mess! Have the many of these bottles at home in different scents and my loves them!!</li>
            <li> I was able to try out this product and I had to share how much I love it. It&#x27;s not greasy, has a nice soft smell, and sprays easily. Not at all messy and moisturizer well! Definitely glad to have switched to this!</li>
            <li> I thought this product was great, It goes on nicely and leaves your skin feeling very hydrated. I would recommend this to everyone, it&#x27;s not heavy nor does it get sticky. Great job by Vaseline</li>
            <li> This product was absolutely so easy to use! It dries super fast and doesn&#x27;t leave that thick heavy feeling most moisturizers. I&#x27;ve got the cocoa butter one which is a plus, love the smell!!</li>
            <li> I received this Vaseline product complimentary from Influenster in the viva voxbox. This products not only smells amazing- it&#x27;s very effective, too! It&#x27;s great for in the go because the easy to use spray nozzle. The lotion is not at all greasy and absorbs into your skin quickly allowing you to put clothes on right away-no mess and no wait! I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Love this product! love Cocoa and smells just like it! i love it especially when I&#x27;m running late to work just spray, rub and out the door! so easy to use my kids use it all the time! skin feels so soft! would recommend!&lt;br /&gt;thank you @VaselineBrand @influenster!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and that you are entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
            <li> I love this product, because it&#x27;s so easy to use! I love that my hands don&#x27;t get oily with sunscreen. I also like that fact that when your hands are dirty with sand and you need to put sunscreen on...you don&#x27;t have to endure that sandy sunscreen application. Just spray and go :)</li>
            <li> I love this it makes it so easy to lotion up my kids after their baths. Just spray, rub and go! Trying to have a 2yr old to hold still can be hard and this makes it quick and easy for me. They also think is fun to get sprayed they find it funny. I got to try mine through Influenster for free and glad I liked it. I will be purchasing this soon after I run out of the current one, price wise it pretty affordable too.</li>
            <li> I trueally love this lotion because it is so silky smooth its not a blob like the other lotions. You literally just spary and go. This one in particular smells like suntan lotion to me and that I love the beachy smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definatly recomend and buy for my family. I would like to try the other bottles to compare to this one.</li>
            <li> Received this in a voxbox free and love it! It is a very unique way of applying lotion but I like it! It smells great and is super moisturizing!</li>
            <li> I recently tried this product when it was sent to me by #Influenster for free. I was excited by the Cocoa radiant smell and it did not upset. The scent is easy on the nose and one of the things that I liked was that it is easy to use. However, I think that if you need to be aware to spray this one you in an area where it will not get on any of your clothing or w/ out anyone standing by you, so that it does land on them. Overall it gives plenty of moisture, but I don&#x27;t really have very good hand control, so I feel like I wasted a lot of the product by accidentally over spraying myself. Easy to use &amp; I do recommend it for anyone who dislike putting lotion on their hands the scent is not overwhelming and the moisture holds well.</li>
            <li> its fast &amp; easy to apply.. a little messy but, its still a great product &amp; leaves skin feeling amazing!! (received complimentary from Influenster for testing &amp; a entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win prize)</li>
            <li> I used this on my little one after bath time, it was fast and easy. soaks right into the skin. This is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this product didn&#x27;t cause any rash or irritation.  (Yay!) Sweet, cocoa butter smell that stays with you throughout the day. It&#x27;s non-greasy, soft when applied, leaving your skin feeling smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like that wet sweaty feeling of lotion then this is the product for you. It dries very quickly and the scent is wonderful.</li>
            <li> been using this product for over a year and it is one of my must haves!..dries super fast and leaves your skin soft an refreshed. the cocoa smell its yummy too!</li>
            <li> I was able to test this product for free thanks to influenster.&lt;br /&gt;It fits perfect into my daily routine, i am always rushing and sometimes don&#x27;t even have the time to apply some lotion but those days are over.&lt;br /&gt;just spray some on your legs and arms and you are ready to go. It dries really quick so you can put your clothes inmediately, the nice cocoa smell is so nice. It leaves my skin with a natural glow that i love cause it does not look greasy as other body spray do!&lt;br /&gt;Great price, great product.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I rarely put on a body moisturizer, which is not a good thing, however i always try to find one that is not sticky and absorbs fast, and since is hard to actually find it I always forget to buy one, but when I received this product from Influenster as a complimentary product for testing purposes I was like... Oh oh, I really don&#x27;t wear this type of product, but I do trust the brand, so far so good for me, so I gave it a go. I most say I will have never buy this product for me, so is was a surprise, it smells amazing, it does moisture my skin, absorbs really fast (even in a humid weather) and is not sticky or grease at all. I actually burned my skin by mistake under a 12 mid day sun and got an ugly tan mark, my doctor friend recommended me to apply moisturizer and guess what, it have been so handy to have this spray to go, AMAZING! So what can I tell you, I got sold :P Now going to have to look for it, good thing I can buy it here from amazon too!</li>
            <li> I received this moisturizer from Influester, and I overall like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- VERY easy to apply. Many mornings I skip the lotion after I shower because I&#x27;m rushing around to get ready for work. The spray makes moisturizing very easy and fast&lt;br /&gt;- non-greasy lotion. The lotion gets absorbed super fast so you can get dressed right away.&lt;br /&gt;- scent goes away after absorption. I prefer unscented products so even though this lotion has a nice if strong cocoa smell, it goes away right away&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- It doesn&#x27;t offer deep moisture. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you have dry skin, but it&#x27;s ok for normal skin. I use a different product in areas were my skin is dry as this lotion doesn&#x27;t work there for me</li>
            <li> This product has really changed how i view moisturizing.  Its really easy and there is no stickiness. My skin absorbs it  easily and i love how i my skin feels after words ! Will buy as soon as i run out !</li>
            <li> Im in love with the new spray and go!! I was able to try it for free through Influenster. It&#x27;s quick and easy and cuts your time in half! I&#x27;ve also entered The Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize!</li>
            <li> This is a product I have always wanted to try and I am so glad Influenster sent it in my Viva Vox Box! I fell in love with it immediately like I thought I would! It is non greasy just as it says on the front and it is moisturizing. I love that I donʻt have to spend a lot of time rubbing lotion in. I can just spray and go! The scent is nice too, it is soft and buttery. I have already recommended this product to my mom, relatives, and friends. It is a great product over all! This is something I will be purchasing regularly from now on. All my other lotions will stay on the shelf!  *I am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
            <li> What easier way to use this product, love it and will continue using it leaves my skin fresh and soft.</li>
            <li> I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes from influenster and Im entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.&lt;br /&gt;I love how i can feel my skin absorbing this spray on lotion as soon as it is applied. Its very easy to rub into your skin, takes less than a minute to moisturize your entire body. Vaseline has so stepped up and created a lotion that is fast and easy for people with busy on the go lifestyles. This lotion has a very delightful scent that has grown on me more and more with each use. My favorite feature of this product is that it doesn&#x27;t give my skin that oily/greasy feeling and my second favorite feature is the lock and open twist top. Overall im very pleased with Vaseline spray on lotion its perfect for this busy stay at home mom, convenience is key in my home. I have only one con and that is the price but im willing to spend the money because this product really works for me and my family. #Influenster #VivaVoxBox #SprayandGo</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the vaseline spray and go moisturizer! it moisturizes in seconds as advertised and does not leave a greasy or sticky feeling, it also leaves your skin silky smooth! I Recommend you buy this product!</li>
            <li> Best pricing I could find.</li>
            <li> This Vaseline Spray Cocoa Moisturizer feels good on the body,  you just spray and go, you can&#x60;t any better than this.</li>
            <li> Ladies, put on your big girl panties and use real lotion. Seriously, your skin will thank you time and time again.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion!  It&#x27;s so easy to use, leaves skin so soft yet not oily,  dries fast no waiting to dress.  I never used lotion because of the effort of applying,  but this is so easy i can even spray it onto my own back.  I have only used it 5 days and can already tell a big difference in the feel of my skin.  I got the Cocoa Radiant and the fragrance is very pleasant and lingers long after application.  If I could I&#x27;d give it 6 stars.</li>
            <li> I love this spray on moisturizer!  I use a heavier moisturizer on my legs at night, and then before getting dressed in the morning, I spray this on and rub it in a little.  It&#x27;s light enough that I can get dressed soon after, but it does help add moisture.  As the bottle says, spray it 4\\&quot; away from skin and it&#x27;ll go where you aim it (re another commenter who had a slippery floor afterward).  I&#x27;d get the cheaper version except that I love the cocoa scent in this.  (I like Palmer&#x27;s cocoa oil as the night-time lotion).  This product is a perfect secondary moisturizer, in addition to a heavier type overnight.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I was shocked how easily this went on. You literally spray it on and rub in in about a second and a half. The scent is fantastic as well. And the best part? It&#x27;s not sticky at all!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick use, I like all of these because I hate using the creams, this works for me after swimming</li>
            <li> I bought this the weekend and tried it...I love it.  I hate squeezing and pumping out lotion.  I can spray my legs and arms and be lotioned up in seconds....love this......highly recommend.  And it&#x27;s not greasy like lotion.</li>
            <li> love this.  So fast to apply.  Just a slight pleasant smell.  Great to grab and use during the day.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use not greasy at all and has a nice aroma to it, but it does not last all day. Good for the summer, but in the cold of winter you will need something more</li>
            <li> It is ok.  Smells nice. Dries quickly but results are nothing that would make me run out and buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this on the go moisturizer!  I apply it every morning and every night and my skin is so much happier with me!  I wouldn&#x27;t mind a bit of a stronger scent; however, in my office at work a few ladies have trouble with perfumes, body lotions, etc upsetting allergies.  I love that I can spray this all over and don&#x27;t have to worry that the scent will be offensive.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try and am now on my 2nd bottle! It works great. Great scent, not strong. Leaves a nice sheen on my skin too. Great go to for summer for me!</li>
            <li> I like this it does dry quick and feels like the creamy baby oil after it dries some loitions leaves you sticky feeling after you get hot. This doesn&#x27;t you can take a shower spray lotion rub it in get dress right after wards. I the smell of the coco. I do recommend this too any friend.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.  Absorbs into skin and does not leave a greasy feeling.  Will definitely purchase this product again.  My favorite is the Aloe Fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Good smell!&lt;br /&gt;Goes on just like they advertise it on TV.&lt;br /&gt;I like it!</li>
            <li> Just bought this at my local grocery store.  It&#x27;s a lot cheaper. So far I like it. I used it when I got out of the shower and yes, you do have to rub it in, but it doesn&#x27;t take as long as lotion and I my body feels moisturized. Not sticky</li>
            <li> I tried the product and it was very watery. It took a while to rub it on. Even the smell was like a mix of water and lotion.</li>
            <li> Did not get this on amazon but loved it so much i had to write a review. I normally hate body lotion because it takes forever to dry and is usually too oily but I LOVE this product! It really does dry fast and does not take much rubbing in at all. I think it smells good too. Would definately recommend this product over any body lotions.</li>
