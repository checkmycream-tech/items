            <li>This product is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>This is the BEST product I have ever used on my face!</li>
            <li>Since these have been discontinued, I was so happy to find these here at Amazon for $15/ea (four per pack) that I bought three packs of them!  </li>
            <li>excellent, refresh the skin and give you a glow</li>
            <li>These are excellent.  </li>
            <li>The results were very good.</li>
            <li>Plumps up 50+ skin beautifully.  </li>
            <li>To be fair with the mask, sheet masks (cloth masks) are aloways soaked in lotions to ensure it delivers the best result within 10 to 15 minutes</li>
            <li>It is a great product and it was recommended by a friend.  </li>
            <li>I am happy to say that after using these masks, I decided to try the Revitalift Day Cream and Miracle Blur, and OMG what a discovery - where have these been all my life??  </li>
            <li>I am very happy and want to buy more of it</li>
            <li>I always loved this now discontinued product.  </li>
            <li>It took me almost two months with exceptional amount of efforts to get my refund.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fun treat, and it works great, but don&#x27;t expect some magical lift or anything of that sort.  </li>
            <li>The best quick fix for your skin I have ever used, it really tightens and brightens your face in twenty minutes</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>The coolness also helps sinus pressure and headaches so afterwards I&#x27;m feeling so much better.</li>
            <li>I love it and will tell my friends</li>
            <li>If L&#x27;Oreal works for you as well as it does for me, you will love the product..</li>
            <li>Love that i was able to find this</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>i love most of l&#x27;oreal&#x27;s products and swear by their hair color.  </li>
            <li>my face felt \\&quot;tight\\&quot; but more like the feel i have when i go without moisturizer all together.</li>
            <li>i prefer a supple feel which is why the chemical peel and moisturizer probably work better for me</li>
            <li>I see here now that I can order the peel straight from this site which will be great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found a couple of boxes.</li>
            <li>Makes bath time refreshing.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product to use in the winter when your skin feels itchy and dry.</li>
            <li>I had used these  and thought they were great but was surprised when I saw a fellow traveler use one in flight.  </li>
            <li>it was such a wonderful, cool, soothing feeling on my face.  </li>
            <li>I truly LOVED this product and am VERY dissappointed I can no longer find it.</li>
            <li>i have tried the l&#x27;oreal advanced revitalift mask twice now</li>
            <li>and she told me it felt great in the dry cabin air.  </li>
            <li>These hard to find &amp;#34;masks&amp;#34; are great!</li>
            <li>so they&#x27;ll be cool when I apply.</li>
            <li>They work great, but they&#x27;re not worth</li>
            <li>I would not mind how the mask felt in regards to the wet washcloth sensation if i had a good outcome.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll post it in the right place.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, I think its a pretty good product</li>
            <li>and it will mostly feel cool and wet.</li>
            <li>you are ready to go!.</li>
            <li>I do a scrub first, then this mask and it really tightens my skin.  </li>
            <li>- i like the glow of fresh new skin and the reduction in surface tension i get with the post moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really find them anymore at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s too much work, so</li>
            <li>However, there was ABSOLUTELY a noticeable difference in my skin tone after each use -</li>
            <li>I had used different masks from expensive brands to homemade natural masks, and this is so far the mask that gives the most impressive results.</li>
            <li>I would love it if the mask extended a little more down the neck area.</li>
            <li>It made perfectly good sense and, as long as you don&#x27;t mind looking a bit odd for 10 minutes</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>50 years old with no visible wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a supposed time limit in the directions, but I leave them on until the material nearly dries out</li>
            <li>I purchased two boxes so that I can apply the mask daily for one week (4/pk) for intense treatment.</li>
            <li>So I won&#x27;t sing their praises too loud .</li>
            <li>Love these but they are becoming impossible to find .</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know whether or not I saw a decrease in wrinkles, and with only four masks I highly doubt there was.  </li>
            <li>I decided to use one of the masks the next morning, and WOW</li>
            <li>there are other things in this line i much prefer.</li>
            <li>It will give you a hydrating/tightening kick for a few hours, that&#x27;s for certain.  </li>
            <li>I live in Florida and the my skin takes a beating due to the heat.</li>

            <li> I live in Florida and the my skin takes a beating due to the heat.</li>
            <li> I have friends who save the extra lotion to make one mask into two by using a mask sheet that comes in a ball as small as a penny, once it&#x27;s soaked in the lotion it swells and is ready to put on the face.</li>
            <li> I used it a long time ago and felt instant results.  </li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel tight after its use and hydrates it completely.</li>
            <li> -- however long it will cling to my face.  </li>
            <li> At Target or Walgreens and other stores, the actual selling price is 19.99 and  I have seen it for 16.99 ..    </li>
            <li> I have big pores on my face due to the oily skin type I have, and I have been looking for products that claimed to minimize my pores.</li>
            <li> Ya just can&#x27;t go wrong with the tried and true.</li>
            <li> The only (small) complaint that I have is that the mask is not that large.</li>
            <li> But once a month hardly makes me a regular, so I can&#x27;t vouch for long-term effects with regular use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m so sad this isn&#x27;t being made anymore, and hope I can find something comparable in the near future.  </li>
            <li> Usually by the time I wake up, it is dry and my skin feels so touchable.</li>
            <li> I was rummaging under my bathroom sink a few weeks ago and ran across a box of these masks -</li>
            <li> with this product i do not like the cold wet feeling of the mask on my face - i generally prefer a warming sensation with any mask product.  </li>
            <li> I have had a hard time finding their chemical peel over the last few months at my local drug stores and ULTA salons and was afraid it had been discontinued</li>
            <li> After using produdtions for my acne, my skin was dry and tired.</li>
            <li> only use one maybe once a month, whenever a glance in the mirror makes me think I look exceptionally tired or ashen.  </li>
            <li> I almost hate to give this a glowing review as others may gobble up what little is left!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about with $50, they can&#x27;t be serious.  </li>
            <li> This feels like I have a cold wet washcloth slapped over my face.  </li>
            <li> They are my beauty secret.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care if it gives me a cold feelings to my face or not (actually it&#x27;s good because I am in Florida)</li>
            <li> I am sad to know that this product has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> To say the actual price is $50.00 is outrageous ..</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t look tired and blotchy - my skin literally came to life!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I had used these  and thought they were great but was surprised when I saw a fellow traveler use one in flight.  I commented that I had used this same mask at home and she told me it felt great in the dry cabin air.  It made perfectly good sense and, as long as you don&#x27;t mind looking a bit odd for 10 minutes or so I think you will like it also.  I am sad to know that this product has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal stopped making this last year.  This product is wonderful.  Plumps up 50+ skin beautifully.  Haven&#x27;t found a replacement yet.</li>
            <li> At Target or Walgreens and other stores, the actual selling price is 19.99 and  I have seen it for 16.99 ..    To say the actual price is $50.00 is outrageous ..</li>
            <li> I almost hate to give this a glowing review as others may gobble up what little is left! This is the BEST product I have ever used on my face! I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have a Rejuvenique Facial exerciser by Linda Evans. You can&#x27;t really find them anymore at a reasonable price. I put one of the Loreal masks on and then put on the facial exerciser for about 30 minutes! Wow! What a team those two make.  They are my beauty secret. 50 years old with no visible wrinkles.  Loreal needs to keep making this product!</li>
            <li> Since these have been discontinued, I was so happy to find these here at Amazon for $15/ea (four per pack) that I bought three packs of them!  Don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about with $50, they can&#x27;t be serious.  They work great, but they&#x27;re not worth THAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use one maybe once a month, whenever a glance in the mirror makes me think I look exceptionally tired or ashen.  There&#x27;s a supposed time limit in the directions, but I leave them on until the material nearly dries out -- however long it will cling to my face.  (And there&#x27;s plenty of left-over goo to rub about the neck and chest, etc.)  It&#x27;s a fun treat, and it works great, but don&#x27;t expect some magical lift or anything of that sort.  It will give you a hydrating/tightening kick for a few hours, that&#x27;s for certain.  But once a month hardly makes me a regular, so I can&#x27;t vouch for long-term effects with regular use.</li>
            <li> I purchased two boxes so that I can apply the mask daily for one week (4/pk) for intense treatment. The results were very good. I have noticed my face getting tighter. I live in Florida and the my skin takes a beating due to the heat. I keep the masks in the refrigerator so they&#x27;ll be cool when I apply. The coolness also helps sinus pressure and headaches so afterwards I&#x27;m feeling so much better. The only (small) complaint that I have is that the mask is not that large. I would love it if the mask extended a little more down the neck area. Other than that, I think its a pretty good product and I&#x27;d definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and I miss having it in the store&#x27;s shelves. I know it has been discontinued but this has been my go to item anytime I wanted to relax. It makes your skin feel tight after its use and hydrates it completely. Wonderful product to use in the winter when your skin feels itchy and dry. What I do is I wash my face and put it on before I take a nap. Usually by the time I wake up, it is dry and my skin feels so touchable.</li>
            <li> It is a great product and it was recommended by a friend.  I love it and will tell my friends</li>
            <li> If L&#x27;Oreal works for you as well as it does for me, you will love the product.. Ya just can&#x27;t go wrong with the tried and true.</li>
            <li> In May, we made an order for 12 boxes and later decided to return this order. We followed through their return procedure and sent all 12 boxes untouched back immediately. However they claimed that they only received one box and made refund for one instead of 12. We eventually had to go through Amazon&#x27;s A-Z Guarantee Claim with mailing receipt and photos to proof my shipping was 12 instead of just one box. It took me almost two months with exceptional amount of efforts to get my refund. So I am not recommending this place.</li>
            <li> I got this at a low price in TJMax. After I removed the mask from my face after wearing it for 10 minutes, I was amazed to see the pores on my face shrunked dramatically and my skin looked so moist. After using produdtions for my acne, my skin was dry and tired. I had used different masks from expensive brands to homemade natural masks, and this is so far the mask that gives the most impressive results. I have big pores on my face due to the oily skin type I have, and I have been looking for products that claimed to minimize my pores. I used a box of this mask, twice a week and I found it improve the texture of my skin. I am very happy and want to buy more of it so I can continue. I don&#x27;t care if it gives me a cold feelings to my face or not (actually it&#x27;s good because I am in Florida), what I care is if it works. To be fair with the mask, sheet masks (cloth masks) are aloways soaked in lotions to ensure it delivers the best result within 10 to 15 minutes and it will mostly feel cool and wet. I have friends who save the extra lotion to make one mask into two by using a mask sheet that comes in a ball as small as a penny, once it&#x27;s soaked in the lotion it swells and is ready to put on the face. I can&#x27;t buy them here in USA and I think it&#x27;s too much work, so I just massage the extra lotion to my neck and hands.</li>
            <li> Love that i was able to find this</li>
            <li> I was rummaging under my bathroom sink a few weeks ago and ran across a box of these masks - totally forgot I had purchased them (like a year earlier!).  I decided to use one of the masks the next morning, and WOW it was such a wonderful, cool, soothing feeling on my face.  I used all four in two weeks - I was jonesing for the next mask! - and now have found that L&#x27;Oreal no longer makes them.  Boo. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know whether or not I saw a decrease in wrinkles, and with only four masks I highly doubt there was.  However, there was ABSOLUTELY a noticeable difference in my skin tone after each use - I didn&#x27;t look tired and blotchy - my skin literally came to life!  If I could afford it, I would use the mask on every part of my body - it just felt so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so sad this isn&#x27;t being made anymore, and hope I can find something comparable in the near future.  I am happy to say that after using these masks, I decided to try the Revitalift Day Cream and Miracle Blur, and OMG what a discovery - where have these been all my life??  But that&#x27;s a review for another product...I&#x27;ll post it in the right place.  What I will say, though, is that the Revitalift line has truly restored my faith in beauty products. :)</li>
            <li> excellent, refresh the skin and give you a glow</li>
            <li> i have tried the l&#x27;oreal advanced revitalift mask twice now and i find that i prefer their glycolic peel followed by the given moisturizer to follow.  i love most of l&#x27;oreal&#x27;s products and swear by their hair color.  with this product i do not like the cold wet feeling of the mask on my face - i generally prefer a warming sensation with any mask product.  This feels like I have a cold wet washcloth slapped over my face.  The mask does make my skin feel \\&quot;firmer\\&quot; i suppose.  my face felt \\&quot;tight\\&quot; but more like the feel i have when i go without moisturizer all together. i prefer a supple feel which is why the chemical peel and moisturizer probably work better for me - i like the glow of fresh new skin and the reduction in surface tension i get with the post moisturizer.  I have had a hard time finding their chemical peel over the last few months at my local drug stores and ULTA salons and was afraid it had been discontinued which is what made me give their mask product a try. I see here now that I can order the peel straight from this site which will be great. I would not mind how the mask felt in regards to the wet washcloth sensation if i had a good outcome.  for me it is just not what i am looking for in a product.  there are other things in this line i much prefer.</li>
            <li> These hard to find &amp;#34;masks&amp;#34; are great!</li>
            <li> The best quick fix for your skin I have ever used, it really tightens and brightens your face in twenty minutes you are ready to go!.</li>
            <li> I always loved this now discontinued product.  I&#x27;m glad I found a couple of boxes. Maybe L&#x27;Oreal will bring it back.</li>
            <li> Love these but they are becoming impossible to find . So I won&#x27;t sing their praises too loud . I don&#x27;t want others buying them up..😉</li>
            <li> These are excellent.  I do a scrub first, then this mask and it really tightens my skin.  Visible difference for me in my 60&#x27;s.  Been using this product for over 7 years now.</li>
            <li> been looking for this for years! I used it a long time ago and felt instant results.  Makes bath time refreshing.</li>
            <li> I truly LOVED this product and am VERY dissappointed I can no longer find it.</li>
