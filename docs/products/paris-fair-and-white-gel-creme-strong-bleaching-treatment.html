            <li>Very good buy and does fade marks fast.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m being honest :)</li>
            <li>It looks as if the top layer of skin was destroyed kind of like a chemical peel.  </li>

            <li>and I don&#x27;t think my face has ever been this free from freckles and sun spots, even since I was a kid!</li>
            <li>Someone goofed for sure.</li>
            <li>After about halfway through using the product, I noticed a clearer and more even complexion.</li>
            <li>Now i can wear cute shorts for summer.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>why took out one star :)</li>
            <li>THANKS FOR A GREAT PRODUCT..</li>
            <li>I tried many products to get rid of sun spots.  </li>
            <li>but i can see it removed most of it.  </li>
            <li>fred krueger see i just put two of my favorite movies together</li>
            <li>donot buy if u love your skin....</li>
            <li>If you use this creme you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>Not saying it was better than black&amp;white</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m vane and I love it.</li>
            <li>sure to use sun protection to protect your skin if using this product.</li>
            <li>I love it....</li>
            <li>used so many thinks also</li>
            <li>had to buy more since my friends had got some from me.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>make sure you exfoliate a day after to help change your color faster.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazingly potent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better on thicker skin.</li>
            <li>and now I can&#x27;t believe how even and smooth this has made my face!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m somewhat satisfied w/ the results.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and I have to say it&#x27;s the best facial cream I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>Great stuff really works if you have discoloration or acne scares</li>
            <li>It is better (out of experience) not to scrub the skin with scrubber during the time of using this product as it make the burning feeling more.</li>
            <li>As I kept using it I was able to keep up with occurring blemishes and have them under control too.</li>
            <li>Hopes this helps:)))</li>
            <li>On top of that the seller doesn&#x27;t list all of the ingredients in the bleach cream.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.  </li>
            <li>Because its becoming lighter, the sunken look diminishes as well (kinda how it would look if using concealer).</li>
            <li>And it works even better on a clean face,</li>
            <li>cause this stuff is strong).</li>
            <li>This product contains \\&quot;Hydroquinone-1.9&amp;\\&quot; which is strongly advised by doctors to avoid when deciding on a skin bleaching cream.</li>
            <li>If you use this you need to use a good moisterizer with high SPF and try to avoid the sun.</li>
            <li>Pretty amazing what this product can do.</li>
            <li>Actually pretty amazing</li>
            <li>thank you so much I will be ordering more!</li>
            <li>After using this product 2x a day for a week my friends and (of course) myself could tell a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Huge difference, and</li>
            <li>I continued for 4 weeks total with great results.</li>
            <li>i used it twice a day for 3 weeks and my severe acne scars have gotten so light.  </li>
            <li>Best if used more regularly than I have applied it, but sweating after application can lead to the product entering the eyes, so I will be applying it more regularly after the summer months.</li>
            <li>I would like to use it to light some brown spot on my face.</li>
            <li>I applied a light coat to each spot.</li>
            <li>My face looks great and younger!!!</li>
            <li>she gave me the waxing free since I didn&#x27;t need it, but</li>
            <li>and I used to be  light skinned</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s light skinned</li>
            <li>I use the fair and white gel along with the soap it work magical within a week</li>
            <li>I love All of Fair &amp; White Products.</li>
            <li>The Paris Fair &amp; White Strong Cream work best for me even clearing my dark spots.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff I am going to order another tube pretty soon.</li>
            <li>The first couple of weeks I wasn&#x27;t sure it was doing anything, just give it some time...</li>
            <li>and i see significant change..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought two more tubes since my first purchase.  </li>
            <li>and I also mixed this product with another product from the fair white line I am happy</li>
            <li>but the best way to test this product is to but the cream in a small part of where ever and wait</li>
            <li>I was excited about it with all the reviews</li>
            <li>You should begin to see results after first week then more after continued use.</li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>Many products out  there works up to a certain point and it stops working</li>
            <li>THE LARGE  BODY LOTION &amp;  MOST OF  ALL</li>
            <li>But I found clarisonic and using that brush with dr murad cleanser and this Paris white and fair creme</li>
            <li>Just received my 2 tubes of the Paris Fair &amp; White Gel Creme today.  </li>
            <li>I didint get as clear as I would of liked</li>
            <li>I really love it and is what I was really expecting.thanks a lot,love it.love the smell  too</li>
            <li>I have been using fair and white for two months and the marks are dramtically fading.</li>
            <li>so idk if that played a part in my fast results.i made sure to wear a spf 30 sunscreen whenever i was exposed to the sun</li>
            <li>It really works though, I love it.</li>
            <li>THE  \\&quot;FAIR &amp; WHITE  GEL ~</li>
            <li>~  \\&quot; FAIR &amp; WHITE  GEL ~ CREAM \\&quot;  </li>
            <li>The age spots are lighter than before; they&#x27;d probably be much lighter if I used the gel more often.</li>
            <li>When it didn&#x27;t I ordered the Fair and White.</li>
            <li>I purchase here or the Fair &amp; White Site!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;College</li>
            <li>Official Fair and White products spell Cream as Creme....</li>
            <li>BUT ANY FAIR AND WHITE PRODUCTS FROM AMAZON...</li>
            <li>since I was 12 an nothing has ever worked besides Fair an White.</li>
            <li>The National Library of Medicine states these are ingredients used to lighten melasma and that is good enough for me.</li>
            <li>First - I thought I was ordering Fair &amp; White Gel Creme Strong Bleaching Treatment.  </li>
            <li>U can even add a dot to ur cleaning regiment as u scrub and clean with hot water, and u will see immediate results make sure u keep up with cleaning your face because peeling happens and u must gently exfoliate to smooth the process.</li>
            <li>great product for dark spots on face.</li>
            <li>After I ran my first tube of xtreme brite, I ordered this cream alone with Fair &amp; White Exclusive Gel Creme Whitenizer .</li>
            <li>I do notice a major difference with this product than those sold at your walgreens type of store, it is very strong, but i do notice a difference</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!!</li>
            <li>You just have to be consistent !</li>
            <li>I experienced some itching on my skin and little burn feeling after some time of applying.</li>
            <li>DRASTICALLY it went from covering my lip and part of my cheek to the size of my finger tip, and that much is almost so light</li>
            <li>your not going to get anything better for this cheap that actually works ,\\&quot; cheapos\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Totally worth</li>
            <li>I love this product only after a week i saw significant noticable results.</li>
            <li>It is super greasy but Im willing to deal with that for results like this.</li>
            <li>so I returned the package right away.</li>
            <li>This cream came right on time.</li>
            <li>all right</li>
            <li>My wife uses this mixed with a similar product to maintain her beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>not sure if it works yet, but shipping was great</li>
            <li>i bought two tubes and iam bearly on the first one and woow worth every penny</li>
            <li>Whenever I see or whenever I feel any kind of stubble on my chin, I get the tweezers and start grabbing those hairs, now, because I&#x27;ve done this for so long (15 years)</li>
            <li>So easy to use - Q-tip it directly onto problem</li>
            <li>After you rub into skin, get you some cocoa butter or some kind of oil to put on so your skin won&#x27;t look dry.</li>
            <li>This one seems to light my face reasonable fast.</li>
            <li>I received this product super fast.</li>
            <li>BUY FROM FAIR AND WHITE DIRECT...</li>
            <li>Thought this product is very strong, the results are very well worth the brief moment of skin peeling!</li>
            <li>I am extremely satisfies with the results I&#x27;m getting from this powerful and effective cream.</li>
            <li>You will need a good exfoliating soap after the first few days of use.</li>
            <li>First off the product was expired</li>
            <li>its even better with a solid skincare regimen that contains retinol.</li>
            <li>Much better price than the local store.</li>
            <li>The package directions suggest twice daily, but I applied it once and was pleased with the outcome.</li>
            <li>Be sure to get the cream PRECISELY on the dark spot, though, or it&#x27;ll lighten the surrounding area, too.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe that something that cost just over $6 could do so much!  </li>
            <li>First of all this is not made by yves st laurent .</li>
            <li>I used the creme the first time.</li>
            <li>I actually thought it worked better.</li>
            <li>this is my second time using it love it</li>
            <li>It is very itchy that causes me to have skin rashes!</li>
            <li>I applied on it my legs first just to see if there is any effect.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately no change at all.</li>
            <li>but changed for the better the cream got my color back.</li>
            <li>I was first septical about this product</li>
            <li>This product is great but the shipping was TURTLE SLOW.</li>
            <li>SCARS ARE  REALLY FADING  AWAY !  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much !</li>
            <li>(next time i will be more thorough when applying this for a balanced skin tone</li>
            <li>This was not my first purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the spots will come back if I get any sun.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been about 4 days and the circles are still red and prominent.  </li>
            <li>I know they are different and will take more time to go</li>
            <li>I have melasma from hypothyroid and more than likely hormonal issues.  </li>
            <li>what a big difference my husband love it.  </li>
            <li>I used it first for my spots, abd under eye darkness by using a q-tip to apply dots and rub them in.</li>
            <li>It works with hot water.</li>
            <li>well, it moisturizes good, but then my face feels oily and greasy after a few hours.</li>
            <li>The product does not have a strong smell (barely notice).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had two larger than quarter size bright red circles on my face where I had put the creme.  </li>
            <li>Or at least for months at a time:) u can even use this on the body with hot water and a loofa!!!</li>
            <li>Is a bit invasive and harsh, best if not used with other products.</li>
            <li>are pretty much gone.  </li>
            <li>Got the order fast and it was exactly as it was ordered.</li>
            <li>Which is what I pretty much wanted.  </li>
            <li>and I developed a mild rash from it.</li>
            <li>i had alot of sun damage,but it was to strong or something i made my face red all day</li>
            <li>Now because it is so strong, I am only using it one to two times a week.</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t strong enough on targeted area</li>
            <li>Hey, everything doesn&#x27;t work for everyone and this certainly did nothing for me.</li>
            <li>so i really don&#x27;t know if it works well since i never used it long enough to see potentially good results.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve seen such a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I am just really upset.</li>
            <li>I sound like a commercial</li>
            <li>In my opinion this cream is much cheaper and safer than laser therapy, chemical peels, or surgery.  </li>
            <li>It really workds</li>
            <li>I will not buy again from here and am very dissapointed in the way they handled my case.</li>
            <li>I just expected better results.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitvie skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Latina with a honey beige color, very oily, I always have blackheads, pimples, brown spots, etc.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>it really fading away....</li>
            <li>wanted lightend.i wash and use an exfoliater and noticed it really helped to speed things up</li>
            <li>I really like this product and it does work.  </li>
            <li>Also I notice a difference in my skin much clearer</li>
            <li>This product works really well</li>
            <li>Instead of Intense bleaching treatment, I received a tube of Cream Gel Brighten Treatment...</li>
            <li>but it did not peel as much as i would have wanted.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>please answer, thanks so much</li>
            <li>I can walk into a nail salon without someone yelling you need a wax in front of the whole place.</li>
            <li>I thought that this bleacher was going to be and absolute on pore on target skin whitening kit</li>
            <li>could not tell after a month if it really worked.  </li>
            <li>I really could not tell much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>this cream work very well  </li>
            <li>I have span  so much money going to do cosmetic and nothing works until  </li>
            <li>thanks  to fairs and whitebleaching cream</li>
            <li>Real results will occur.</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing for my skin except burn it and make me peel.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe using the Fair &amp; White Gel Creme would take care of two very small red spots on my right cheek that are kind of like old scars.  </li>
            <li>the only thing I didint like is that it makes u peel other than that it&#x27;s a good product..</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews about this product and the price being so little, I was more than willing to take the chance.  </li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t until further research that I found out that this is NOT the original &amp;#34;Fair &amp; White&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Also make sure with using any type of bleaching cream to use a sunscreen as well or the dark spots will not lighten as much as they should.</li>
            <li>I love this because I had dark blemishes on my checks and forehead and corners of my lips and this cream has lightened it up.</li>
            <li>I got my true complexion back.  </li>
            <li>but it defenetly is better than before I use it on my face for dark lil spots</li>
            <li>My face--4 weeks later is a little better after healing and special treatment.     </li>
            <li>If it irritates less, you can try 1 part treatment to 1.5 part lotion, anything more than this will have zero bleaching effect on your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am African American and my face has a more even tone.  </li>
            <li>I tried many more expensive products that did not work as well.</li>
            <li>but I highly doubt it.</li>
            <li>I  HIGHLY  </li>
            <li>Helped clear up the huge birth mark on my right thigh and all the dark areas on my butt.</li>
            <li>Cleared my black spots and left my face looking clear and bright.</li>
            <li>my 2nd tube &amp; I love this stuff makes skins so even &amp; clear but it will dry it at first til you get used to it</li>
            <li>Do not use too much it can be a bit drying if your skin is sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I used the Paris Fair &amp; White line in the past</li>
            <li>If you still want to try it, wait for the rush to go away, then start off with 1 part Bleaching Treatment to 1 part normal moisturize lotion.</li>
            <li>I use it on my spots and they&#x27;ve peeled off and my skin looks so even and my normal tone.</li>
            <li>It might work better in less sensitive areas, but have yet to try.</li>
            <li>not, my chin is almost back to its right color.</li>
            <li>But a new lighter, brighter skin was revealed.  </li>
            <li>I want my skin to slough and peel, so the new skin and hopefully non-melasma skin will be underneath.  </li>
            <li>and I applied it for the first time that same evening.</li>
            <li>OMG  WOW !  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s normal, natural complexion.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>But wow!</li>
            <li>The first bleaching creme I&#x27;ve ever used that actually works!</li>
            <li>Firstly, it made my skin red like sunburn, which is what chemical peels do.  </li>
            <li>I tried this cream along with the Concha Nacar de pPerlop Natural Bleach Cream and it&#x27;s all gone!</li>
            <li>This stuff really works on dark marks and overall complexion very quickly .</li>
            <li>This product INSTANTLY BURNED my skin upon proper application, and I had to wash it off and splash cool water on my face for awhile.</li>
            <li>This us better than Ambi, Black &amp; White ointment, and the rest of those products.</li>
            <li>The cream is much easier to apply than make-up and it offers a lasting solution.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the gel , will be looking  to order different products.</li>
            <li>In the past i have tried multiple products used for lightening dark spots and freckles that are available in most stores and have seen no results.</li>
            <li>but  no results so far.</li>
            <li>Do not use near the eyes.</li>
            <li>I am 47 years old</li>
            <li>My skin is not that sensitive, but after using this product for 2 consecutive days I had to stop it.</li>
            <li>This works very well, within days noticed a big difference in the spots</li>
            <li>I wake up and WOW</li>
            <li>I would consider purchasing again once I complete the remaining creme.</li>
            <li>IF YOU HAD  A PROFESSIONAL  CHEMICAL  PEEL , PERFORMED  ON YOUR  SKIN  ....</li>
            <li>I reordered to see if it would work on old scars...discolorations.</li>
            <li>My skin soft</li>
            <li>I thought my skin would eventually return to its natural color.</li>
            <li>And as far as lightening</li>
            <li>I feel completely out of myself when I&#x27;m like this  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely using this stuff for the rest of my life..</li>
            <li>Only down side to ths item is that it seems strong</li>
            <li>My skin is very fair and sensitive and generally if I react badly to something, it goes away in a couple of days.  </li>
            <li>I was left with many little blister-like bumps for days!</li>
            <li>my skin is free of discolorations under eye circles even though they were not that dark if they were it would work with daily use.</li>
            <li>My skin first showed big red spots on each finger.</li>
            <li>But to my surprise my second order was so different from my first order.</li>
            <li>Totally satified with this soap and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>She and I both have normal skin, so I guess it&#x27;s just different from person to person.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;VE recently decided to take back my lady part and seek pure PERFECTION.</li>
            <li>I used this on my face and all it really did was dry it out.</li>
            <li>It will turn red if you use too much and sometimes white</li>
            <li>I am very glad I tried this product even if the dark spots don&#x27;t go at least now</li>
            <li>I believe I received a fake product of Fair &amp; White...</li>
            <li>I HAD A MAJOR  SURGERY  </li>
            <li>I bought it to lighten my scars which are not very dark to begin with and wanted to bring the scars closer to my skin color.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for the consistency of the gel (it&#x27;s a little greasy), but it&#x27;s worth looking over that.</li>
            <li>so I clean my face and throw the cream out a few days later the skin on my nostril literally bleeding and burnt off</li>
            <li>Oh, and a little goes a long way fortunately.</li>
            <li>Cheap product,doesn&#x27;t nothing at all, at least didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>Product lasts a long time, you don&#x27;t need much unless you are trying to lighten a larger area.</li>
            <li>So far it has been working , and I have been using it for last 1 year.</li>
            <li>With consistent use, it removes blemishes on my face and dark spots on my elbows.  </li>
            <li>they are barely there..  </li>
            <li>I am in my early 40s and Asian.</li>
            <li>My dark patches on my face are fading fast and I had burned my self on my leg where it scared me and the scare is almost gone. !</li>
            <li>Anyway, the first night I dabbed it on the dark spots.</li>
            <li>It really works, however be careful about putting  it on your face it could leave you with blotches.</li>
            <li>Be careful and apply to spots only because it will lighten up too much if your not careful..</li>
            <li>This stuff really works my belly was darker than any other part of my body and  since a just had my baby and have stretch marks..</li>
            <li>then when they dissapeared I started to lighten my entire face to even my tone, and it totally worked within a week, but in a month I was a shade lighter and almost completely even.</li>
            <li>African American female with old acne scars, that have been cleared up!</li>
            <li>Ok so when I ordered this I ordered it for 2 reasons I have 2 dark spots that nothing has been able to remove and a bad pregnancy mask mark on my upper lip and cheek, all these are on the left side of my face and I am just down right tired of people laughing saying my left side looks 10 years older then my right.</li>
            <li>It really cleared the dark spot on my chin in 5 days.</li>
            <li>I had some pretty dark acne scarring and a few age spots that are creeping on, and it really worked on the scarring.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read some negative reviews saying this cream burns the face an leaves it dry , I haven&#x27;t experienced any of that other than a little dryness</li>
            <li>I use it every night for a whole month now, the brown spots on my face seem less noticeable.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I used this to lighten dark marks left from mosquito bites on my legs but it ran out so fast .</li>
            <li>first uses made me red but after that is was pale complexion  </li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying I&#x27;ve only been using this cream for THREE days an my ance marks (black spots) on my face are completely gone !!!</li>
            <li>I am an African American female with a mocha complextion and I have tried so many creams and products in the past; Ambi, Black Soap etc but nothing worked until now!</li>
            <li>Even on the hands and nuckles use with scrub and hot water, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Seemed lighter in certain spots if it fades better later on I will repurchase as it doesn&#x27;t burn skin or feel that bad while using.</li>
            <li>I am white and have suffered from dark eye circles since high school.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still working on a couple of spots around my jawline, but other than that my face looks very clear and even toned.  </li>
            <li>Cant tell nothing bad but nothing good.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Someone goofed for sure.</li>
            <li> After about halfway through using the product, I noticed a clearer and more even complexion.</li>

            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> why took out one star :)</li>
            <li> THANKS FOR A GREAT PRODUCT..</li>
            <li> I tried many products to get rid of sun spots.  </li>
            <li> but i can see it removed most of it.  </li>
            <li> fred krueger see i just put two of my favorite movies together</li>
            <li> donot buy if u love your skin....</li>
            <li> If you use this creme you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> Not saying it was better than black&amp;white</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m vane and I love it.</li>
            <li> sure to use sun protection to protect your skin if using this product.</li>
            <li> I love it....</li>
            <li> used so many thinks also</li>
            <li> had to buy more since my friends had got some from me.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> make sure you exfoliate a day after to help change your color faster.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazingly potent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better on thicker skin.</li>
            <li> and now I can&#x27;t believe how even and smooth this has made my face!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m somewhat satisfied w/ the results.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> and I have to say it&#x27;s the best facial cream I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Great stuff really works if you have discoloration or acne scares</li>
            <li> It is better (out of experience) not to scrub the skin with scrubber during the time of using this product as it make the burning feeling more.</li>
            <li> As I kept using it I was able to keep up with occurring blemishes and have them under control too.</li>
            <li> Hopes this helps:)))</li>
            <li> On top of that the seller doesn&#x27;t list all of the ingredients in the bleach cream.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.  </li>
            <li> Because its becoming lighter, the sunken look diminishes as well (kinda how it would look if using concealer).</li>
            <li> And it works even better on a clean face,</li>
            <li> cause this stuff is strong).</li>
            <li> This product contains \\&quot;Hydroquinone-1.9&amp;\\&quot; which is strongly advised by doctors to avoid when deciding on a skin bleaching cream.</li>
            <li> If you use this you need to use a good moisterizer with high SPF and try to avoid the sun.</li>
            <li> Pretty amazing what this product can do.</li>
            <li> Actually pretty amazing</li>
            <li> thank you so much I will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> After using this product 2x a day for a week my friends and (of course) myself could tell a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Huge difference, and</li>
            <li> I continued for 4 weeks total with great results.</li>
            <li> i used it twice a day for 3 weeks and my severe acne scars have gotten so light.  </li>
            <li> Best if used more regularly than I have applied it, but sweating after application can lead to the product entering the eyes, so I will be applying it more regularly after the summer months.</li>
            <li> I would like to use it to light some brown spot on my face.</li>
            <li> I applied a light coat to each spot.</li>
            <li> My face looks great and younger!!!</li>
            <li> she gave me the waxing free since I didn&#x27;t need it, but</li>
            <li> and I used to be  light skinned</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s light skinned</li>
            <li> I use the fair and white gel along with the soap it work magical within a week</li>
            <li> I love All of Fair &amp; White Products.</li>
            <li> The Paris Fair &amp; White Strong Cream work best for me even clearing my dark spots.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff I am going to order another tube pretty soon.</li>
            <li> The first couple of weeks I wasn&#x27;t sure it was doing anything, just give it some time...</li>
            <li> and i see significant change..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought two more tubes since my first purchase.  </li>
            <li> and I also mixed this product with another product from the fair white line I am happy</li>
            <li> but the best way to test this product is to but the cream in a small part of where ever and wait</li>
            <li> I was excited about it with all the reviews</li>
            <li> You should begin to see results after first week then more after continued use.</li>
            <li> Worth the price!</li>
            <li> Many products out  there works up to a certain point and it stops working</li>
            <li> THE LARGE  BODY LOTION &amp;  MOST OF  ALL</li>
            <li> But I found clarisonic and using that brush with dr murad cleanser and this Paris white and fair creme</li>
            <li> Just received my 2 tubes of the Paris Fair &amp; White Gel Creme today.  </li>
            <li> I didint get as clear as I would of liked</li>
            <li> I really love it and is what I was really expecting.thanks a lot,love it.love the smell  too</li>
            <li> I have been using fair and white for two months and the marks are dramtically fading.</li>
            <li> so idk if that played a part in my fast results.i made sure to wear a spf 30 sunscreen whenever i was exposed to the sun</li>
            <li> It really works though, I love it.</li>
            <li> THE  \\&quot;FAIR &amp; WHITE  GEL ~</li>
            <li> ~  \\&quot; FAIR &amp; WHITE  GEL ~ CREAM \\&quot;  </li>
            <li> The age spots are lighter than before; they&#x27;d probably be much lighter if I used the gel more often.</li>
            <li> When it didn&#x27;t I ordered the Fair and White.</li>
            <li> I purchase here or the Fair &amp; White Site!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;College</li>
            <li> Official Fair and White products spell Cream as Creme....</li>
            <li> BUT ANY FAIR AND WHITE PRODUCTS FROM AMAZON...</li>
            <li> since I was 12 an nothing has ever worked besides Fair an White.</li>
            <li> The National Library of Medicine states these are ingredients used to lighten melasma and that is good enough for me.</li>
            <li> First - I thought I was ordering Fair &amp; White Gel Creme Strong Bleaching Treatment.  </li>
            <li> U can even add a dot to ur cleaning regiment as u scrub and clean with hot water, and u will see immediate results make sure u keep up with cleaning your face because peeling happens and u must gently exfoliate to smooth the process.</li>
            <li> great product for dark spots on face.</li>
            <li> After I ran my first tube of xtreme brite, I ordered this cream alone with Fair &amp; White Exclusive Gel Creme Whitenizer .</li>
            <li> I do notice a major difference with this product than those sold at your walgreens type of store, it is very strong, but i do notice a difference</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!!</li>
            <li> You just have to be consistent !</li>
            <li> I experienced some itching on my skin and little burn feeling after some time of applying.</li>
            <li> DRASTICALLY it went from covering my lip and part of my cheek to the size of my finger tip, and that much is almost so light</li>
            <li> your not going to get anything better for this cheap that actually works ,\\&quot; cheapos\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Totally worth</li>
            <li> I love this product only after a week i saw significant noticable results.</li>
            <li> It is super greasy but Im willing to deal with that for results like this.</li>
            <li> so I returned the package right away.</li>
            <li> This cream came right on time.</li>
            <li> all right</li>
            <li> My wife uses this mixed with a similar product to maintain her beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> not sure if it works yet, but shipping was great</li>
            <li> i bought two tubes and iam bearly on the first one and woow worth every penny</li>
            <li> Whenever I see or whenever I feel any kind of stubble on my chin, I get the tweezers and start grabbing those hairs, now, because I&#x27;ve done this for so long (15 years)</li>
            <li> So easy to use - Q-tip it directly onto problem</li>
            <li> After you rub into skin, get you some cocoa butter or some kind of oil to put on so your skin won&#x27;t look dry.</li>
            <li> This one seems to light my face reasonable fast.</li>
            <li> I received this product super fast.</li>
            <li> BUY FROM FAIR AND WHITE DIRECT...</li>
            <li> Thought this product is very strong, the results are very well worth the brief moment of skin peeling!</li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfies with the results I&#x27;m getting from this powerful and effective cream.</li>
            <li> You will need a good exfoliating soap after the first few days of use.</li>
            <li> First off the product was expired</li>
            <li> its even better with a solid skincare regimen that contains retinol.</li>
            <li> Much better price than the local store.</li>
            <li> The package directions suggest twice daily, but I applied it once and was pleased with the outcome.</li>
            <li> Be sure to get the cream PRECISELY on the dark spot, though, or it&#x27;ll lighten the surrounding area, too.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that something that cost just over $6 could do so much!  </li>
            <li> First of all this is not made by yves st laurent .</li>
            <li> I used the creme the first time.</li>
            <li> I actually thought it worked better.</li>
            <li> this is my second time using it love it</li>
            <li> It is very itchy that causes me to have skin rashes!</li>
            <li> I applied on it my legs first just to see if there is any effect.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately no change at all.</li>
            <li> but changed for the better the cream got my color back.</li>
            <li> I was first septical about this product</li>
            <li> This product is great but the shipping was TURTLE SLOW.</li>
            <li> SCARS ARE  REALLY FADING  AWAY !  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much !</li>
            <li> (next time i will be more thorough when applying this for a balanced skin tone</li>
            <li> This was not my first purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the spots will come back if I get any sun.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about 4 days and the circles are still red and prominent.  </li>
            <li> I know they are different and will take more time to go</li>
            <li> I have melasma from hypothyroid and more than likely hormonal issues.  </li>
            <li> what a big difference my husband love it.  </li>
            <li> I used it first for my spots, abd under eye darkness by using a q-tip to apply dots and rub them in.</li>
            <li> It works with hot water.</li>
            <li> well, it moisturizes good, but then my face feels oily and greasy after a few hours.</li>
            <li> The product does not have a strong smell (barely notice).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had two larger than quarter size bright red circles on my face where I had put the creme.  </li>
            <li> Or at least for months at a time:) u can even use this on the body with hot water and a loofa!!!</li>
            <li> Is a bit invasive and harsh, best if not used with other products.</li>
            <li> are pretty much gone.  </li>
            <li> Got the order fast and it was exactly as it was ordered.</li>
            <li> Which is what I pretty much wanted.  </li>
            <li> and I developed a mild rash from it.</li>
            <li> i had alot of sun damage,but it was to strong or something i made my face red all day</li>
            <li> Now because it is so strong, I am only using it one to two times a week.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t strong enough on targeted area</li>
            <li> Hey, everything doesn&#x27;t work for everyone and this certainly did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> so i really don&#x27;t know if it works well since i never used it long enough to see potentially good results.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve seen such a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I am just really upset.</li>
            <li> I sound like a commercial</li>
            <li> In my opinion this cream is much cheaper and safer than laser therapy, chemical peels, or surgery.  </li>
            <li> It really workds</li>
            <li> I will not buy again from here and am very dissapointed in the way they handled my case.</li>
            <li> I just expected better results.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitvie skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Latina with a honey beige color, very oily, I always have blackheads, pimples, brown spots, etc.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li> This is the real deal.</li>
            <li> it really fading away....</li>
            <li> wanted lightend.i wash and use an exfoliater and noticed it really helped to speed things up</li>
            <li> I really like this product and it does work.  </li>
            <li> Also I notice a difference in my skin much clearer</li>
            <li> This product works really well</li>
            <li> Instead of Intense bleaching treatment, I received a tube of Cream Gel Brighten Treatment...</li>
            <li> but it did not peel as much as i would have wanted.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> please answer, thanks so much</li>
            <li> I can walk into a nail salon without someone yelling you need a wax in front of the whole place.</li>
            <li> I thought that this bleacher was going to be and absolute on pore on target skin whitening kit</li>
            <li> could not tell after a month if it really worked.  </li>
            <li> I really could not tell much of a difference.  </li>
            <li> this cream work very well  </li>
            <li> I have span  so much money going to do cosmetic and nothing works until  </li>
            <li> thanks  to fairs and whitebleaching cream</li>
            <li> Real results will occur.</li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing for my skin except burn it and make me peel.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe using the Fair &amp; White Gel Creme would take care of two very small red spots on my right cheek that are kind of like old scars.  </li>
            <li> the only thing I didint like is that it makes u peel other than that it&#x27;s a good product..</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews about this product and the price being so little, I was more than willing to take the chance.  </li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t until further research that I found out that this is NOT the original &amp;#34;Fair &amp; White&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Also make sure with using any type of bleaching cream to use a sunscreen as well or the dark spots will not lighten as much as they should.</li>
            <li> I love this because I had dark blemishes on my checks and forehead and corners of my lips and this cream has lightened it up.</li>
            <li> I got my true complexion back.  </li>
            <li> but it defenetly is better than before I use it on my face for dark lil spots</li>
            <li> My face--4 weeks later is a little better after healing and special treatment.     </li>
            <li> If it irritates less, you can try 1 part treatment to 1.5 part lotion, anything more than this will have zero bleaching effect on your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am African American and my face has a more even tone.  </li>
            <li> I tried many more expensive products that did not work as well.</li>
            <li> but I highly doubt it.</li>
            <li> I  HIGHLY  </li>
            <li> Helped clear up the huge birth mark on my right thigh and all the dark areas on my butt.</li>
            <li> Cleared my black spots and left my face looking clear and bright.</li>
            <li> my 2nd tube &amp; I love this stuff makes skins so even &amp; clear but it will dry it at first til you get used to it</li>
            <li> Do not use too much it can be a bit drying if your skin is sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I used the Paris Fair &amp; White line in the past</li>
            <li> If you still want to try it, wait for the rush to go away, then start off with 1 part Bleaching Treatment to 1 part normal moisturize lotion.</li>
            <li> I use it on my spots and they&#x27;ve peeled off and my skin looks so even and my normal tone.</li>
            <li> It might work better in less sensitive areas, but have yet to try.</li>
            <li> not, my chin is almost back to its right color.</li>
            <li> But a new lighter, brighter skin was revealed.  </li>
            <li> I want my skin to slough and peel, so the new skin and hopefully non-melasma skin will be underneath.  </li>
            <li> and I applied it for the first time that same evening.</li>
            <li> OMG  WOW !  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s normal, natural complexion.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> But wow!</li>
            <li> The first bleaching creme I&#x27;ve ever used that actually works!</li>
            <li> Firstly, it made my skin red like sunburn, which is what chemical peels do.  </li>
            <li> I tried this cream along with the Concha Nacar de pPerlop Natural Bleach Cream and it&#x27;s all gone!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works on dark marks and overall complexion very quickly .</li>
            <li> This product INSTANTLY BURNED my skin upon proper application, and I had to wash it off and splash cool water on my face for awhile.</li>
            <li> This us better than Ambi, Black &amp; White ointment, and the rest of those products.</li>
            <li> The cream is much easier to apply than make-up and it offers a lasting solution.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the gel , will be looking  to order different products.</li>
            <li> In the past i have tried multiple products used for lightening dark spots and freckles that are available in most stores and have seen no results.</li>
            <li> but  no results so far.</li>
            <li> Do not use near the eyes.</li>
            <li> I am 47 years old</li>
            <li> My skin is not that sensitive, but after using this product for 2 consecutive days I had to stop it.</li>
            <li> This works very well, within days noticed a big difference in the spots</li>
            <li> I wake up and WOW</li>
            <li> I would consider purchasing again once I complete the remaining creme.</li>
            <li> IF YOU HAD  A PROFESSIONAL  CHEMICAL  PEEL , PERFORMED  ON YOUR  SKIN  ....</li>
            <li> I reordered to see if it would work on old scars...discolorations.</li>
            <li> My skin soft</li>
            <li> I thought my skin would eventually return to its natural color.</li>
            <li> And as far as lightening</li>
            <li> I feel completely out of myself when I&#x27;m like this  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely using this stuff for the rest of my life..</li>
            <li> Only down side to ths item is that it seems strong</li>
            <li> My skin is very fair and sensitive and generally if I react badly to something, it goes away in a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> I was left with many little blister-like bumps for days!</li>
            <li> my skin is free of discolorations under eye circles even though they were not that dark if they were it would work with daily use.</li>
            <li> My skin first showed big red spots on each finger.</li>
            <li> But to my surprise my second order was so different from my first order.</li>
            <li> Totally satified with this soap and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> She and I both have normal skin, so I guess it&#x27;s just different from person to person.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;VE recently decided to take back my lady part and seek pure PERFECTION.</li>
            <li> I used this on my face and all it really did was dry it out.</li>
            <li> It will turn red if you use too much and sometimes white</li>
            <li> I am very glad I tried this product even if the dark spots don&#x27;t go at least now</li>
            <li> I believe I received a fake product of Fair &amp; White...</li>
            <li> I HAD A MAJOR  SURGERY  </li>
            <li> I bought it to lighten my scars which are not very dark to begin with and wanted to bring the scars closer to my skin color.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the consistency of the gel (it&#x27;s a little greasy), but it&#x27;s worth looking over that.</li>
            <li> so I clean my face and throw the cream out a few days later the skin on my nostril literally bleeding and burnt off</li>
            <li> Oh, and a little goes a long way fortunately.</li>
            <li> Cheap product,doesn&#x27;t nothing at all, at least didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Product lasts a long time, you don&#x27;t need much unless you are trying to lighten a larger area.</li>
            <li> So far it has been working , and I have been using it for last 1 year.</li>
            <li> With consistent use, it removes blemishes on my face and dark spots on my elbows.  </li>
            <li> they are barely there..  </li>
            <li> I am in my early 40s and Asian.</li>
            <li> My dark patches on my face are fading fast and I had burned my self on my leg where it scared me and the scare is almost gone. !</li>
            <li> Anyway, the first night I dabbed it on the dark spots.</li>
            <li> It really works, however be careful about putting  it on your face it could leave you with blotches.</li>
            <li> Be careful and apply to spots only because it will lighten up too much if your not careful..</li>
            <li> This stuff really works my belly was darker than any other part of my body and  since a just had my baby and have stretch marks..</li>
            <li> then when they dissapeared I started to lighten my entire face to even my tone, and it totally worked within a week, but in a month I was a shade lighter and almost completely even.</li>
            <li> African American female with old acne scars, that have been cleared up!</li>
            <li> Ok so when I ordered this I ordered it for 2 reasons I have 2 dark spots that nothing has been able to remove and a bad pregnancy mask mark on my upper lip and cheek, all these are on the left side of my face and I am just down right tired of people laughing saying my left side looks 10 years older then my right.</li>
            <li> It really cleared the dark spot on my chin in 5 days.</li>
            <li> I had some pretty dark acne scarring and a few age spots that are creeping on, and it really worked on the scarring.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some negative reviews saying this cream burns the face an leaves it dry , I haven&#x27;t experienced any of that other than a little dryness</li>
            <li> I use it every night for a whole month now, the brown spots on my face seem less noticeable.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I used this to lighten dark marks left from mosquito bites on my legs but it ran out so fast .</li>
            <li> first uses made me red but after that is was pale complexion  </li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying I&#x27;ve only been using this cream for THREE days an my ance marks (black spots) on my face are completely gone !!!</li>
            <li> I am an African American female with a mocha complextion and I have tried so many creams and products in the past; Ambi, Black Soap etc but nothing worked until now!</li>
            <li> Even on the hands and nuckles use with scrub and hot water, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Seemed lighter in certain spots if it fades better later on I will repurchase as it doesn&#x27;t burn skin or feel that bad while using.</li>
            <li> I am white and have suffered from dark eye circles since high school.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still working on a couple of spots around my jawline, but other than that my face looks very clear and even toned.  </li>
            <li> Cant tell nothing bad but nothing good.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t advise mixing this with other face creams, especially if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have been using this product twice a day for about two weeks and the dark circles are almost completely gone!  </li>
            <li> After using it for two weeks the dark spot was completely gone!</li>
            <li> so I thought this product could have helped clear out the dark area in my skin since it is a bleaching creme</li>
            <li> I thought that this product was for your whole body but ONE its way to small</li>
            <li> Has cleared up my small blemishes and is working really well on my melasma.</li>
            <li> I purchased this gel cream to fade some dark spots on my face from old breakouts.</li>
            <li> I made this purchase hoping that it would lighten the dark spots, and my skin is not very dark , but this did not work.  </li>
            <li> most importantly I desperately wanted to improve my skin condition.</li>
            <li> It has does wonders clearing up the dark spots on my skin in such a short period of time.</li>
            <li> You have to use for a long time before you see results.</li>
            <li> This takes a long time to work.</li>
            <li> The cream is slightly greasy and it does peel the skin a little but not too much.</li>
            <li> I looked in the mirror and the places I had applied the cream were now super dark burns, I tried washing my face with a gentle soap, but it burned like crazy.</li>
            <li> but I did want to warn anyone with pale, sensitive skin that if they are thinking of resolving a problem spot they should probably look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I did read the reviews about the item containing hydroquinone, but I wasn&#x27;t worried about that because I&#x27;ve used other products with 2% hydroquinone before and this one only had 1.9%.</li>
            <li> so I then put a little on my nostril where my nose ring left a old black sore</li>
            <li> It did dry out my skin</li>
            <li> On the flip side, it does not live up to it&#x27;s claims.</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;I am a Brown Skin African American and for YEARS i suffered from dark bikin scars all over my \\&quot;area\\&quot; due to shaving!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I conventionally didn&#x27;t attend dermatology schools or religious school&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I have some dark spots in my face left by acne</li>
            <li> Having had dark spots on my back and chest for years and years I didn&#x27;t think anything could help.</li>
            <li> The reason why I have not giving 5 stars is because I&#x27;ve only been using it about 2 weeks and my dark spot hasn&#x27;t completly disapeared</li>
            <li> I have two dark noticeable spots on my chin from constantly picking and tweeting.</li>
            <li> I had ingrown hair and had really dark skin around my beard area and sideburns and this actually got rid of it.</li>
            <li> Not only are my dark stretch markc gone</li>
            <li> and I used this product to remove dark spots on my back which was created from acne.</li>
            <li> The IPL treatments had made my dark spots even darker and I tried everything possible.</li>
            <li> I have used this like directed for only 3 days twice a day on the 2 dark spots and pregnancy mask mark.</li>
            <li> I had a noticeable dark spot above my lip from either waxing it or a dermatologist told me being on birth control can cause it as well.</li>
            <li> Same quality of the brand i purchased previously.</li>
            <li> I then asked please for an exchange for some healing cream for my face or something of equal or less value...</li>
            <li> I am black female.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to black &amp; white fade creme .</li>
            <li> I used black&amp; white didn&#x27;t want to change change not look</li>
            <li> less than TWO WEEKS!&lt;br /&gt;I will update later!</li>
            <li> No more need for heavy cover-creams; regular liquid foundation works for me and my skin is beautifuly clear.</li>
            <li> I tried this product last night and when i woke up it looked a little sun burned or as if i had a chemical peel done.</li>
            <li> I have 3 different shades of skin brown Carmel and very dark brown</li>
            <li> I truly wish I didnt waste my money and by the way I got it like 3 weeks later! .</li>
            <li> I felt as if i had nothing to lose having spent hundreds of dollars trying everything thing under the sun.</li>
            <li> i still will use it for another few weeks and then occasionally to even skin tone out.</li>
            <li> I spent hundreds of dollars on laser treatments and fade creams with no results.</li>
            <li> No REAL concerns to report.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a whitening cream and bought this cream few weeks back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Extremely careful stay away from sun&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li> I had dark mark for long time on my face .I</li>
            <li> i wonder how white a person can get if used this everyday for a year</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for 5 days and the few blemishes that I had</li>
            <li> So I expected results, and results I got.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually does work, unlike other bleach creams I&#x27;ve tried for a little birthmark.  </li>
            <li> If you apply daily you will see results for lightening dark spots in a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> A few days later the spots had turned really, really dark.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Extreme brightening gel..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pretty expensive, it cost $100 for one treatment.</li>
            <li> so be very careful</li>
            <li> Later on in the evening my red cheeks became swollen , the following morning I developed a hard bump on each cheek where I had applied the cream it itches and burns like crazy.   </li>
            <li> On line information does not indicate Hydroqunoine is the active ingredient.</li>
            <li> Later on at work I noticed my cheeks started turning red, I immediately knew I had some sort of reaction to the the cream but didn&#x27;t expect for it to get worse.....</li>
            <li> I tried this product for dark pigmentation on my upper lip and small area on my face.</li>
            <li> I am brown skinned, not dark, and now my face is 4 shade darker then my body, and its not a good dark, it looks burnt.. will not recomm</li>
            <li> Contacted the seller asking please for a refund and stating something is not right with this product.</li>
            <li> I have medium toned caucasian skin that is not very sensitive usually.</li>
            <li> I bought it thinking it will fade some dark spots.</li>

            <li> I have the dark, sunken in look under the eyes.</li>
            <li> Within a couple of days the dark spots started to lighten.</li>
            <li> My dark spots are almost completly faded my hoo hah</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s evening or my skin tone and getting rid of the dark spots.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s simply not worth</li>
            <li> were my skin done got dark.</li>
            <li> it just dont let it get in ur eyes when applying around for dark circles</li>
            <li> I was so desperate to get rid of these super dark areas on my face and nothing worked at all!</li>
            <li> It has already taken the pregnancy mask mark down</li>
            <li> THIS  SKIN BLEACHING  TREATMENT FOR  OTHER WOMEN OF  COLOR !</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t make a slight difference.</li>
            <li> i am black and i have the complextion of keri hilson or aaliyah</li>
            <li> Slight burning and redness after application, but the sensation fades.</li>
            <li> and I saw a slight improvement.</li>
            <li> had radiation forhead and skin was black.</li>
            <li> an a half hrs ago</li>
            <li> In less than a week my skin has returned to</li>
            <li> Although it helped bleached some scars of mine SLIGHTLY, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> I put a little on a dark blemish on my chin and goes to sleep</li>
            <li> unfortunately I was away and dissapointed with this product that I had high hopes for.</li>
            <li> This is not a Fair &amp; White product...</li>
            <li> i think the medicine made me a little bipolar J/K to the subject</li>
            <li> When I woke up, my face felt tight in those areas.</li>
            <li> and and super bad melasma from lupus scars, acne, and everything else.</li>
            <li> in the begining it causes a little irritation until your skin becomes use to it.  </li>
            <li> Somehow, it doesn&#x27;t have any effect on me, not even have a little redness.</li>
            <li> Seems like my underarms are getting lighter little by little.</li>
            <li> I rate this one star because it did not work even a little bit.</li>
            <li> My only critique is a GEL formulation would be less irritating to acne prone skin like mine.</li>
            <li> there are just a few little dark marks that still need time to fade!</li>
            <li> I have this product since last year, but I only use it for flea&#x27; bite scars on my feet, it does peeling and clear out a bit, but the dry skin peeling is seriously disgusting looking.</li>
            <li> Since, I spent my hard earn money on it and</li>
            <li> I wasted my money on this product.</li>
            <li> I used this creme for 5 days and my skin got dried and peeled.</li>
            <li> using this for another few months would fix my face</li>
            <li> It takes a few weeks until you gradually realize the darkening around mouth and nose are gone.</li>
            <li> I use the cream twice a day everyday.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I felt like my name shouldve been drop dead</li>
            <li> THE SKIN GETS  LIGHTER &amp; BRIGHTER, THE SKIN MAY  EVEN PEEL ,,,,, ALL THE DEAD SKIN  </li>
            <li> a few hrs then wash and see the difference between</li>
            <li> But when I use it, it causes irritation on my skin after few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a few weeks now</li>
            <li> There should be a law against this...it could be something in this stuff that will destroy your face...  </li>
            <li> In my opinion it was a waste of 8 dollars.</li>
            <li> My skin is a mess!</li>
            <li> Have been using for two months, with very little improvement to hyper pigmentation.</li>
            <li> Waste of Money do not buy this product !</li>
            <li> I mix it with lotion and dont put anymore then a small bit.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;ve seen small results.</li>
            <li> over the past 20 years</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I got tired of fighting with one woman one day and told her fine wax it, after she did she saw the mark was there, she then told me my face very dirty</li>
            <li> Very harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> if your tired of a flaw like pregnancy mask try this I will write another review in a couple weeks about the dark spots</li>
            <li> so start of slow with a small amount and work ur way up in the amount u apply.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper, easier and less painful!</li>
            <li> Recently, they had gotten so bad that a stranger asked me how I got two black eyes.  </li>
            <li> but it is hard to see.</li>
            <li> The company is so rude</li>
            <li> I do not like writing negative reviews</li>
            <li> irritation, even in delicate area&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> due to usage of a wrong exfoliating face wash face for about 2months became 5 shades darker than the body ..</li>
            <li> Pay a little and expect the same results :(</li>
            <li> I mean almost 25% lighter grade of color of my skin in 4 days.</li>
            <li> Subtle changes, slowly.</li>
            <li> I seriously wanted to cry</li>
            <li> Not good for my skin type</li>
            <li> the following morning after I received this terrible product I applied two dabs on the sides of my cheek where I had two dark spots.</li>
            <li> I have a black marks from chicken pox and bug bites.</li>
            <li> Very slow process, but worked&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced any irritations or side effects and it works almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I am returning this product for false advertisement...</li>
            <li> I suffered from boils in the past on the backs of my thighs and once they were lanced they left horrible scars</li>
            <li> It does lighten some areas but not as dramatic.</li>
            <li> u will start knowing this is working when u start feel the tingle from the cream, i will take about an hr to and hr and a half to experience this tingle(not necisarly painful feeling</li>
            <li> Now I merely use it occasionaly for maintenance.</li>
            <li> i was unable to figure out why it was happening</li>
            <li> I only used this product once and it made my skin worst.</li>
            <li> Seriously?!!</li>
            <li> Now I must deal with returning this product since I didn&#x27;t want to use the dangerous substance.  </li>
            <li> this product is freakin dangerous</li>
            <li> Hydroquinone is extremely dangerous and may lead to the development of cancer.</li>
            <li> The tube is tinyyyyy, it looked and smelled  like it went bad, but I didnt check which is my fault.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s how the product suppose to look like, but after reading all the reviews on here I decided to give it a shot, the product looked like a bad mixture, I couldn&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li> BAD  </li>
            <li> I got this to try and lighten a really bad forehead scar from a chemical peel.</li>
            <li> this gives you an idea how bad and embarrassing my mark was.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from really bad ance</li>
            <li> This purchase disappointed me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed and will not be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> annoying.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I have always had very bad skin.</li>
            <li> they hide this in ingredient description, hydroquinone is very bad for your skin and destroys skins rejuvanating capacity.</li>
            <li> It was very, very painful.</li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed !</li>
            <li> I  HAD  VERY UGLY TERRIBLE  </li>
            <li> I HAD horrible acne scarring and darkening of my face.</li>

            <li> it was disgusting and my husband kept calling me freddy krueger..</li>
            <li> I was probably terribly allergic to something in the creme</li>
            <li> My pregnancy mask was sooooo horrible make up didn&#x27;t cover it and</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works miracle for me. Clearin uup my spots</li>
            <li> On line information does not indicate Hydroqunoine is the active ingredient. I am allergic to the chemical so I returned the package right away. However, I have not been refunded my money yet and it is almost a month now.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for skin bleaching. I&#x27;ve never experienced any irritations or side effects and it works almost immediately.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!! I saw results in a week of use!! Thought this product is very strong, the results are very well worth the brief moment of skin peeling! You will need a good exfoliating soap after the first few days of use. Very good buy and does fade marks fast.</li>
            <li> Never again from what I remember ...it was no changing results nothing ...Waste of Money do not buy this product !</li>
            <li> I have never been so impressed with a product , used for vanity purpose. If you can tolerate ( that is no allergy) , it will work. For initial 1 month, I applied twice a day. In the beginning it feels oily but that oiliness disappears in 30 minutes. After 1 month I reduced it to once a day. In addition, I use sun screen 1/2 hour before I go out. So far it has been working , and I have been using it for last 1 year.</li>
            <li> This product suckss!!!!! I bought it thinking it will fade some dark spots.First off the product was expired (I didnt see that till I was done using it). The tube is tinyyyyy, it looked and smelled  like it went bad, but I didnt check which is my fault. I am just really upset. The reason that it didnt help me at all could have been cause it was expired but I highly doubt it. I truly wish I didnt waste my money and by the way I got it like 3 weeks later! .</li>
            <li> This creme didnt work for me I saw no change when i used this creme I wasted my money on this product. The company is so rude</li>
            <li> Works great, better than what I can find in the stores. Thanks for the gel , will be looking  to order different products.</li>
            <li> I received my cream via mail on June 18, 2013 and I applied it for the first time that same evening. Since then I have applied it twice daily, morning and night and I have seen results after only a week! (Today is June 26, 2013) I suffered from boils in the past on the backs of my thighs and once they were lanced they left horrible scars well I definently notice that the scars have gotten noticeably lighter and a bit smoother. I also use on my elbows and knees. This cream has not caused me any irritation: redness, itching etc. I love this stuff I am going to order another tube pretty soon. I am an African American female with a mocha complextion and I have tried so many creams and products in the past; Ambi, Black Soap etc but nothing worked until now! I sound like a commercial but I&#x27;m being honest :)</li>
            <li> I see the differends already and it has only been three weeks.</li>
            <li> This cream  removes the outer layer  of your skin by  removing damage skin but it is not helpful in improving complexion.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after doing a great deal of research. (i am aware of the risks associated with hydroquinone and moreover the excessive or misuse of it) I felt as if i had nothing to lose having spent hundreds of dollars trying everything thing under the sun. I HAD horrible acne scarring and darkening of my face. After using this product 2x a day for a week my friends and (of course) myself could tell a huge difference. I continued for 4 weeks total with great results. A little goes a long way. It is super greasy but Im willing to deal with that for results like this. I now only use it when i have a scar and put it on at night for about a week. WORKS WONDERS! *its even better with a solid skincare regimen that contains retinol.</li>
            <li> Very harsh on my skin. People say youre supposed to use sunscreen  along with it so that your face wont peel, but I didn&#x27;t even go out in the sun; applied it to my discoloration spots and it still literally had face peeling! Ive even applied sunscreen the second time i used it and it almost burned my face off. I was mortified. I will NEVER recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> the following morning after I received this terrible product I applied two dabs on the sides of my cheek where I had two dark spots. Later on at work I noticed my cheeks started turning red, I immediately knew I had some sort of reaction to the the cream but didn&#x27;t expect for it to get worse..... Well it did. Later on in the evening my red cheeks became swollen , the following morning I developed a hard bump on each cheek where I had applied the cream it itches and burns like crazy.   I am now currently on day three experiencing the aftermath it is 6:21 am and i cant sleep. Please please think three times before buying this garbage.</li>
            <li> Much better price than the local store. Same quality of the brand i purchased previously. Will order from this site again to save on items</li>
            <li> I am white and have suffered from dark eye circles since high school.  Recently, they had gotten so bad that a stranger asked me how I got two black eyes.  I have been using this product twice a day for about two weeks and the dark circles are almost completely gone!  In my opinion this cream is much cheaper and safer than laser therapy, chemical peels, or surgery.  The cream is much easier to apply than make-up and it offers a lasting solution.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. With consistent use, it removes blemishes on my face and dark spots on my elbows.  However, when I discontinue use, the blemishes on my elbows return.  So I have to use it fairly regularly even when the marks have disappeared!</li>
            <li> This is the product I had been seeking. After 3weeks brown spots are gone. No more need for heavy cover-creams; regular liquid foundation works for me and my skin is beautifuly clear. It does have 2% hydroquinone, but I had no reaction; no burning,redness, hyper-pigmentation, flaking...So easy to use - Q-tip it directly onto problem area(s) after evening cleansing and go to sleep. The package directions suggest twice daily, but I applied it once and was pleased with the outcome. Now I merely use it occasionaly for maintenance.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s how the product suppose to look like, but after reading all the reviews on here I decided to give it a shot, the product looked like a bad mixture, I couldn&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li> very good product my skin is free of discolorations under eye circles even though they were not that dark if they were it would work with daily use. s.  I will always have this on hand..  Do not use too much it can be a bit drying if your skin is sensitive.  Work your way up to maximum use.  they also have a spot treatment in this brand on amazon I love as well.  This is the best place and price to find it also...</li>
            <li> after using this product for 3 weeks, i must say i love it.  in the begining it causes a little irritation until your skin becomes use to it.  It really workds i used it twice a day for 3 weeks and my severe acne scars have gotten so light.  they are barely there..  i still will use it for another few weeks and then occasionally to even skin tone out.</li>
            <li> I dont know... I used this on my face and all it really did was dry it out. so meh did not work for me</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see no different</li>
            <li> In the past i have tried multiple products used for lightening dark spots and freckles that are available in most stores and have seen no results. I tried this product last night and when i woke up it looked a little sun burned or as if i had a chemical peel done. I have medium toned caucasian skin that is not very sensitive usually. I have had problems with acne scars and freckles all my life. I do notice a major difference with this product than those sold at your walgreens type of store, it is very strong, but i do notice a difference and i think i&#x27;ve finally found a product that works.</li>
            <li> Lovely and effective!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll make this short. I ordered this product, on the 7th of June, got it the 17th . Opened the box and it was hair growth oil ... annoying. I emailed them, they responded ASAP asking for my order number. I responded 2 minutes later and sent my order number and havent heard from them in 2 days. I emailed them again. The 4th day, they finally responded asking for pictures as proof ? Seriously?!! , I said no problem, and sent them two pictures. They sent a email apologizing for the mistake and refunded my money... did I ask for a refund? No. I just wanted the correct product. I will never order from them again for wasting my time.</li>
            <li> ilove this creme it clean your skin very good about two week .it good men and woman my wife love it</li>
            <li> This stuff actually does work, unlike other bleach creams I&#x27;ve tried for a little birthmark.  Be sure to get the cream PRECISELY on the dark spot, though, or it&#x27;ll lighten the surrounding area, too.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for dark pigmentation on my upper lip and small area on my face. This product INSTANTLY BURNED my skin upon proper application, and I had to wash it off and splash cool water on my face for awhile. Then apply a pack as it felt like my face was on fire. I was left with many little blister-like bumps for days! I was mortified. Contacted the seller asking please for a refund and stating something is not right with this product. I was denied with no concern for my condition. I then asked please for an exchange for some healing cream for my face or something of equal or less value...I was told &#x27;no one else has had complaints like you&#x27; and that was it! I will not buy again from here and am very dissapointed in the way they handled my case. I only wanted to work it out.  My face--4 weeks later is a little better after healing and special treatment.     I do not like writing negative reviews but I wish I want to help out someone else if I can.</li>
            <li> Great product, lightened my elbows when nothing else seemed to work.</li>
            <li> Now I must deal with returning this product since I didn&#x27;t want to use the dangerous substance.  That should be against the law to leave out the ingredient in advertising.</li>
            <li> I love this because I had dark blemishes on my checks and forehead and corners of my lips and this cream has lightened it up. I am African American and my face has a more even tone.  Its been a month and I see good results.  I got my true complexion back.  I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.  I recommend this and I will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> I am african american and hypergimentation has always been an issue. I had a very nasty scar from a burn I got because of my acne medicine. The cream is slightly greasy and it does peel the skin a little but not too much. After using it for two weeks the dark spot was completely gone! It will turn red if you use too much and sometimes white so be very careful but it isn&#x27;t that noticeable. IT WORKS!</li>
            <li> I anticipate better results when I purchased and used this product. I just expected better results.</li>
            <li> I started using xtreme Brite soap and cream to fix my facial skin pigment and underarms. After I ran my first tube of xtreme brite, I ordered this cream alone with Fair &amp; White Exclusive Gel Creme Whitenizer . I have been using this cream religious but  no results so far.Cheap product,doesn&#x27;t nothing at all, at least didn&#x27;t work for me. Since, I spent my hard earn money on it and most importantly I desperately wanted to improve my skin condition. I did everything In my power to make this product work but I didn&#x27;t make a slight difference.</li>
            <li> Have been using this only for 4 days, applying twice a day as recommended and I have already seen a difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No irritation, even in delicate area&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely buy again once this tube is done for occasional maintenance.</li>
            <li> It turn my underarms color. I would not recommend this at all. I had to stop using it becuase it just did not work with my skin. I have very sensitvie skin maybe thats why. Would not recomment this product.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I have always had very bad skin. I&#x27;m Latina with a honey beige color, very oily, I always have blackheads, pimples, brown spots, etc. My skin is a mess! To the point I didn&#x27;t know how I could face anyone so I quit dating. But I found clarisonic and using that brush with dr murad cleanser and this Paris white and fair creme my complexion is nearly flawless!  I used this creme for 5 days and my skin got dried and peeled. But a new lighter, brighter skin was revealed.  I don&#x27;t even need makeup. I love this stuff!  Do not use near the eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had freckles and after growing up spending all of my summers at the lake I have a lot of sun damage, as well.  I have tried several products, even perscriptions, costing hundreds of dollars.  And, none of them worked.  After reading the reviews about this product and the price being so little, I was more than willing to take the chance.  Well, I&#x27;m certainly glad that I did!  I have been using this product for just over a month.  I am 47 years old and I don&#x27;t think my face has ever been this free from freckles and sun spots, even since I was a kid! I can&#x27;t believe that something that cost just over $6 could do so much!  I&#x27;m still working on a couple of spots around my jawline, but other than that my face looks very clear and even toned.  I would highly recommend this product!  The first couple of weeks I wasn&#x27;t sure it was doing anything, just give it some time...you WILL see results! Happy fading!!</li>
            <li> i am black and i have the complextion of keri hilson or aaliyah and i have dark scrars from exzema and acne and this product got rid of the scars in about 2 weeks and all the scar are gone and i stil used this to brighten my complextion it exfoliated and its like when the skin peels it peels u a shade lighter!!!</li>
            <li> My skin is not that sensitive, but after using this product for 2 consecutive days I had to stop it. My face had red patches like it was  burned. It also had a greasy texture. I would not recommend or buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Just received my 2 tubes of the Paris Fair &amp; White Gel Creme today.  I see the ingredients on this page is not matching the ingredients on the box.  Someone goofed for sure. I used the Paris Fair &amp; White line in the past so I know what to expect.  I will be getting some soaps as well.  This is the time of year (Fall/Winter) to work on evening that skintone for the Spring &amp; Summer!  Don&#x27;t forget your sunscreen!!!</li>
            <li> this product caused my skin to burn and peel. i applied at night and covered the areas well, but i still burneded. i recommend this product for winter use only</li>
            <li> if you like a greasy cream, this should be a good option for you, but i could not use it on my face since it was too greasy compared to what I&#x27;m used to. I used it on my hands for a week, and I think I did notice some difference, so I guess it does work, but don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll continue buying this product just because of the texture.</li>
            <li> Gave me a rash all over my face no color change at all my skin did peel though so idk</li>
            <li> received this product . First of all this is not made by yves st laurent . Secondly this contains 1.9 percent hydroquinone. This was not mentioned by the advertisers . they hide this in ingredient description, hydroquinone is very bad for your skin and destroys skins rejuvanating capacity. I hope amazon resolves these issues and removes thisitem from this site</li>
            <li> Is a bit invasive and harsh, best if not used with other products. Slight burning and redness after application, but the sensation fades. After about halfway through using the product, I noticed a clearer and more even complexion. Best if used more regularly than I have applied it, but sweating after application can lead to the product entering the eyes, so I will be applying it more regularly after the summer months.</li>
            <li> You have to use for a long time before you see results. Overall it did work didn&#x27;t completly take away my mark but it is hard to see.</li>
            <li> messed my face up i wouldn&#x27;t buy it again i don&#x27;t know because i used it correctly but then it looked like i had a sun burn.</li>
            <li> I used the creme the first time. I actually thought it worked better.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. Helped clear up the huge birth mark on my right thigh and all the dark areas on my butt. I used it with. Extreme brightening gel..and it worked great. The brightening gel exfoliates and this product whitens. Its incredible. Now i can wear cute shorts for summer. Imagine for 24 years i have lived with a horrible scar and now its finally gone .what more can i say. :-)</li>
            <li> It  used this product for 2 months  for my dark underarms it works but u have to be patient I didint get as clear as I would of liked but it defenetly is better than before I use it on my face for dark lil spots and I love it the only thing I didint like is that it makes u peel other than that it&#x27;s a good product..</li>
            <li> due to usage of a wrong exfoliating face wash face for about 2months became 5 shades darker than the body ..i was unable to figure out why it was happening but then i nailed it.Looked around to recover  from the damage caused and found this one.Used this for two weeks and i see significant change..using this for another few months would fix my face I guess. I wish this didnt have HA in it but it does thats why took out one star :)</li>
            <li> I really love it and is what I was really expecting.thanks a lot,love it.love the smell  too,i will keep on trying it to see the effect</li>
            <li> Received product on time I&#x27;m happy, I would order again.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Fast delivery product is wonderful this is my second time using it love it</li>
            <li> I need this product to lighten the dark son spot on my on my chin.  It takes time but it seems to be helpful and give some signs of results after short time using it.  Tks . seller.</li>
            <li> Works well as a face lightener. It takes a few weeks until you gradually realize the darkening around mouth and nose are gone. Product lasts a long time, you don&#x27;t need much unless you are trying to lighten a larger area. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I thought that this product was for your whole body but ONE its way to small and if i were to use it on my body it would be done in only 2-3 weeks and TWO on the back it just says apply to face. I have used it on my body for a week and than stopped because at that time i was just realizing that it says apply to face and not apply to face &amp; body. After that i applied it to my face for a week and than stopped so i really don&#x27;t know if it works well since i never used it long enough to see potentially good results.</li>
            <li> I am black female. I have a black marks from chicken pox and bug bites. I have have had hyperpigmentation for over 40 years. I have been using fair and white for two months and the marks are dramtically fading. I spent hundreds of dollars on laser treatments and fade creams with no results. I use the cream twice a day everyday. This is the real deal.</li>
            <li> EVERYONE always asks me what am i using on my face, my skin is clearer, younger looking and i been told that i have a glow on me. My boyfriend told me that i don&#x27;t need any makeup, because i have nice skin. he doesn&#x27;t know what iam using.....lol........THANKS FOR A GREAT PRODUCT..</li>
            <li> I can see good results after I started using it 2 weeks. My skin starts to peel which is good</li>
            <li> I use the fair and white gel along with the soap it work magical within a week I see the difference I have dark spit it really fading away....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Johanne L</li>
            <li> I made this purchase hoping that it would lighten the dark spots, and my skin is not very dark , but this did not work.  it wasn&#x27;t until further research that I found out that this is NOT the original &amp;#34;Fair &amp; White&amp;#34;.  I should have known, you get what you pay for.  Pay a little and expect the same results :(</li>
            <li> It makes my knees 3x darker! Yes, it did peel but it doesn&#x27;t make your skin whiter. It is very itchy that causes me to have skin rashes! Don&#x27;t buy this one!</li>
            <li> my 2nd tube &amp; I love this stuff makes skins so even &amp; clear but it will dry it at first til you get used to it</li>
            <li> I only used this product once and it made my skin worst. I have some dark spots in my face left by acne so I thought this product could have helped clear out the dark area in my skin since it is a bleaching creme but it made it worst. I only used it once but it did not help, the creme burned my skin instead and made the area a lot darker. I don&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Having had dark spots on my back and chest for years and years I didn&#x27;t think anything could help. But finally I found this product!  It&#x27;s a very strong bleaching treatment. Be careful and apply to spots only because it will lighten up too much if your not careful..</li>
            <li> This works very well, within days noticed a big difference in the spots wanted lightend.i wash and use an exfoliater and noticed it really helped to speed things up</li>
            <li> I used this twice a day with no exposure to sunlight and I saw a slight improvement. I used it under my arms and found that it had a nice scent and was very smooth but it did not do what it said.</li>
            <li> Brown spots have faded and I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple weeks. Huge difference, and it was inexpensive too.</li>
            <li> Um, didn&#x27;t give it enough time - just got scarier to continue to use. No REAL concerns to report.</li>
            <li> I tried many products to get rid of sun spots.  Many products out  there works up to a certain point and it stops working but this product goes beyond.  I&#x27;m impressed with the amount of money it cost and the working ability of this product.  The reason why I have not giving 5 stars is because I&#x27;ve only been using it about 2 weeks and my dark spot hasn&#x27;t completly disapeared but i can see it removed most of it.  It did dry out my skin but you can reverse that by using cream on your face.  Pretty amazing what this product can do.</li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfies with the results I&#x27;m getting from this powerful and effective cream. I am what is considered a &amp;#34;picker&amp;#34;. Whenever I see or whenever I feel any kind of stubble on my chin, I get the tweezers and start grabbing those hairs, now, because I&#x27;ve done this for so long (15 years) I have messed my chin up. I have two dark noticeable spots on my chin from constantly picking and tweeting. When I read the reviews of this cream I decided to give it a try. I started using about 2 weeks ago and I kid u not, my chin is almost back to its right color. This cream came right on time. I made 50 on the 7th of this month, and didn&#x27;t want to have those dark spots on my face. We&#x27;ll I believe by the end of this month, my face will look great. One thing I have to mention. After you rub into skin, get you some cocoa butter or some kind of oil to put on so your skin won&#x27;t look dry. This us better than Ambi, Black &amp; White ointment, and the rest of those products. Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed !</li>
            <li> This stuff really works on dark marks and overall complexion very quickly . Actually pretty amazing</li>
            <li> great product for dark spots on face.</li>
            <li> I love this product only after a week i saw significant noticable results. I did use this product twice a day morning and night,i also use kojic aid soap (which is a lightening soap) before applying it at night so idk if that played a part in my fast results.i made sure to wear a spf 30 sunscreen whenever i was exposed to the sun and i also didnt wear makeup.</li>
            <li> broke my skin out. Had to stop using</li>
            <li> I was looking for a whitening cream and bought this cream few weeks back. I applied on it my legs first just to see if there is any effect. Unfortunately no change at all. So I will not anyway allpy this on my face. It&#x27;s just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I used now for 2 week, I dont see any different</li>
            <li> It got to my address way before it said it was which is a good thing and I saw results within maybe two weeks</li>
            <li> I really like this product and it does work.  If you apply daily you will see results for lightening dark spots in a few weeks.  Great product at a great price.  I tried many more expensive products that did not work as well.</li>
            <li> Does not do what it says</li>
            <li> O.K. this product is freakin dangerous all right you wanna know i dont care im gonna tell u anyway look the 1st day I used it I put a little on a dark blemish on my chin and goes to sleep I wake up and WOW the blemish is kinda clearing so I then put a little on my nostril where my nose ring left a old black sore so about a hour around my nose start to itch i scratched then itchy again and i scratched it should have not did that so i go to the bathroom i look like rudolph the big nose clown because it swelling my nostril and my nose was extremely red so I clean my face and throw the cream out a few days later the skin on my nostril literally bleeding and burnt off it was disgusting and my husband kept calling me freddy krueger.. I seriously wanted to cry I felt like my name shouldve been drop dead fred krueger see i just put two of my favorite movies together i think the medicine made me a little bipolar J/K to the subject donot buy if u love your skin....</li>
            <li> It is one of the best products I have ever used for my acne, would recommend.  Really great and utilizable, easy to carry around, wear under makeup.  Hey, go for it, it is a winner.</li>
            <li> This takes a long time to work. It does lighten some areas but not as dramatic.</li>
            <li> Because it was the only one that worked for me. The rest did not work for me at all.thank u</li>
            <li> Didnt work for me will not purchase again</li>
            <li> I was introduced to black &amp; white fade creme . had radiation forhead and skin was black.I used black&amp; white didn&#x27;t want to change change not look just wanted my color back. but changed for the better the cream got my color back. Use as directed.after month use. going to see the results. my Mother complimented me she always would buy cremes coca butter.If you use this creme you&#x27;ll love it. you will use it again. because of the way it left my skin thought it was to greasy but goes on that way but when it dries you see the works it does. Not saying it was better than black&amp;white okay but if you want results use it one month. and see. you judge it. you will see. I&#x27;m vane and I love it.</li>
            <li> Happy with purchase. Great product.</li>
            <li> first uses made me red but after that is was pale complexion  like i want</li>
            <li> Subtle changes, slowly. I would consider purchasing again once I complete the remaining creme.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this bleaching cream!!  It has does wonders clearing up the dark spots on my skin in such a short period of time. I&#x27;ve bought two more tubes since my first purchase.  Also make sure with using any type of bleaching cream to use a sunscreen as well or the dark spots will not lighten as much as they should.</li>
            <li> my wife loves this stuff, she&#x27;s been using it forever</li>
            <li> Very slow process, but worked&lt;br /&gt;Extremely careful stay away from sun&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to use sun protection to protect your skin if using this product.</li>
            <li> Does nothing just peels on your skin and is too greasy also dries your skin out i dont recommend at all</li>
            <li> I am in my early 40s and Asian. I would like to use it to light some brown spot on my face. Somehow, it doesn&#x27;t have any effect on me, not even have a little redness.</li>
            <li> The Paris Fair &amp; White Strong Cream work best for me even clearing my dark spots. I like the results of this cream.</li>
            <li> Product works great and was shipped quick this is the best on the market because you can see the results and I also mixed this product with another product from the fair white line I am happy</li>
            <li> I was first septical about this product but when I started to use it, I saw a difference in my skin within 14 days.  My scares was fading away.  I love it....finally a product that works.</li>
            <li> I had dark mark for long time on my face .I used so many thinks also I did peeling but nothing help so that cream clean everything , friends tell me my face looking great and I&#x27;m so happy I don&#x27;t need  makeup&lt;br /&gt;That cream is miracle</li>
            <li> Great product. This product is great but the shipping was TURTLE SLOW. I&#x27;m currently deployed, I ended up going home for R/R, purchased it and brought it back with me. Recommended by a friend. It really works though, I love it. African American female with old acne scars, that have been cleared up!</li>

            <li> It totally removed a burn mark. I reordered to see if it would work on old scars...discolorations.</li>
            <li> I use along with my acne med. Clears skin leaving a flawless look. I have used for 3 years on my face</li>
            <li> this is amazing, i just used it on my forehead cause my forehead is darker than the rest of my face so i used it 2 an a half hrs ago and i had to go somewhere so i had to wash it instead of leaving it for 5 to 8 hrs and when i washed it ny forehead was matching the rest of my face and was whiter than spots that i didn&#x27;t apply the cream on my forehead (next time i will be more thorough when applying this for a balanced skin tone cause this stuff is strong). u will start knowing this is working when u start feel the tingle from the cream, i will take about an hr to and hr and a half to experience this tingle(not necisarly painful feeling but it feels a litle spicy, just like vicks) and that&#x27;s when u know its working. but the best way to test this product is to but the cream in a small part of where ever and wait a few hrs then wash and see the difference between then place u applied this stuff to the place u didn&#x27;t. i wonder how white a person can get if used this everyday for a year lol</li>
            <li> This product works really well but u need to only rub it on the spot u want lightened. It really cleared the dark spot on my chin in 5 days.</li>
            <li> It works so good that my friends tried it and bought thier own.&lt;br /&gt;I had to buy more since my friends had got some from me.&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure you exfoliate a day after to help change your color faster.</li>
            <li> I purchased this gel cream to fade some dark spots on my face from old breakouts. I did read the reviews about the item containing hydroquinone, but I wasn&#x27;t worried about that because I&#x27;ve used other products with 2% hydroquinone before and this one only had 1.9%. Anyway, the first night I dabbed it on the dark spots. When I woke up, my face felt tight in those areas. I thought that meant it was working. So I applied it again at night and when I woke up my face felt like it had been scraped off and doused with gasoline. I looked in the mirror and the places I had applied the cream were now super dark burns, I tried washing my face with a gentle soap, but it burned like crazy. The next couple of days, I didn&#x27;t even leave the house.It&#x27;s been almost a couple of weeks now and the burns are healing, but the spots are still there.</li>
            <li> This purchase disappointed me. I was excited about it with all the reviews but it just didnt work for me.</li>
            <li> No entend&amp;iacute; si realmente blanqueaba, la use para las axilas y codos, realmente quede en las mismas.&lt;br /&gt;Tal vez deba probar con otra marca.</li>
            <li> Not good for my skin type and I developed a mild rash from it. It might work better in less sensitive areas, but have yet to try.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazingly potent. I bought it for my under eye area initially. I have the dark, sunken in look under the eyes. Because its becoming lighter, the sunken look diminishes as well (kinda how it would look if using concealer). I&#x27;ve only been using it for 5 days and the few blemishes that I had are pretty much gone.  Paid $90 for some skin whitening face cream &amp; lotion from Europe and this cost like $8. The only reason I didn&#x27;t I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it took forever to get here. I will definitely buy it again; but hoping it ships faster next time. Oh, and a little goes a long way fortunately.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that in order for the product to work, you&#x27;ve got to remember to use it every.single.day. Sometimes, I forget. I had some pretty dark acne scarring and a few age spots that are creeping on, and it really worked on the scarring. The age spots are lighter than before; they&#x27;d probably be much lighter if I used the gel more often. I don&#x27;t care for the consistency of the gel (it&#x27;s a little greasy), but it&#x27;s worth looking over that.</li>
            <li> I used this to lighten dark marks left from mosquito bites on my legs but it ran out so fast . Such a tiny tube. But it works!!!</li>
            <li> This is works great on my sister. But when I use it, it causes irritation on my skin after few days. She and I both have normal skin, so I guess it&#x27;s just different from person to person. Anyway, I mix it with regular body lotion and it doesn&#x27;t irritate anymore. I tried 1:1, not so good, 1:1.5 is the best for me. I use it every night for a whole month now, the brown spots on my face seem less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt; My advice, if it irritates you, you should stop using it. If you still want to try it, wait for the rush to go away, then start off with 1 part Bleaching Treatment to 1 part normal moisturize lotion. If it still irritates like before, you should throw it away. If it irritates less, you can try 1 part treatment to 1.5 part lotion, anything more than this will have zero bleaching effect on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;To help heal the rush, use baby diaper rush ointment. Wash your face and apply only the ointment on your entire face, not just the problem area. Drink 2~4oz. water before you go to bed. Next morning the rush will be almost gone. This works for me, but maybe different on you. Hope it helps.</li>
            <li> This product works. Use as directed and it will fade the spots, but dont expect an overnight cure. You should begin to see results after first week then more after continued use.</li>
            <li> It really works, however be careful about putting  it on your face it could leave you with blotches. It&#x27;s better on thicker skin.</li>
            <li> I got this to try and lighten a really bad forehead scar from a chemical peel. After about 5 days it started to fade and now I can&#x27;t believe how even and smooth this has made my face! I love it!</li>
            <li> Cant tell nothing bad but nothing good. My skin soft but i dont see any changes with the color. Maybe because one tube not enough for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a few weeks now and i&#x27;ve seen small results. Seems like my underarms are getting lighter little by little. I&#x27;m somewhat satisfied w/ the results.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT BEFORE ,I STOPPED USING IT BECAUSE OF THE PRICE BUT FOUND IT ON AMAZON SO I DECIDED TO START USING IT AGIAN AS SOON HAS IT ARRIVED.</li>
            <li> It does nothing it listed to do. If I had a way of sending it back I could have unfortunately I was away and dissapointed with this product that I had high hopes for. This doesn&#x27;t even try to do what they said it does, not by all means...</li>
            <li> not sure if it works yet, but shipping was great</li>
            <li> I am a person of colour and I used this product to remove dark spots on my back which was created from acne. This crème did not remove my marks and I used out the tube.</li>
            <li> On a good note, the product arrived on time and was well packaged. On the flip side, it does not live up to it&#x27;s claims. Hey, everything doesn&#x27;t work for everyone and this certainly did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> This was not my first purchase. So I expected results, and results I got. I injured two fingers with a pair of scissors. My skin first showed big red spots on each finger. A few days later the spots had turned really, really dark. I thought my skin would eventually return to its natural color. When it didn&#x27;t I ordered the Fair and White. I applied a light coat to each spot. Within a couple of days the dark spots started to lighten. In less than a week my skin has returned to it&#x27;s normal, natural complexion. There is not even a hint of discoloration. I love this product.</li>
            <li> you have to conitnue use after 30 days to keep up the process.  I wouldn&#x27;t advise mixing this with other face creams, especially if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I love All of Fair &amp; White Products. This one seems to light my face reasonable fast. I use it along with the AHA soap! Started seeing results in about 3 or 4 days.Worth the price! I purchase here or the Fair &amp; White Site!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;College Student College Part-time job seekers I wanted to share this opportunity!

            <li> Waooo I have panda eyes and didn&#x27;t know how to get rid of it, after expend a lot of money in brand name products shown on tv a friend told me about this product and I very thankful that he recommend me this wonderful product this really work!!! My face looks great and younger!!!</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone. No results!!! Nothing. I would not reorder or even accept if given to me.</li>
            <li> I received this product super fast. Liked the price and the conditions in which I received it were good. Have not tried the product itself yet.</li>
            <li> I am a caramel complected African American female!  I had an issue with my neck being so many shades darker than my face!  I had struggled with it for years... but this product has lightened it about 50%... I&#x27;m very happy with the results</li>
            <li> Wow! I&#x27;m only on my second or third week of using this stuff and I&#x27;ve seen such a huge difference. I&#x27;ve had IPL for sun damage and and super bad melasma from lupus scars, acne, and everything else. The IPL treatments had made my dark spots even darker and I tried everything possible. I had prescription hydroquinone, Ambi, Triluma, and a number of lighteners. I was so desperate to get rid of these super dark areas on my face and nothing worked at all! This Fair &amp; White stuff is absolutely incredible. I use it on my spots and they&#x27;ve peeled off and my skin looks so even and my normal tone. I could not be happier! I&#x27;ve been looking for a good six years now! I&#x27;m putting on a ton of sunscreen and wearing hats out at all times though. I&#x27;m sure the spots will come back if I get any sun. I will be a customer for life! This stuff is the very best.</li>
            <li> My only critique is a GEL formulation would be less irritating to acne prone skin like mine. Although it helped bleached some scars of mine SLIGHTLY, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again b/c it made me break out.</li>
            <li> Items arrived s described and on time. Very satisfied. i wanted ti try it and it works. Just ran out after about a year. Great brand name and product.</li>
            <li> First - I thought I was ordering Fair &amp; White Gel Creme Strong Bleaching Treatment.  The picture Amazon advertised of the tube WAS NOT WHAT I RECEIVED...Instead of Intense bleaching treatment, I received a tube of Cream Gel Brighten Treatment...I believe I received a fake product of Fair &amp; White... The produce I received reads Cream Gel Brightening Treatment...Official Fair and White products spell Cream as Creme....This is not a Fair &amp; White product...I am returning this product for false advertisement...There should be a law against this...it could be something in this stuff that will destroy your face...  DO NOT BUT ANY FAIR AND WHITE PRODUCTS FROM AMAZON...BUY FROM FAIR AND WHITE DIRECT...</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;I am a Brown Skin African American and for YEARS i suffered from dark bikin scars all over my \\&quot;area\\&quot; due to shaving!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;VE recently decided to take back my lady part and seek pure PERFECTION. ive searched and searched and VOILA!&lt;br /&gt;This stuff WORKS in SO SO SO happy! i NEVER wear bathing suits because of my horrid bikini line but in about 3 to 5 weeks i will be completly ready!&lt;br /&gt;You MUST be patient! If you need to see results take photos! My dark spots are almost completly faded my hoo hah is becoming a beautiful complexion there are just a few little dark marks that still need time to fade! But wow! Its been less than TWO WEEKS!&lt;br /&gt;I will update later!</li>
            <li> It is a really good product if you are trying to get lighter or remove a scar. You just have to be consistent !</li>
            <li> Great and immediate results.  Exellent product for discoloring skins.  Totally satified with this soap and highly recommend it. A must purchase!</li>
            <li> I purchased ths item to use on my elbows and knees, yes I&#x27;ve notice a big difference after just two weeks of using it. Only down side to ths item is that it seems strong so I use another moisturizer with this cream.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product a month ago and I have to say it&#x27;s the best facial cream I&#x27;ve ever used! Cleared my black spots and left my face looking clear and bright.</li>
            <li> Great stuff really works if you have discoloration or acne scares</li>
            <li> it did not work..makes my face darker and I did not go in the sun. I work from home and have someone that does my shopping ect.. I am brown skinned, not dark, and now my face is 4 shade darker then my body, and its not a good dark, it looks burnt.. will not recomm</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and loved it, I saw a difference within 2 days and so I decided to re-order it a second time. But to my surprise my second order was so different from my first order. The color, the consistency and the strength was different. The cream was so running and I saw no difference in my skin it did nothing but made my skin greasy. I&#x27;m so disappointed and will not be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> This is the 4th day of using this product. I apply it once a day. My skin faded into a degree I can see up to 25% fading power in 4 days!!!..I mean almost 25% lighter grade of color of my skin in 4 days. I experienced some itching on my skin and little burn feeling after some time of applying. It goes out after sometime for me. It is better (out of experience) not to scrub the skin with scrubber during the time of using this product as it make the burning feeling more. The product does not have a strong smell (barely notice).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is my review after 4 days only!</li>
            <li> Its good but it did not peel as much as i would have wanted. I will purchase again.live</li>
            <li> well, it moisturizes good, but then my face feels oily and greasy after a few hours. And as far as lightening I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> Great stuff for fading brown spots and scars. I have found this product to be relatively cheaper than the beauty supply stores visited.</li>
            <li> The first bleaching creme I&#x27;ve ever used that actually works! It&#x27;s evening or my skin tone and getting rid of the dark spots. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I have this product since last year, but I only use it for flea&#x27; bite scars on my feet, it does peeling and clear out a bit, but the dry skin peeling is seriously disgusting looking. I would like to ask how do you guys use it on your face? Do you use sunscreen along with this product? then before or after you apply this cream on? please answer, thanks so much</li>
            <li> One week i applied this cream and couldn&#x27;t find any noticable difference. One day i had to go out in sun with this cream applied on my face and hands, and  now i am 4 shades darker....</li>
            <li> just what my wife wanted.  Got the order fast and it was exactly as it was ordered. I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe using the Fair &amp; White Gel Creme would take care of two very small red spots on my right cheek that are kind of like old scars.  I rubbed it into the spots and when I woke up I had two larger than quarter size bright red circles on my face where I had put the creme.  It&#x27;s been about 4 days and the circles are still red and prominent.  I&#x27;ve tried to put everything on them hoping they would heal.  It looks as if the top layer of skin was destroyed kind of like a chemical peel.  My only hope is that this is not permanent.  If they don&#x27;t go away soon I will have to give in and see a dermatologist.  My skin is very fair and sensitive and generally if I react badly to something, it goes away in a couple of days.  I was probably terribly allergic to something in the creme but I did want to warn anyone with pale, sensitive skin that if they are thinking of resolving a problem spot they should probably look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Ok so when I ordered this I ordered it for 2 reasons I have 2 dark spots that nothing has been able to remove and a bad pregnancy mask mark on my upper lip and cheek, all these are on the left side of my face and I am just down right tired of people laughing saying my left side looks 10 years older then my right. I&#x27;m fair skinned part irish/norwegian . My pregnancy mask was sooooo horrible make up didn&#x27;t cover it and every time I have walked into nail salons I always get told I need my lip waxed I got tired of fighting with one woman one day and told her fine wax it, after she did she saw the mark was there, she then told me my face very dirty so she goes and gets a towel with facial cleanser on it and tried to wash it off by the time she was done, and couldn&#x27;t remove my mark she gave me the waxing free since I didn&#x27;t need it, but this gives you an idea how bad and embarrassing my mark was. I have used this like directed for only 3 days twice a day on the 2 dark spots and pregnancy mask mark. It has already taken the pregnancy mask mark down DRASTICALLY it went from covering my lip and part of my cheek to the size of my finger tip, and that much is almost so light I couldn&#x27;t put the cream on it today cause I couldn&#x27;t see it without my glasses. I am very glad I tried this product even if the dark spots don&#x27;t go at least now I can walk into a nail salon without someone yelling you need a wax in front of the whole place. I know it may not work the same on everyone cause all skin is different but if your tired of a flaw like pregnancy mask try this I will write another review in a couple weeks about the dark spots I know they are different and will take more time to go but here&#x27;s hoping :) If this review helps even one person with a problem pregnancy mask I will be thrilled :) good luck</li>
            <li> I only used this for two days and it dryed the life out of my skin still recovering from it 4 weeks later</li>
            <li> This product contains \\&quot;Hydroquinone-1.9&amp;\\&quot; which is strongly advised by doctors to avoid when deciding on a skin bleaching cream. Hydroquinone is extremely dangerous and may lead to the development of cancer. It has already been banned in several countries. Dermatologist have recommended that we use products which include the safer lightening agent: \\&quot;Alpha Arbutin\\&quot; instead of \\&quot;Hydroquinone\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been said that \\&quot;Hydroquinone\\&quot; contains: mutagenic, clastogenic, and immunotoxic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s simply not worth the health risks just to have a lighter skin tone.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying I&#x27;ve only been using this cream for THREE days an my ance marks (black spots) on my face are completely gone !!! I have suffered from really bad ance since I was 12 an nothing has ever worked besides Fair an White. I&#x27;ve read some negative reviews saying this cream burns the face an leaves it dry , I haven&#x27;t experienced any of that other than a little dryness but what do you expect the cream is ONLY $9 your not going to get anything better for this cheap that actually works ,\\&quot; cheapos\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have melasma from hypothyroid and more than likely hormonal issues.  I tried this gel and slathered it on one night and went to bed. Firstly, it made my skin red like sunburn, which is what chemical peels do.  Then my skin peeled, like a chemical peel. Which is what I pretty much wanted.  I want my skin to slough and peel, so the new skin and hopefully non-melasma skin will be underneath.  Now because it is so strong, I am only using it one to two times a week. If you use this you need to use a good moisterizer with high SPF and try to avoid the sun. Using these products and having the area in the sun exacerbates darkening, not lightening. For melasma I have read to use hydroquinone, Retin A, kojic acid and azelaic acid.  I am using hydroquinone, kojic acid (listed in this product) and Retin A. For those who do not like or agree with using these products, then don&#x27;t use them. The National Library of Medicine states these are ingredients used to lighten melasma and that is good enough for me. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001839/)</li>
            <li> Great product work well</li>
            <li> My wife uses this mixed with a similar product to maintain her beautiful skin. She loves it so that makes me happy. She&#x27;s in her fifth decade but looks fifteen years younger.  Great price, too.</li>
            <li> Seemed lighter in certain spots if it fades better later on I will repurchase as it doesn&#x27;t burn skin or feel that bad while using.</li>
            <li> I thought that this bleacher was going to be and absolute on pore on target skin whitening kit and it&#x27;s kinda oily and not an target whitening gel I have 3 different shades of skin brown Carmel and very dark brown and I used to be  light skinned I feel completely out of myself when I&#x27;m like this  I liked it better felt better one even skin tone and that&#x27;s light skinned I conventionally didn&#x27;t attend dermatology schools or religious school&#x27;s so I don&#x27;t know and trying to see and find out what happened to my skin so the whitening bleachers did not work it wasn&#x27;t strong enough on targeted area were my skin done got dark.👽💎🔮💆💧💀🔮🎂</li>
            <li> I rate this one star because it did not work even a little bit. I bought it to lighten my scars which are not very dark to begin with and wanted to bring the scars closer to my skin color. Did not work. Used it for 5 months. What a hassle because it is so greasy as well.</li>
            <li> I had a noticeable dark spot above my lip from either waxing it or a dermatologist told me being on birth control can cause it as well. Anyways, when I was at the dermatologist I got talked into doing laser on it. It was very, very painful. If anyone has ever had it, you know it leaves scabs all over the area. It&#x27;s also pretty expensive, it cost $100 for one treatment. Anyways, it worked for a while and then came back even worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I tried this cream along with the Concha Nacar de pPerlop Natural Bleach Cream and it&#x27;s all gone! It took about two to three weeks with using both religiously. The Concha stuff at night for an hour and the Paris Bleach Cream twice a day. With the two products it cost me about $20 with shipping. Much cheaper, easier and less painful!</li>
            <li> could not tell after a month if it really worked.  I really could not tell much of a difference.  I do not wear cover stick anymore so I guess it did work somewhat.</li>
            <li> Have been using for two months, with very little improvement to hyper pigmentation.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any results</li>
            <li> Omg. This stuff really works my belly was darker than any other part of my body and  since a just had my baby and have stretch marks..i bought two tubes and iam bearly on the first one and woow worth every penny my tummy looks almost even but its awsome..</li>
            <li> this cream work very well  I have acne  over the past 20 years and  left me a lot of scars on my face I have span  so much money going to do cosmetic and nothing works until  I  start using this cream  what a big difference my husband love it.  thanks  to fairs and whitebleaching cream</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! I used it first for my spots, abd under eye darkness by using a q-tip to apply dots and rub them in. then when they dissapeared I started to lighten my entire face to even my tone, and it totally worked within a week, but in a month I was a shade lighter and almost completely even. As I kept using it I was able to keep up with occurring blemishes and have them under control too. This stuff is great. It works with hot water. And it works even better on a clean face, something about this stuff is very strong so start of slow with a small amount and work ur way up in the amount u apply. U can even add a dot to ur cleaning regiment as u scrub and clean with hot water, and u will see immediate results make sure u keep up with cleaning your face because peeling happens and u must gently exfoliate to smooth the process. Totally worth it just dont let it get in ur eyes when applying around for dark circles use q-tip to massage ointment in then u can even let a bit sit ontop of the massaged area. Results are pretty and awesome, it even takes the skin and retighten it where an over production has occur . I&#x27;m completely using this stuff for the rest of my life.. Or at least for months at a time:) u can even use this on the body with hot water and a loofa!!! Real results will occur. Even on the hands and nuckles use with scrub and hot water, a little goes a long way. Hopes this helps:)))</li>
            <li> When I think of a Gel Crème, I think differently then what the product was.  It is greasy and not recommended for oily skin!</li>
            <li> I have been using paris fair for almost 3 weeks now, twice a day morning and night and I use a spf 50 sunscreen too. The cream smell ok and goes on good too. Well I have not seen any change,(I&#x27;M BUMMED I WAS HOPING THIS WOULD DO THE TRICK) I will finish the tube and see if it make a difference.</li>
            <li> I will never buy this item again. It did absolutely nothing for my skin except burn it and make me peel. On top of that the seller doesn&#x27;t list all of the ingredients in the bleach cream. In my opinion it was a waste of 8 dollars. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> This Product severely Burn me.my Life will never be the same.please I&#x27;m warning you not to buy this product. Buying this cream was the biggest mistake of my life!!!</li>
