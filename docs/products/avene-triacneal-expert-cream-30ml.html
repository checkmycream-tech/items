            <li>No redness or flaking which is good.</li>

            <li>this treatment cream is amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m writing this, hoping that someone will try the products and find them work amazingly for them, as the products have worked for me.</li>
            <li>Avene is the best product line that I have found for sensitive and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>Using this together with a good toner helped significantly reduce the acne and redness.</li>

            <li>I like the price of the product on Amazon and will probably order again if available.</li>
            <li>Amazing product and super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I just hope someone successfully get back their skin.</li>

            <li>Product shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Used this previously and it is great but 5 stars would mean perfect.  </li>
            <li>A minor price to pay for good results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>smooth soft removes fine lines and acne</li>
            <li>The cleansing is very gentle but thoroughly cleanses my face; it helps with acnes because it&#x27;s non-irritating.</li>
            <li>received product very quickly this is a new retinol product that I tried with the acne fighting ingredients in it has worked very well</li>
            <li>My skins just funny that way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product (and its former incarnation, DiAcneal) for years and attribute the many compliments I get on my youthful appearance to its effects.  </li>
            <li>Have not yet found any similar product that deserves a better rating</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>It really helps with the scars!</li>
            <li>Strong enough to diminish cystic acne.  </li>
            <li>Great for acne prone and sensitive skin, more than half the price of what I was spending for it at my dermatologist and on other sites!  </li>
            <li>This product is gentle on skin yet strong enough to fight acne.  </li>
            <li>It was wrapped in a little box with my name hand written on it, which was nice, considering everything else I buy from Amazon comes from their warehouse-</li>
            <li>Been using this product for 2 years and it really keeps my acne in check.</li>
            <li>Really gentle as well.</li>
            <li>Works very well  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this product and works very well.</li>
            <li>I then wait around 15&#x27;-30&#x27; minutes before putting on the AC Cream, which is lightweight,  noncomedogenic, and very hydrating.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to this as long as its available.</li>
            <li>Also remember to use sunscreen with high spf in the morning as the TriAcneal makes your skin so sun-sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend for preventative acne treatment.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for anyone.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had new acnes since I started this routine.</li>
            <li>I waited a long time for this product to arrive but, it was worth the wait.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my skin clear, glowing and the retinol in it</li>
            <li>I get occasional breakouts and this product really works.</li>
            <li>FAR inferior to</li>
            <li>I use several Avene products and found they are very stable and work a described</li>
            <li>I purchased all the products myself and everything written here is of complete honesty.</li>
            <li>This is by far one of my holy grail beauty productions.  </li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t my all time favorite but that doesn&#x27;t mean that it won&#x27;t work for someone else.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s potent, so those with sensitive skin might want to use a light hand if they try it, but I&#x27;ve never had a bad reaction.  </li>
            <li>Nothing ever really helped on the long term but this cream + CeraVe</li>
            <li>Therefore, I make my face wet with the Thermal Spring water first.</li>
            <li>works especially well overnight but be ready to get some of your pillow cases stained (the product is yellow and even though it sinks fast into the skin it will stain your white pillows.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t my all time favorite but that doesn&#x27;t mean that it won&#x27;t work for someone else. My skins just funny that way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product (and its former incarnation, DiAcneal) for years and attribute the many compliments I get on my youthful appearance to its effects.  It combines glycolic acid and retinol, both of which stimulate turn over of skin cells and expose newer, younger looking skin.  It&#x27;s potent, so those with sensitive skin might want to use a light hand if they try it, but I&#x27;ve never had a bad reaction.  If your skin tolerates AHAs, BHAs, etc, this is a great choice in a treatment product for aging skin.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed to this product, I did a lot researches before I ordered it, most of the people recommend it as a MUST HAVE product, but I had using this product almost every sing day, but I didn&#x27;t see any changing on my skin,</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I was struggling with a sudden onset of adult acne, it was terrible. After using skin is quite soft, after 2 months the acne scarring was visibly gone and much less breakouts. I also recommend diacneal, the facial wash from this company.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for 2 years and it really keeps my acne in check. Not to mention my skin looks great! Use in the evening before bed and wake up with refreshed look. Must have for acne prone skin!!</li>
            <li> Used this previously and it is great but 5 stars would mean perfect.  Have not yet found any similar product that deserves a better rating but maybe there is one out there somewhere.</li>
            <li> Looove this product!!! Nothing ever really helped on the long term but this cream + CeraVe hydrating  face wash are what work the best for me!!! Love it!!</li>
            <li> I get occasional breakouts and this product really works. I use a thin coat every night before my night cream. 2mos into the routine I&#x27;m seeing less and less acne breakouts. Really gentle as well. Does tingle a bit but shows its working.</li>
            <li> The lightening of scars is visible in a couple of weeks itself.&lt;br /&gt;A slight drying of skin should be expected.</li>
            <li> Works great at keeping acne breakouts away but isn&#x27;t over drying. Same product you can purchase at your dermatologist but for half the price. Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> FAR inferior to it&#x27;s predecessor, Diacneal.  Literally does nothing for my skin.  I won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> Great product!! Arrives even before the delivery date!</li>
            <li> Pricey, but wonderful. Use with obagi blender bleaching cream.  They were recommended by my dermatologist.  What a difference they make!</li>
            <li> I do not why but my wife can not live without it. She used Diacneal before, but this Triacneal seems to do a better job.</li>
            <li> Works very well  I use several Avene products and found they are very stable and work a described</li>
            <li> I have dry skin with hormonal acne. I already use Avène Skin Recovery Cream as my everyday moisturizer, but I was looking for something that would provide anti-aging benefits, but not break me out. This fits the bill perfectly! I use it every other day, switching between this and my Mario Badescu Anti- Acne Serum. It doesn&#x27;t dry me out or break me out. I only gave it four stars because if I apply it to completely dry skin, it creates little balls of product, so I apply it on damp skin and it smooths on perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It shipped in the appropriate amount of time, coming from Greece. It was wrapped in a little box with my name hand written on it, which was nice, considering everything else I buy from Amazon comes from their warehouse- it made it feel like it was picked just for me. I am happy with the seller and won&#x27;t hesitate to buy from them again!</li>
            <li> I have medium to severe acne. I tried many, many products and methods with no visible results. Using this together with a good toner helped significantly reduce the acne and redness. works especially well overnight but be ready to get some of your pillow cases stained (the product is yellow and even though it sinks fast into the skin it will stain your white pillows. consider putting a towel  over your pillow.). A minor price to pay for good results.&lt;br /&gt;I was also very glad I could order it via Amazon since you cannot find it anywhere in stores in US because it is a prescription-strength cream.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and as described. Wife likes the product. I would repeat business</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product and works very well. I use it regularly. I like the price of the product on Amazon and will probably order again if available. Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> this treatment cream is amazing. it&#x27;s successful erased my terrible acne scars and helped with acnes. I&#x27;ve applied it every night for three months and the results are magical. I also use Avene Thermal Spring Spray, Avene Clean-AC Cleansing Cream, and Avene AC Cream together with this TriAcneal. The cleansing is very gentle but thoroughly cleanses my face; it helps with acnes because it&#x27;s non-irritating. I haven&#x27;t had new acnes since I started this routine. After I wash my face at night, I mist it with Avene Thermal Water, wait 30 seconds, then apply TriAcneal. If I apply TriAcneal to my dry skin, the treatment cream soon balls up and peels off (maybe my skin is so dehydrated). Therefore, I make my face wet with the Thermal Spring water first. I realize doing this helps the TriAcneal absorb much better too. I then wait around 15&#x27;-30&#x27; minutes before putting on the AC Cream, which is lightweight,  noncomedogenic, and very hydrating.  I used to have flawless skin and then things messed up. I&#x27;m grateful to Avene (and my dermatologist who recommended the TriAcneal). I&#x27;ve gradually found my skin back as well as my self-esteem. I&#x27;m writing this, hoping that someone will try the products and find them work amazingly for them, as the products have worked for me. I&#x27;ve tried Lancome Visionnaire, Lancome Genifique, Shiseido, Dior, SK-II, Sunday Riley, Amore Pacific Time Response serum, etc. All those products were awesome, just that they were not specialized in (permanently) erase (my) acne scars. Also remember to use sunscreen with high spf in the morning as the TriAcneal makes your skin so sun-sensitive.  Here is my current routine:  Morning:  Avene AC Cleansing Cream  SK-II Facial Treatment Essence  Shiseido White Lucent Spf 18  Shiseido Face and Body Sunscreen Lotion Spf 50  Night:  (Clarins One-step cleanser to remove the sunscreen)  Avene AC Cleansing Cream  Clarins Extra Comfort Toning Lotion  Avene Thermal Spring  Avene TriAcneal  Avene AC Cream  I bought Avene TriAcnealon Amazon, the other three items on DermStore.com (if you add the products to your favorite list, you get 10% off).  I purchased all the products myself and everything written here is of complete honesty. I just hope someone successfully get back their skin.</li>
            <li> Non irritating acne treatment.  I waited a long time for this product to arrive but, it was worth the wait.  This product is gentle on skin yet strong enough to fight acne.  Strong enough to diminish cystic acne.  I love avene better than skinceuticals because of its gentle yet effective treatment of acne.  I use it everyday, even during the day along with sun screen. No irritation.  It&#x27;s been about a month and I love it</li>
            <li> received product very quickly this is a new retinol product that I tried with the acne fighting ingredients in it has worked very well and I&#x27;m very happy with this product leaves skin smooth soft removes fine lines and acne</li>
            <li> Avene is the best product line that I have found for sensitive and acne prone skin. This is by far one of my holy grail beauty productions.  I use it at night with my acne care system, it has prevented break outs. I don&#x27;t know if its suppose to brighten skin, but I have noticed that it has cleared up some dark spots on my cheeks. I highly recommend for preventative acne treatment. I will continue to this as long as its available.</li>
            <li> It is a good cream its clear all my dark spots</li>
            <li> Great for acne prone and sensitive skin, more than half the price of what I was spending for it at my dermatologist and on other sites!  Keeps my skin clear, glowing and the retinol in it isn&#x27;t irritating yet still helps with anti aging!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Avene Tiacneal for years for occasional spot breakouts.  My dermatologist recommended this product and for good reason - it works.  Use caution when applying as it will dry out the area that it is applied to.  A little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price!! Will definitely rebuy from this seller.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Product shipped quickly. Have been using it for about 2 weeks, not a huge difference yet but I am patient. No redness or flaking which is good.</li>
            <li> Avene makes wonderful skincare products and the Triacneal cream is among the top best. I personally love the fact that it has proven results with reducing acne flare-ups and also help smooth fine lines all without over drying the skin. I highly recommend for anyone.</li>
            <li> It really helps with the scars!</li>
            <li> Amazing product and super fast shipping! Saved money and was very happy with the seller and the overnight results from this product!</li>
            <li> Wife loves this stuff</li>
