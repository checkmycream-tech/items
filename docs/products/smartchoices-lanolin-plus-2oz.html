            <li>This product is great, very easy to apply and works well for protecting nipples.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>Absorbs nicely but has a bit of a stank to it compared to the lanolin I was given in the hospital.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Much better than chapstick.</li>
            <li>It works better than anything you find in the stores.</li>
            <li>I also love that you just leave it on and baby can nurse with it on there,</li>
            <li>It is non-toxic and easily washed off with soap and water.</li>
            <li>It wipes off easy.</li>

            <li>The 100% pure lanolin (you can find it at CVS for $4) is the BEST if you have really bad cracked nipples, but this kind is wonderful because it&#x27;s not sticky and smelly.  </li>
            <li>By far the best, highly recommend for breast feeding moms.</li>
            <li>The company is also fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I could have raw, sensative nipples before bed then wake up with perfect nipples again.</li>
            <li>I love that I don&#x27;t have to use very much</li>

            <li>i tried over four different lanolins and this stuff truly is amazing its better than the ice pack</li>
            <li>Friendly and quick to respond.</li>
            <li>It is sticky though, but the stickiness goes away fast:)</li>
            <li>I read many reviews on many different products.</li>
            <li>the intense relief kits everything!!</li>
            <li>Well worth the price, lasts forever.</li>
            <li>I would say better than most other nipple creams/moisturizers.</li>
            <li>first pregnancy I used medela</li>
            <li>I have tried many different kinds.  </li>
            <li>lanolin,\\&quot;Smart Choices Lanolin Plus\\&quot; has coconut oil in it, which makes it real creamy and</li>
            <li>I have a 6mo old and am still on my first tube!</li>
            <li>So much easier to apply than 100% lanolin b/c</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pumping, and it really helps to soothe irritated nipples.</li>
            <li>coconut oil is very healing as well.</li>
            <li>So I was excited to try an &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; product, but mine is far, far from unscented.  </li>
            <li>the smart choice lanolin has fixed it all!</li>
            <li>Oh well, back to using the pure lanolin from NOW I guess.</li>
            <li>The natural lanolin restores and heals irritated skin.</li>
            <li>When I used the lanolin that the hospital gave me, I would still get days where I was just tender and sensitive and it hurt to pump.</li>
            <li>Since using this, I haven&#x27;t had a tender and sensitive day.</li>
            <li>Lanolin is a natural oil found in sheeps wool.</li>
            <li>God put it there to protect them from the wind and rain and to keep their skin soft.</li>
            <li>I bought several but ended up using this one the most for everyday use.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not as thick and has a better spreading consistency.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too thick like some other lanolin products and does a good job</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too bad, cause lanolin is the best dry skin product I&#x27;ve ever found by FAR.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the NOW pure lanolin for extremely dry skin on my hands and feet for awhile now</li>
            <li>I really like this product and ordered several tubes after my initial purchase.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s that I&#x27;ve toughened up, but I really think that it&#x27;s due to using this product.</li>
            <li>I used it from the very start of breastfeeding and have NEVER had an issue with cracked nipples, sores, or much pain in the least.</li>

            <li> It actually smells WORSE than pure lanolin!  </li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I tried a few different brands</li>
            <li> I use it multiple times a day everyday for my breast pump.  </li>
            <li> This is a must buy and very little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The item came with seal half opened.</li>
            <li> It is very thin, not thick and sticky like plain ol&#x27; lanolin.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money on the lanolin sold in stores</li>
            <li> (the 100% pure doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as people say it does though.  </li>
            <li> A lot of reviewers here seem to love this product, so needless to say I was really disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I also use it as a skin barrier when I have a small cut.</li>
            <li> I have no idea if the odor is because of the lanolin going bad due to the broken seal</li>
            <li> I think the tube I got is really old or something -- it smells terrible, like rancid vegetable oil</li>
            <li> But I HATE the smell of lanolin.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to EVERY woman who nurses (I tried the &amp;#34;M&amp;#34; brand of lanolin while in the hospital and YUCK--the smell is NASTY).</li>

            <li> I think the tube I got is really old or something -- it smells terrible, like rancid vegetable oil if you know what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the NOW pure lanolin for extremely dry skin on my hands and feet for awhile now and I love it.  But I HATE the smell of lanolin.  It&#x27;s too bad, cause lanolin is the best dry skin product I&#x27;ve ever found by FAR.  So I was excited to try an &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; product, but mine is far, far from unscented.  It actually smells WORSE than pure lanolin!  So maybe I got a fluke, I don&#x27;t know.  A lot of reviewers here seem to love this product, so needless to say I was really disappointed.  Oh well, back to using the pure lanolin from NOW I guess.</li>
            <li> This product contains no medicines. The natural lanolin restores and heals irritated skin. It is non-toxic and easily washed off with soap and water. Amazon.com has the lowest price for this quality product.</li>
            <li> This is the best lanolin product I&#x27;ve used!&lt;br /&gt;My first pregnancy I used medela and it didn&#x27;t work and my second I was using lanisol and still had pain and cracking but the smart choice lanolin has fixed it all! By far the best, highly recommend for breast feeding moms.</li>
            <li> OMG! if there is one thing you should buy when having a baby, it&#x27;s this stuff. It&#x27;s amazing. Will keep you from having cracked nipples and baby doesn&#x27;t even notice it. And it works instantly. I could have raw, sensative nipples before bed then wake up with perfect nipples again. This is a must buy and very little goes a long way. I have a 6mo old and am still on my first tube! Awesome stuff.</li>
            <li> Absorbs nicely but has a bit of a stank to it compared to the lanolin I was given in the hospital.</li>
            <li> So much easier to apply than 100% lanolin b/c it&#x27;s not as thick and has a better spreading consistency. I&#x27;m pumping, and it really helps to soothe irritated nipples. When I used the lanolin that the hospital gave me, I would still get days where I was just tender and sensitive and it hurt to pump. Since using this, I haven&#x27;t had a tender and sensitive day. Maybe it&#x27;s that I&#x27;ve toughened up, but I really think that it&#x27;s due to using this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best lanolin out there. Well worth the price, lasts forever. Truly cures your nips over night. Don&#x27;t waste money on the lanolin sold in stores</li>
            <li> The item came with seal half opened. The packaging is just a padded envelope so the tube came in pressed. It might be the reason why the seal is open from pressure. I smelled the lanolin and it has some strong odor. I have no idea if the odor is because of the lanolin going bad due to the broken seal or it&#x27;s just like that.</li>
            <li> This works like a miracle! I tried a few different brands but this one is the only thing that worked for me. I love that I don&#x27;t have to use very much so it lasts a long time. I also use it as a skin barrier when I have a small cut. It helps heal faster than neosporin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I use it multiple times a day everyday for my breast pump.  It prevents pain and chafing.  It is very thin, not thick and sticky like plain ol&#x27; lanolin.  It wipes off easy. It doesn&#x27;t stink.  I really like this product and ordered several tubes after my initial purchase.  The company is also fantastic.  Friendly and quick to respond.</li>
            <li> This lanolin is great!!  I have tried many different kinds.  The 100% pure lanolin (you can find it at CVS for $4) is the BEST if you have really bad cracked nipples, but this kind is wonderful because it&#x27;s not sticky and smelly.  (the 100% pure doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as people say it does though.  It is sticky though, but the stickiness goes away fast:) This lanolin,\\&quot;Smart Choices Lanolin Plus\\&quot; has coconut oil in it, which makes it real creamy and coconut oil is very healing as well. You will not regret buying this product!!  If you are looking for a small gift to give to a new mom who plans on breastfeeding, give her a couple tubes of this! She will love it!! Lanolin is a natural oil found in sheeps wool. God put it there to protect them from the wind and rain and to keep their skin soft. :)  I think HE had breastfeeding mom&#x27;s in mind too!!</li>
            <li> This is the best treatment for nipples while nursing/pumping.  I also tried medela&#x27;s lanolin, earth mama angel baby, and motherlove. Lanolin stained and was sticky.  This has something extra in it that makes it smoother/less sticky.  I wanted to like earth mama angel baby and mother love since they are more natural but they separated and got chunky.  This felt the best and didn&#x27;t stain my bras/shirts. I will stick with this!</li>
            <li> This product is great, very easy to apply and works well for protecting nipples.</li>
            <li> I would say better than most other nipple creams/moisturizers. I bought several but ended up using this one the most for everyday use. It&#x27;s not too thick like some other lanolin products and does a good job but it wouldn&#x27;t help when I started having cracked nipples for which the cause was not yeast infection.</li>
            <li> This works great. I read many reviews on many different products. I haven&#x27;t been sore yet and this is also great for when baby scratches her face.Id purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Best therapy there is for chapped lips. Much better than chapstick.</li>
            <li> i tried over four different lanolins and this stuff truly is amazing its better than the ice pack the intense relief kits everything!! and a huge plus is it wont stain you shirts!!!! and it last forever</li>
            <li> Great product, speedy delivery! 0 complaints. I recommend this to anyone that breastfeeds. Cures chapped, blistered nipples overnight! It works better than anything you find in the stores.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!!! I used it from the very start of breastfeeding and have NEVER had an issue with cracked nipples, sores, or much pain in the least. In fact, I now only use about once a day when I feel that they need some moisturizing and still have no issues. I also love that you just leave it on and baby can nurse with it on there, no problem. He hasn&#x27;t minded at all. I would recommend this product to EVERY woman who nurses (I tried the &amp;#34;M&amp;#34; brand of lanolin while in the hospital and YUCK--the smell is NASTY). This stuff doesn&#x27;t smell and is great, great, great.</li>
