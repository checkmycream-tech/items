            <li> As a kid I remember my grandmother always had a bottle in the laundry room and bathroom. I add a capful to my laundry to disinfect everything. This is also great foe cleaning cuts and scrapes diluted.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit of this stuff will keep gnats and &amp;#34;no see ums&amp;#34; away for hours. I guess its also a disinfectant.</li>
            <li> Always use this. Kind of like its unique scent.</li>
            <li> grew up on this product and it&#x27;s a must in my household</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells too good and it&#x27;s worth the price. I use it for my baby clothes after wash and it is really effective</li>
            <li> Love it.  Wish they sold it in the US</li>
            <li> Good for ladies during that time of the month. Good for those extra warm days and need to feel fresh. External use only and it works, try it</li>

            <li> I used this instead of green soap for my tattoo and it was so amazing. Took the pain away. No sting like green soap. And it honestly doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as green soap also. This stuff is so awesome!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for most of my life. It is a good product.&lt;br /&gt;I use it for medical and antiseptic use.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m using public laundry, I saw many people throw their showes or pets&#x27; stuff in the washer and dryer. I think I need to buy one of this for my clothes. I&#x27;m not sure how much derm it can be kill by dettol, but I feel more safty when I use this to wash my cloth in the public laundry.</li>
            <li> Great disinfectant (not &amp;#34;just&amp;#34; an antiseptic). Used in disinfecting surgical sites prior to surgery (worldwide by veterinarians, in some places by doctors).  Medicine smell, but concentration is strong and very effective. VERY good for acne too.</li>
