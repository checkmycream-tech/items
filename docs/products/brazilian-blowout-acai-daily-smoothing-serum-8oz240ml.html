            <li>This product works great for a smooth blowout.</li>
            <li>The fragrance doesn&#x27;t irritate me, which is nice because some fragrances (and all perfumes and colognes) give me a migraine.</li>

            <li>Has a nice smell as well.</li>
            <li>it really is that good!!</li>
            <li>It truly does seal the cuticle to diminish split ends and gives your hair a really nice silky shine.  </li>
            <li>It smalls nice, too.  </li>
            <li>yet when I use this product you would think I was a professional!!!!!!!!</li>

            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>My hair looks healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>I suspect results would be even BETTER if I used a flatiron as well, but most mornings before work, I just don&#x27;t have the time.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>

            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>but it works 100x better with visible results.</li>

            <li>The serum seems ok.  </li>
            <li>This is just ok.  </li>
            <li>In terms of smoothing my hair, it has done its&#x27; job, I do feel as if my hair is much more manageable throughout the day when I use this, than when I do not.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>hair looks much better when I use</li>

            <li>Nothing tames my unruly hair better.</li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Been using this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>Works great and much cheaper than buying in a salon</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I had the BB keratin treatment a year ago and all the products continue to help my hair stay smooth!  </li>
            <li>Love the condition of my hair since using this.</li>
            <li>Order through Amazon cause the price is so much better than salon.</li>
            <li>I love experimenting with my hair</li>
            <li>I love Brazilian Blowout products.</li>
            <li>But be sure to wash your hair out with freshwater and reapply if you can.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>Also smells pretty good</li>
            <li>Awesome for my dry curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I had tried this product after having the brazilian blowout done on my hair and this has worked great in keeping the frizz in my hair under control and makes the hair very soft.</li>
            <li>It smells fabulous and works even better.  </li>
            <li>It really is that good.</li>
            <li>Started using this right after getting the Brazilian Blowout and my hair looks so amazing that I have not not used it yet.</li>
            <li>Got my first blowout and love, love, love it.  </li>
            <li>This product works wonderful for  both straight and curly natural hair.</li>
            <li>If I used more than a pea sized amount my hair would feel greasy and gross, but I use a pea sized amount every morning and it has been great.</li>
            <li>I have long super curly hair and all I need is a quarter size amount to straighten my hair and it comes out perfect!</li>
            <li>I have fine, curly, color-treated hair.</li>
            <li>Even the fine hairs that float are smoothed.</li>
            <li>have color treated, fine hair (but a lot of it)...</li>
            <li>Dries out my fine hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is now pretty much static free!</li>
            <li>Vendor ships very fast!!</li>
            <li>The product smells great and goes on smoothly, even my hands aren&#x27;t greasy after I&#x27;ve used it because my hair absorbs it instantly.</li>
            <li>I notice a HUGE difference when I skip using this product.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend this product to keep your hair smooth through out the day.</li>
            <li>This product goes on light, and moisturizes my hair.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t smooth my hair at all...</li>
            <li>This is fabulous stuff it makes my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li>and this makes my  hair hang so smoothly....</li>
            <li>This product smells great, but it really doesn&#x27;t add much shine.  </li>
            <li>The best part is that my hair does not feel like there is product: neither goopy (like a mouse or gell) nor sticky or stiff (like hairspray).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>DEFINITELY WORTH IT!</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this product after I got a Brazilian Blowout hair straightener 3 years ago under my stylist&#x27;s recommendation.</li>
            <li>Originally purchased this product from a salon for $40.  </li>
            <li>I have long hair and it gives moisture, smells great and helps detangle.</li>
            <li>Despite pretty decent reviews, it did not do a thing for my hair except make it smell good.</li>
            <li>that is the most amazing deep conditioner!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t appear to do anything special but flatten my hair temporarily.</li>
            <li>I would guess this would be great for course hair or if your hair was very dry or damaged.</li>
            <li>Great product and got it before expected</li>
            <li>It smells like the real thing, but the texture was more of a conditioner than a serum.</li>
            <li>I recently had a Brazilian Blowout and decided to use these products to keep my hair in good condition.  </li>
            <li>When I started using these products my hair looked better and lasted much longer.</li>
            <li>Just have to be sure not to use too much.</li>
            <li>At least for my hair it is perfect.</li>
            <li>and I love how gentle it is on my hair.</li>
            <li>No bad smell.</li>
            <li>A great hair product on the market a bit expensive but is good</li>
            <li>but luckily I found it on Amazon for $22.</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my hair so soft and smooth</li>
            <li>Keeps hair soft, healthy, smooth, and prevents split ends.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and a lot less than in a salon.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product for thick, frizzy hair!</li>
            <li>You put a small amount in your hair and it works very nice to smooth out your hair, no friss.  </li>
            <li>I have curly fine hair and gets really frizzy.</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this product at a high end salon where I paid more than 2x</li>
            <li>Straight smooth hair.</li>
            <li>I did have a keratin treatment done to calm the frizz.</li>
            <li>I follow some recommendations and after my treatment this product help my hair to  stay smooth and straight.</li>
            <li>I have heard so much about this fantastic cream</li>
            <li>It worked really well to smooth my hair, but it irritated my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it off and on for a few years and its a great product for anyone.</li>
            <li>Great for everyday use.</li>
            <li>use about a dime worth of product while my hair is still damp (towel-dried)</li>
            <li>My hair became matted and unmanageable using this knock off.&lt;br /&gt;And just to make sure, I bought a bottle from a beautician to compare, and sure enough, the beautician sold me the real deal.</li>
            <li>but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I used it every day for two weeks, and needed to wash my hair more frequently than I would have otherwise.</li>
            <li>Good price and delivered before expected.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before you swim, lightly wet your hair with freshwater, put the Smoothing Serum in, and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>so I can straighten it right when I get out....</li>
            <li>right through it.</li>
            <li>My hair feels smooth and silky to the touch, highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>O highly recommend this light weight hair smoothing serum.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell that doesn&#x27;t linger too long or overpower you.</li>
            <li>I will stick to using the Moroccan Oil Hydrating Styling Cream, which is by far a much better product and would highly recommend using it over this one.</li>
            <li>Finally frizz free shiney and silky hair!</li>
            <li>This product has consistently been the star in my arsenal.</li>
            <li>I like this product, I could tell the difference from the first time i washed and conditioned my hair without this product</li>
            <li>I know if I used more product my review would be extremely different.</li>
            <li>It helps with frizzy and keeps my hair smooth, manageable and soft.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Best used from nape of neck down while hair is wet or damp after washing and conditioning in my experience.</li>
            <li>it really does smooth your hair well and leaves it soft and makes it shine...</li>
            <li>It still takes time, but it comes out smooth, soft, and straight.  </li>
            <li>and it stays smooth, soft, and straight.  </li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my hair shine all day long</li>
            <li>works well to keep my hair soft and smooth, particularly before blow drying.</li>
            <li>My hair hasn&#x27;t looked this healthy in a long time!</li>
            <li>My hair was super soft</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on days I go to San Francisco and while nothing will ever be strong enough to handle the moisture in that air</li>
            <li>i love this product , i can not live without it , my hair salon sells this item for twice the price i paid for it.</li>
            <li>I have straight hair to begin with, but this serum helps with fly-aways and makes my hair extra smooth.  </li>
            <li>Helps my hair remain calm and silky soft.</li>
            <li>I guess the real test will be how it works once the treatment wears off.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>For my hair type it works very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really regret buying it.</li>
            <li>it straight.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and the Brazilian blowout</li>
            <li>Very runny.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really make my hair straighter</li>
            <li>; I even love the way it works when I let my hair air-dry, which I could never really do before without frizz.</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need much product to do the job</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable compared to buying it at the Solon.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much to refresh your hair in between washes.  </li>
            <li>I really like this smoothing serum.</li>
            <li>It really keeps my hair under control.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Really smooths out my hair</li>
            <li>I have naturally straight hair, but it does get frizzy sometimes, I have lots of flyaways.</li>
            <li>Must use spraingly though because too much will look greasy.</li>
            <li>I have very wavy and frizzy hair and this product didn&#x27;t help with straightening at all.  </li>
            <li>down)...brush it in...and use my straight iron...</li>
            <li>this works really well...</li>
            <li>I have very frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>The stuff I received was nothing like the stuff at the salon, which left my hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I can exercise or go outside in humid weather or even a light rain</li>
            <li>This stuff works very well.</li>
            <li>but with this serum - my hair was so silky and straight from a 15 minute blow out......</li>
            <li>I use this on my hair extensions and my real hair after a wash</li>
            <li>The Brazilian Blowout Shampoo works very well and helps prolong the Brazilian Blowout Treatment.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and this</li>
            <li>even if you use a bit too much...</li>
            <li>Make sure to get absorbed in or it leave a stiff spot of hair.  </li>
            <li>i have think naturally curly hair, the right amount controls it, too much makes it curly and greasy, though.</li>
            <li>This daily leave-in product is a huge help in achieving smooth, flat hair.</li>
            <li>Was excited to see it was available for a lower price on Amazon,  however,  after using for 2 -3 days, even though it smells very similar to the salon product, if does NOT work the same.  </li>
            <li>the hair is amazingly shiny and soft, And my  friend who does not use the other products had me get this for him</li>
            <li>The product works great at smoothing slightly wavy hair that gets dry from the pool , color treatments, and heating tools.  </li>
            <li>other products from this brand i love - this stuff</li>
            <li>and I found that other stuff works better.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, I use it with my other hair products</li>
            <li>this is a great product for after blow drying your hair but a little goes a long way-&lt;br /&gt;one</li>
            <li>It smells great, my hair is soft and smooth and even less wavy - even air dried.</li>
            <li>This has been an effective tool for the past four years.</li>
            <li>I was told to use this product since I swim in a natural hot springs pool that is high in sulfur .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than some products but not super.</li>
            <li>I love the deep conditioning masque b/c it brought my hair back to life.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m really glad that I bought this product, and I know that it will last for a very long time because it&#x27;s so rich.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for everyone</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>A bit high in price for the products.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY REOCMMEND</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>and it really works wonders for my wavy, slightly frizzy, fine</li>
            <li>I use it every day in the morning, and i like it as it really helps keeping my hair soft and shining</li>
            <li>divide my clean dry hair into sections......</li>
            <li>Also significantly brings down the amount of frizz and really softens.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle product for my &amp;#34;fine, but a lot of it&amp;#34; prone to breakage, easily weighed down and will turn wavy if it air dries hair.</li>
            <li>I have a ton of baby fine hair, average length 12 - 14 inches.  </li>
            <li>I straighten it everyday and was hoping this would help to keep it straight and frizz free throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference right away, my hair was shiny, soft, and manageable, so I decided to purchase the entire treatment.</li>
            <li>Too much will weigh my hair down and make it feel greasy, so I take about a large pea sized amount, emulsify between my palms, and work it through the ends only, coming back around the ends in front that tend to break the most.</li>
            <li>Just start off small and work more in if needed.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased this smoothing serum is not like anything else I ever tired.</li>
            <li>The smell is good and I only need a little to cover my long hair.</li>
            <li>Works so good with my thick curly hair!!</li>
            <li>This is my first Brazilian Blowout and my goal is to keep my hair smooth and flat for as long as possible.</li>
            <li>I ride a lot of motorcycle and the wind can really do a number on it but the smothing serum really keeps my long hair managable, soft and silky.</li>
            <li>so I also use a little Moroccan cream to smooth out the flyaways.  </li>
            <li>I have not ever had that before unless I had it professionally blown out.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this at the salon or direct site.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your hair really soft.</li>
            <li>I found that the Bain de Terre recovery complex works alot better and is cheaper.</li>
            <li>My hair does not feel heavy at all, but it does feel smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li>and there is no frizz, soft and non-crunchy hair, which gets me lots of compliments on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Feel like this is actually stripping my treatment and causing my hair to revert much quicker than when I used product from salon.</li>
            <li>Execellent product to reduce frizz with naturally curly hair and leaves hair soft</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair smoothy, soft and silky.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally wavy ...which means frizzy....</li>
            <li>(too much near scalp can weight hair</li>
            <li>again...if you use too much it can look greasy so start with the least amount.. I&#x27;ve tried many different hair products for frizz and straightning...</li>
            <li>I use it on natural hair, makes my curls really soft</li>
            <li>It is not to heavy or too light.  </li>
            <li>It takes care of the frizz and still leaves me hair feeling soft and looking shiney.</li>
            <li>Then when I straighten it is really soft.</li>
            <li>I have naturally frizzy hair...</li>
            <li>It makes my hair which is normally thick and very wavy - smooth as can be.  </li>
            <li>pea sized drop spread in your hands will tame all of those frizzes and leaves hair shiny and smooth</li>
            <li>But I am fascinated how easy it is to get my hair looking slick and shiny.  </li>
            <li>and it really helps with the frizz even if I don&#x27;t blowdry or flat iron my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m posting a picture where I only did half my hair straight so you can see the before and after side my side...and see how my hair is naturally crazy and this is a great product!!</li>
            <li>No other products needed!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m usually on the look out for a good serum to tame the frizz.</li>
            <li>And this is the last part of the step, first the shampoo, then the masque, then this and blow dry and</li>
            <li>I use it every day before I dry my hair and then afterward to calm my dry ends.</li>
            <li>; about half on the top of my head and half on the ends and length (my hair is about 4&amp;#34; longer than my shoulders).</li>
            <li>I really like this even when Im not blowdrying my hair and just going wet</li>
            <li>Then I blow dry with a round brush, making sure to dry from the underneath to the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic results.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, avoid applying the product on your roots after blowdrying or at least when hair is semi dry, otherwise it will leave you the sensation of dirty hair, because it can make your hair kind of sticky and greasy if apply on wet hair.</li>
            <li>and it leave my hair soft and shiny after I blow dry it.</li>
            <li>However, my mother can use it and she has barely wavy hair that has a tendency to fall flat if she looks at it sideways.</li>
            <li>I know they recommend you at least get the shampoo and condtioner, but why not invest a little more on your investment?</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally very wavy and difficult to straighten but this serum makes it soft and straight.</li>

            <li> This product works great for a smooth blowout.</li>

            <li> yet when I use this product you would think I was a professional!!!!!!!!</li>

            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> My hair looks healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> I suspect results would be even BETTER if I used a flatiron as well, but most mornings before work, I just don&#x27;t have the time.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>

            <li> The serum seems ok.  </li>
            <li> This is just ok.  </li>
            <li> In terms of smoothing my hair, it has done its&#x27; job, I do feel as if my hair is much more manageable throughout the day when I use this, than when I do not.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> hair looks much better when I use</li>

            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for many years.  </li>
            <li> Works great and much cheaper than buying in a salon</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I had the BB keratin treatment a year ago and all the products continue to help my hair stay smooth!  </li>
            <li> Love the condition of my hair since using this.</li>
            <li> Order through Amazon cause the price is so much better than salon.</li>
            <li> I love experimenting with my hair</li>
            <li> I love Brazilian Blowout products.</li>
            <li> But be sure to wash your hair out with freshwater and reapply if you can.</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> Also smells pretty good</li>
            <li> Awesome for my dry curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I had tried this product after having the brazilian blowout done on my hair and this has worked great in keeping the frizz in my hair under control and makes the hair very soft.</li>
            <li> It smells fabulous and works even better.  </li>
            <li> It really is that good.</li>
            <li> Started using this right after getting the Brazilian Blowout and my hair looks so amazing that I have not not used it yet.</li>
            <li> Got my first blowout and love, love, love it.  </li>
            <li> This product works wonderful for  both straight and curly natural hair.</li>
            <li> If I used more than a pea sized amount my hair would feel greasy and gross, but I use a pea sized amount every morning and it has been great.</li>
            <li> I have long super curly hair and all I need is a quarter size amount to straighten my hair and it comes out perfect!</li>
            <li> I have fine, curly, color-treated hair.</li>
            <li> Even the fine hairs that float are smoothed.</li>
            <li> have color treated, fine hair (but a lot of it)...</li>
            <li> Dries out my fine hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is now pretty much static free!</li>
            <li> Vendor ships very fast!!</li>
            <li> The product smells great and goes on smoothly, even my hands aren&#x27;t greasy after I&#x27;ve used it because my hair absorbs it instantly.</li>
            <li> I notice a HUGE difference when I skip using this product.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend this product to keep your hair smooth through out the day.</li>
            <li> This product goes on light, and moisturizes my hair.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t smooth my hair at all...</li>
            <li> This is fabulous stuff it makes my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li> and this makes my  hair hang so smoothly....</li>
            <li> This product smells great, but it really doesn&#x27;t add much shine.  </li>
            <li> The best part is that my hair does not feel like there is product: neither goopy (like a mouse or gell) nor sticky or stiff (like hairspray).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> DEFINITELY WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product after I got a Brazilian Blowout hair straightener 3 years ago under my stylist&#x27;s recommendation.</li>
            <li> Originally purchased this product from a salon for $40.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair and it gives moisture, smells great and helps detangle.</li>
            <li> Despite pretty decent reviews, it did not do a thing for my hair except make it smell good.</li>
            <li> that is the most amazing deep conditioner!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t appear to do anything special but flatten my hair temporarily.</li>
            <li> I would guess this would be great for course hair or if your hair was very dry or damaged.</li>
            <li> Great product and got it before expected</li>
            <li> It smells like the real thing, but the texture was more of a conditioner than a serum.</li>
            <li> I recently had a Brazilian Blowout and decided to use these products to keep my hair in good condition.  </li>
            <li> When I started using these products my hair looked better and lasted much longer.</li>
            <li> Just have to be sure not to use too much.</li>
            <li> At least for my hair it is perfect.</li>
            <li> and I love how gentle it is on my hair.</li>
            <li> No bad smell.</li>
            <li> A great hair product on the market a bit expensive but is good</li>
            <li> but luckily I found it on Amazon for $22.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my hair so soft and smooth</li>
            <li> Keeps hair soft, healthy, smooth, and prevents split ends.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and a lot less than in a salon.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product for thick, frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> You put a small amount in your hair and it works very nice to smooth out your hair, no friss.  </li>
            <li> I have curly fine hair and gets really frizzy.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this product at a high end salon where I paid more than 2x</li>
            <li> Straight smooth hair.</li>
            <li> I did have a keratin treatment done to calm the frizz.</li>
            <li> I follow some recommendations and after my treatment this product help my hair to  stay smooth and straight.</li>
            <li> I have heard so much about this fantastic cream</li>
            <li> It worked really well to smooth my hair, but it irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it off and on for a few years and its a great product for anyone.</li>
            <li> Great for everyday use.</li>
            <li> use about a dime worth of product while my hair is still damp (towel-dried)</li>
            <li> My hair became matted and unmanageable using this knock off.&lt;br /&gt;And just to make sure, I bought a bottle from a beautician to compare, and sure enough, the beautician sold me the real deal.</li>
            <li> but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I used it every day for two weeks, and needed to wash my hair more frequently than I would have otherwise.</li>
            <li> Good price and delivered before expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before you swim, lightly wet your hair with freshwater, put the Smoothing Serum in, and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> so I can straighten it right when I get out....</li>
            <li> right through it.</li>
            <li> My hair feels smooth and silky to the touch, highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> O highly recommend this light weight hair smoothing serum.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell that doesn&#x27;t linger too long or overpower you.</li>
            <li> I will stick to using the Moroccan Oil Hydrating Styling Cream, which is by far a much better product and would highly recommend using it over this one.</li>
            <li> Finally frizz free shiney and silky hair!</li>
            <li> This product has consistently been the star in my arsenal.</li>
            <li> I like this product, I could tell the difference from the first time i washed and conditioned my hair without this product</li>
            <li> I know if I used more product my review would be extremely different.</li>
            <li> It helps with frizzy and keeps my hair smooth, manageable and soft.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Best used from nape of neck down while hair is wet or damp after washing and conditioning in my experience.</li>
            <li> it really does smooth your hair well and leaves it soft and makes it shine...</li>
            <li> It still takes time, but it comes out smooth, soft, and straight.  </li>
            <li> and it stays smooth, soft, and straight.  </li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my hair shine all day long</li>
            <li> works well to keep my hair soft and smooth, particularly before blow drying.</li>
            <li> My hair hasn&#x27;t looked this healthy in a long time!</li>
            <li> My hair was super soft</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on days I go to San Francisco and while nothing will ever be strong enough to handle the moisture in that air</li>
            <li> i love this product , i can not live without it , my hair salon sells this item for twice the price i paid for it.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair to begin with, but this serum helps with fly-aways and makes my hair extra smooth.  </li>
            <li> Helps my hair remain calm and silky soft.</li>
            <li> I guess the real test will be how it works once the treatment wears off.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> For my hair type it works very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really regret buying it.</li>
            <li> it straight.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and the Brazilian blowout</li>
            <li> Very runny.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really make my hair straighter</li>
            <li> ; I even love the way it works when I let my hair air-dry, which I could never really do before without frizz.</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t need much product to do the job</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable compared to buying it at the Solon.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much to refresh your hair in between washes.  </li>
            <li> I really like this smoothing serum.</li>
            <li> It really keeps my hair under control.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Really smooths out my hair</li>
            <li> I have naturally straight hair, but it does get frizzy sometimes, I have lots of flyaways.</li>
            <li> Must use spraingly though because too much will look greasy.</li>
            <li> I have very wavy and frizzy hair and this product didn&#x27;t help with straightening at all.  </li>
            <li> down)...brush it in...and use my straight iron...</li>
            <li> this works really well...</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> The stuff I received was nothing like the stuff at the salon, which left my hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I can exercise or go outside in humid weather or even a light rain</li>
            <li> This stuff works very well.</li>
            <li> but with this serum - my hair was so silky and straight from a 15 minute blow out......</li>
            <li> I use this on my hair extensions and my real hair after a wash</li>
            <li> The Brazilian Blowout Shampoo works very well and helps prolong the Brazilian Blowout Treatment.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and this</li>
            <li> even if you use a bit too much...</li>
            <li> Make sure to get absorbed in or it leave a stiff spot of hair.  </li>
            <li> i have think naturally curly hair, the right amount controls it, too much makes it curly and greasy, though.</li>
            <li> This daily leave-in product is a huge help in achieving smooth, flat hair.</li>
            <li> Was excited to see it was available for a lower price on Amazon,  however,  after using for 2 -3 days, even though it smells very similar to the salon product, if does NOT work the same.  </li>
            <li> the hair is amazingly shiny and soft, And my  friend who does not use the other products had me get this for him</li>
            <li> The product works great at smoothing slightly wavy hair that gets dry from the pool , color treatments, and heating tools.  </li>
            <li> other products from this brand i love - this stuff</li>
            <li> and I found that other stuff works better.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, I use it with my other hair products</li>
            <li> this is a great product for after blow drying your hair but a little goes a long way-&lt;br /&gt;one</li>
            <li> It smells great, my hair is soft and smooth and even less wavy - even air dried.</li>
            <li> This has been an effective tool for the past four years.</li>
            <li> I was told to use this product since I swim in a natural hot springs pool that is high in sulfur .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than some products but not super.</li>
            <li> I love the deep conditioning masque b/c it brought my hair back to life.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m really glad that I bought this product, and I know that it will last for a very long time because it&#x27;s so rich.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for everyone</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> A bit high in price for the products.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY REOCMMEND</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> and it really works wonders for my wavy, slightly frizzy, fine</li>
            <li> I use it every day in the morning, and i like it as it really helps keeping my hair soft and shining</li>
            <li> divide my clean dry hair into sections......</li>
            <li> Also significantly brings down the amount of frizz and really softens.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle product for my &amp;#34;fine, but a lot of it&amp;#34; prone to breakage, easily weighed down and will turn wavy if it air dries hair.</li>
            <li> I have a ton of baby fine hair, average length 12 - 14 inches.  </li>
            <li> I straighten it everyday and was hoping this would help to keep it straight and frizz free throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference right away, my hair was shiny, soft, and manageable, so I decided to purchase the entire treatment.</li>
            <li> Too much will weigh my hair down and make it feel greasy, so I take about a large pea sized amount, emulsify between my palms, and work it through the ends only, coming back around the ends in front that tend to break the most.</li>
            <li> Just start off small and work more in if needed.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased this smoothing serum is not like anything else I ever tired.</li>
            <li> The smell is good and I only need a little to cover my long hair.</li>
            <li> Works so good with my thick curly hair!!</li>
            <li> This is my first Brazilian Blowout and my goal is to keep my hair smooth and flat for as long as possible.</li>
            <li> I ride a lot of motorcycle and the wind can really do a number on it but the smothing serum really keeps my long hair managable, soft and silky.</li>
            <li> so I also use a little Moroccan cream to smooth out the flyaways.  </li>
            <li> I have not ever had that before unless I had it professionally blown out.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this at the salon or direct site.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your hair really soft.</li>
            <li> I found that the Bain de Terre recovery complex works alot better and is cheaper.</li>
            <li> My hair does not feel heavy at all, but it does feel smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li> and there is no frizz, soft and non-crunchy hair, which gets me lots of compliments on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Feel like this is actually stripping my treatment and causing my hair to revert much quicker than when I used product from salon.</li>
            <li> Execellent product to reduce frizz with naturally curly hair and leaves hair soft</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair smoothy, soft and silky.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy ...which means frizzy....</li>
            <li> (too much near scalp can weight hair</li>
            <li> again...if you use too much it can look greasy so start with the least amount.. I&#x27;ve tried many different hair products for frizz and straightning...</li>
            <li> I use it on natural hair, makes my curls really soft</li>
            <li> It is not to heavy or too light.  </li>
            <li> It takes care of the frizz and still leaves me hair feeling soft and looking shiney.</li>
            <li> Then when I straighten it is really soft.</li>
            <li> I have naturally frizzy hair...</li>
            <li> It makes my hair which is normally thick and very wavy - smooth as can be.  </li>
            <li> pea sized drop spread in your hands will tame all of those frizzes and leaves hair shiny and smooth</li>
            <li> But I am fascinated how easy it is to get my hair looking slick and shiny.  </li>
            <li> and it really helps with the frizz even if I don&#x27;t blowdry or flat iron my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m posting a picture where I only did half my hair straight so you can see the before and after side my side...and see how my hair is naturally crazy and this is a great product!!</li>
            <li> No other products needed!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m usually on the look out for a good serum to tame the frizz.</li>
            <li> And this is the last part of the step, first the shampoo, then the masque, then this and blow dry and</li>
            <li> I use it every day before I dry my hair and then afterward to calm my dry ends.</li>
            <li> ; about half on the top of my head and half on the ends and length (my hair is about 4&amp;#34; longer than my shoulders).</li>
            <li> I really like this even when Im not blowdrying my hair and just going wet</li>
            <li> Then I blow dry with a round brush, making sure to dry from the underneath to the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic results.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing, avoid applying the product on your roots after blowdrying or at least when hair is semi dry, otherwise it will leave you the sensation of dirty hair, because it can make your hair kind of sticky and greasy if apply on wet hair.</li>
            <li> and it leave my hair soft and shiny after I blow dry it.</li>
            <li> However, my mother can use it and she has barely wavy hair that has a tendency to fall flat if she looks at it sideways.</li>
            <li> I know they recommend you at least get the shampoo and condtioner, but why not invest a little more on your investment?</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally very wavy and difficult to straighten but this serum makes it soft and straight.</li>
            <li> And definitely seems to protect my hair from the flat iron.  </li>
            <li> It last a long time since you only use a tiny bit after each shampoo.</li>
            <li> that means that in the last 3 yrs I have permed, straighten,dyed, blow dried, and styled my hair with hot rollers or other hot styling products; nonetheless, my scalp was flaky  due to dryness, my hair was super dry,unmanageable, fizzy, and just difficult to style.</li>
            <li> Last long enough.</li>
            <li> If you pay all that money to get the Brazilian Blowout you HAVE to buy the products or it doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> Blowing drying and flat ironing</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t bother flat ironing until days</li>
            <li> This product seems to help with all the torture I put my hair through (flat iron, hairdryer).  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, though my hair is wild by nature</li>
            <li> and then when I do decide to flat iron you are protected!</li>
            <li> My hair is natural wave with tons if wave and lots if tight curl underneath.</li>
            <li> I use this plus the thermal straightening balm, dry and the style my hair with either a flat iron or curling iron.</li>
            <li> They seem to work well, but this can weigh your hair down a little if you use too much.</li>
            <li> I was having a crazy amount of static in my hair each day, and was hoping this would solve the problem.</li>
            <li> so It lasts for long time.</li>
            <li> Will continue to use this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> Well long after the straightening wore out I still use this, and this alone.  </li>
            <li> and I find I can go between washings twice as long because I don&#x27;t have to use hairspray.</li>
            <li> The blowout has long since warn off</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time in the ocean in the Caribbean recently and this works!</li>
            <li> Made my very frizzy thick hair manageable</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to blow dry as long.</li>
            <li> Although I am extremely happy with the Brazilian Blowout shampoo and conditioner, this product left me very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other things and keep going back to this.</li>
            <li> It is a bit pricey but one tube has lasted me over a year with daily to every other day use.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of very thick hair and a very oily scalp so any &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; product makes my hair feel greasy and gross.</li>
            <li> If I put this on and let it air dry, it tames the waves, but probably just as well as a cheaper drugstore product might do.</li>
            <li> , it was a lot frizzier and dry.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re color treated or dry, this is a must have for after the shower</li>
            <li> Would not want to blow dry my hair without it</li>
            <li> After washing and conditioning, I use this and then twirl 1/8 portions of my hair before diffusing it dry.  </li>
            <li> and I use a dime sized amount every day and then blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I use this every time i wash and blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> Would not buy again because it seems to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> This did not live up to expectations.  </li>
            <li> and before I flew back to the States I washed, blow dried, and flat-ironed my hair in about 20 minutes - the same time I would&#x27;ve spent if I hadn&#x27;t gone swimming.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair feel like butter when I blow dry it!  </li>
            <li> I have curly hair that is just curly enough to look terrible on its own!</li>
            <li> I mix it with a few other products, like Aveda gel and African oil and then blow dry or flat iron.</li>
            <li> I live in Minnesota and have coarse, very thick, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> You use very little but it works very well to tame frizz and lessen the look of overworked and over processed hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> All you need is tiny little nickel size dap for all your hair.</li>
            <li> Total cost was a little over $100 dollars.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few days now and my hair is finally feeling and looking the way it should.&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> It can become frizzy and rough when it air dries and sometimes even after blow drying if the weather is damp.</li>
            <li> you just spent a lot of money already.  </li>
            <li> damaged by 299.00 treatment, not real thing...</li>
            <li> The serum used at the salon was pink and creamy.</li>
            <li> Discovered it when I got a Brazilian blowout a few years back.</li>
            <li> The product is expensive but it lasts quite a long time because you do not need to use much.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It has been impossible up until my daughter suggested this product to fine something that worked with my hair.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> a little goes a very long way</li>
            <li> I have blow dried my hair once since having this product and I only had to use the product on my towel dried hair...</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t tame any flyaways and just felt heavy and gross.</li>
            <li> Hair will get very heavy and flat.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel like silk and completely detangles (and I have very thick, curly hair).  </li>
            <li> Long story short - my hair was fried and the ends so badly damaged that I had to cut several inches off of my hair in order to look human once again.  </li>
            <li> Totally not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Consistency is different,  and it made my hair thick, and sticky,  everything I&#x27;m trying to get away from by using the Brazillian Blowout treatments.  </li>
            <li> It left my hair thick and crispy</li>
            <li> Leaves bair greasy oily and weighed down, does make hair smoot but not worth it.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair (black n white).</li>
            <li> /frizz without weighing my hair down or making it feel &amp;#34;product-y.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> The product isn&#x27;t greasy and does not weigh hair down.  </li>
            <li> but I continue to use this product as I found it adds a slight shine and fights frizz without weighing down my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bottles are small however a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The finer your hair is the less you should have to use.</li>
            <li> Maybe because I can even leave it slightly damp and it won&#x27;t get fr when it dries, even after I am done with the hair drier.</li>
            <li> She just uses notably less than I do.</li>
            <li> I note the pictured bottle is pink, not sure why.</li>
            <li> I have really thick and long hair that can be frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it is a little pricey</li>
            <li> My hair is still a little frizzy</li>
            <li> but I think it helps a little.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping for something to feel a little silkier on my hair.  </li>
            <li> A little bit does wonders.</li>
            <li> you can rectify it with a little bit of hair volumizer (powder formulation).</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel like I just had the Brazilian blowout down again!</li>
            <li> Made my hair fall like crazy at the shower I have a third of hair I had in only 2 weeks, i so regret buying this</li>
            <li> No matter how much I used, my hair always looked dirty and greasy.</li>
            <li> Even if you have a lot of hair, curly, straight, whatever, DO NOT go crazy on this.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> So I use this product sparingly or it will create a slightly heavy feel.  </li>
            <li> Made my hair feel limp.  </li>
            <li> Does not make your hair heavy, greasy or sticky.  </li>
            <li> The blowout is not cheap, so might as well take care of it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> Way too heavy for my hair.  </li>
            <li> smoothing w/out being too heavy</li>
            <li> the directions say to apply a dime size amount to towel dried hair...</li>
            <li> Been using for a few years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this line for a few years now</li>
            <li> and I still use this product and it helps tame my hair even though the blow out is wearing off.</li>
            <li> however small amount you use, makes hair heavy and greasy and does NOT detangle or defrizz</li>
            <li> Getting it from a random seller on Amazon is no different than wiping your @ss with the money and flushing it down the toilet.&lt;br /&gt;Shame on you for selling garbage!</li>
            <li> (I have baby fine hair that curls and frizzes very badly).</li>
            <li> I usually can put a lot of product in my hair including oils, but this just didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> I usually have to use another product also to get some shine and silkiness.</li>
            <li> Also, I use a small amount on non-wash days for the flyaways and that&#x27;s all I need.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s the product or my problem hair.</li>
            <li> It also helps to tame my hair as the keratin treatment slowly wears off.</li>
            <li> I have waist length, thick, wavy highlighted hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, course, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> hair is fairly thick and I have it colored about every 3-4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY thick &amp;#34;split personality&amp;#34; hair:  </li>
            <li> Sadly, it weighed my hair down and made it look dull and unwashed.  </li>
            <li> Seriously keeps the frizz away if there is any moisture in the air.</li>
            <li> I am so not good at blowing out my hair..</li>
            <li> Salt is not good for blowouts, that includes sweat.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick and curly/frizzy shoulder length hair and use this all the time.  </li>
            <li> It has been difficult to find products that hold your hair without feeling like you have sprayed lacquer on your hair.  </li>
            <li> Having said that, I know when I have been sold a fake product and this is DEFINITELY a FAKE product!</li>
            <li> My hair felt dirty after using it as as directed.</li>
            <li> Very expensive and lets face it</li>
            <li> Some inexpensive and some very expensive.</li>
            <li> It is ok,my hair is still frizzy,just not as bad</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the packaging as well.</li>
            <li> I hated this product.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Calms the wildest mane.</li>
            <li> I have fine, curly, color-treated hair. It has been impossible up until my daughter suggested this product to fine something that worked with my hair. I love this product. It enhances the curls, smooths the fizz. My hair looks healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well as described, overall I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> Made my hair fall like crazy at the shower I have a third of hair I had in only 2 weeks, i so regret buying this I used another shampoo and conditioner and it stopped then I showered again with this to see if it was the cause and there again all the falling lots of hair it clogged the bathtub</li>
            <li> This is my first Brazilian Blowout and my goal is to keep my hair smooth and flat for as long as possible. This daily leave-in product is a huge help in achieving smooth, flat hair. Even the fine hairs that float are smoothed. The best part is that my hair does not feel like there is product: neither goopy (like a mouse or gell) nor sticky or stiff (like hairspray).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use about a dime worth of product while my hair is still damp (towel-dried); about half on the top of my head and half on the ends and length (my hair is about 4&amp;#34; longer than my shoulders). Then I blow dry with a round brush, making sure to dry from the underneath to the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic results. I suspect results would be even BETTER if I used a flatiron as well, but most mornings before work, I just don&#x27;t have the time.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years.  It smells fabulous and works even better.  No frizz.  Straight smooth hair.</li>
            <li> other products from this brand i love - this stuff however small amount you use, makes hair heavy and greasy and does NOT detangle or defrizz&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Great product! Love it. Finally frizz free shiney and silky hair! I have not ever had that before unless I had it professionally blown out.</li>
            <li> I find these products make a difference in preserving your blowout  If you are going to spend money on the blowout preserve the investment.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t even need to get the Brazilian blowout, you just need to by serum!!  My hair is naturally very wavy and difficult to straighten but this serum makes it soft and straight.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Helps my hair remain calm and silky soft. Love it.</li>
            <li> I hated this product. No matter how much I used, my hair always looked dirty and greasy. It didn&#x27;t tame any flyaways and just felt heavy and gross. I usually can put a lot of product in my hair including oils, but this just didn&#x27;t do anything. Not a fan.</li>
            <li> Started using this right after getting the Brazilian Blowout and my hair looks so amazing that I have not not used it yet. I am 6 weeks into the treatment and have also been low pooing. I guess the real test will be how it works once the treatment wears off. The smell is good and I only need a little to cover my long hair.</li>
            <li> Awesome for my dry curly hair.  It was introduced by my hair specialist.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.  I bought the mask and the leave-in conditioning serum.</li>
            <li> I have been getting the Brazilian Blowout for almost 6 years now. I always get the after care products so i know what they feel like, smell like and how my hair behaves when using them. Having said that, I know when I have been sold a fake product and this is DEFINITELY a FAKE product! It smells like the real thing, but the texture was more of a conditioner than a serum. My hair became matted and unmanageable using this knock off.&lt;br /&gt;And just to make sure, I bought a bottle from a beautician to compare, and sure enough, the beautician sold me the real deal. I have been using it for a few days now and my hair is finally feeling and looking the way it should.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and find a salon with the product. Getting it from a random seller on Amazon is no different than wiping your @ss with the money and flushing it down the toilet.&lt;br /&gt;Shame on you for selling garbage!</li>
            <li> It really works. I have waist length, thick, wavy highlighted hair. It can become frizzy and rough when it air dries and sometimes even after blow drying if the weather is damp. This product has consistently been the star in my arsenal. It smells great, my hair is soft and smooth and even less wavy - even air dried. I&#x27;ve tried other things and keep going back to this. I&#x27;m ordering more today.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair feel like butter when I blow dry it!  For all of the claims noted on the package - this item lives up to each point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have color treated, fine hair (but a lot of it)... So I use this product sparingly or it will create a slightly heavy feel.  I like to layer this will another spray for extra body.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Used it a couple of times before I realized this was causing my scalp to break out.</li>
            <li> Excellent product - speedy delivery</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. My stylist used it on my hair after I got it colored. My hair was super soft so I had to buy some for at home. I use this plus the thermal straightening balm, dry and the style my hair with either a flat iron or curling iron. No frizz or fly aways. This is A++++.</li>
            <li> Dries out my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I tried this product as an alternative to Oribe&#x27;s Supershine Moisturizing Cream because I was in a budget crunch.  Sadly, it weighed my hair down and made it look dull and unwashed.  Not too happy with the product so I returned it.  Needless to say, I restructured my budget and went back to Oribe Supershine Moisturizing Cream :)</li>
            <li> I have straight hair to begin with, but this serum helps with fly-aways and makes my hair extra smooth.  Great smell too!</li>
            <li> Love it for my fly always and frizz</li>
            <li> Love....use with every shampoo</li>
            <li> Works great. Vendor ships very fast!!</li>
            <li> I had tried this product after having the brazilian blowout done on my hair and this has worked great in keeping the frizz in my hair under control and makes the hair very soft. Love this product!</li>
            <li> I recently had a Brazilian Blowout and decided to use these products to keep my hair in good condition.  I love the way my hair feels after using this serum.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have curly fine hair and gets really frizzy. This product works wonderful for  both straight and curly natural hair.</li>
            <li> It smells great! I recommend the 10 min blow out treatment though. It&#x27;s 5x more expensive but it works 100x better with visible results. This only products, doesn&#x27;t add quality or anything. I&#x27;ve gone though 3 bottles and I found that other stuff works better.</li>
            <li> Great product and Great price.... Paid way more in the salon.  Will purchase again.  Smells great and works great...keep selling it.</li>
            <li> I am a regular user of this brazilian blowout serum.  For my hair type it works very well.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It makes my hair which is normally thick and very wavy - smooth as can be.  It smells great too and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that is just curly enough to look terrible on its own! This product smooths my hair and helps the curls form better than they do on their own. SO HAPPY to have discovered this product!</li>
            <li> This is a great product! Yes, it is a little pricey but it is worth it. I had a brazilian blow out a while ago (more than two month ago) and I still use this product and it helps tame my hair even though the blow out is wearing off.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for thick, frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> Love the stuff.  Helps combat the frizzies.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> Would recommend this product to keep your hair smooth through out the day. I highly recommend this product for everyone</li>
            <li> I live in Minnesota and have coarse, very thick, wavy hair. I straighten it everyday and was hoping this would help to keep it straight and frizz free throughout the day. Despite pretty decent reviews, it did not do a thing for my hair except make it smell good. Totally not worth the money. I really regret buying it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for my hair.  My hair feels smooth and silky to the touch, highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle product for my &amp;#34;fine, but a lot of it&amp;#34; prone to breakage, easily weighed down and will turn wavy if it air dries hair. If I put this on and let it air dry, it tames the waves, but probably just as well as a cheaper drugstore product might do. The fragrance doesn&#x27;t irritate me, which is nice because some fragrances (and all perfumes and colognes) give me a migraine. Too much will weigh my hair down and make it feel greasy, so I take about a large pea sized amount, emulsify between my palms, and work it through the ends only, coming back around the ends in front that tend to break the most. I&#x27;ve used it on days I go to San Francisco and while nothing will ever be strong enough to handle the moisture in that air this definitely does help.</li>
            <li> I like this as my leave-in product after I wash my hair, it works well if I wear my hair curly or flat-iron it straight.  My hair is still a little frizzy so I also use a little Moroccan cream to smooth out the flyaways.  I have very curly hair and the Brazilian blowout doesn&#x27;t straighten it, it just loosens the curl and lessens the frizz.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, I use it with my other hair products</li>
            <li> I use all of the Brazilian Blowout products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works well to keep my hair soft and smooth, particularly before blow drying. It is not heavy and it smells wonderful.  I have really thick and long hair that can be frizzy.  This has been an effective tool for the past four years.</li>
            <li> You use very little but it works very well to tame frizz and lessen the look of overworked and over processed hair.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Love this serum, works great in the Florida weather.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!! Leaves my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for my curly hair. Takes the frizz out and it&#x27;s a better price than my salon. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Although I am extremely happy with the Brazilian Blowout shampoo and conditioner, this product left me very disappointed.  Despite the creamy texture of the serum, which I like, it does not give my hair a silky look or feel.  I will stick to using the Moroccan Oil Hydrating Styling Cream, which is by far a much better product and would highly recommend using it over this one.</li>
            <li> Yuck. Leaves bair greasy oily and weighed down, does make hair smoot but not worth it.</li>
            <li> I like this product, I could tell the difference from the first time i washed and conditioned my hair without this product, it was a lot frizzier and dry.</li>
            <li> I have thick, course, wavy hair.  I did have a keratin treatment done to calm the frizz. This product goes on light, and moisturizes my hair.  It also helps to tame my hair as the keratin treatment slowly wears off.</li>
            <li> A great hair product on the market a bit expensive but is good</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel limp.  I had used this at the salon but it was not the same product that I got.  Very runny.  Put a wax coating on my hair.</li>
            <li> This product works great for a smooth blowout.</li>
            <li> Great for what it is intended for.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it!  Works as described. No bad smell. Last long enough. I will by it again. Nice product.</li>
            <li> I use this product after each wash.  I have coarse hair and it really helps with the frizz even if I don&#x27;t blowdry or flat iron my hair.</li>
            <li> excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;love how it feels in my hair.</li>
            <li> This serum is the best. Definitely makes straightening my hair easier and not as frizzy. My hair is natural wave with tons if wave and lots if tight curl underneath.</li>
            <li> the best conditioner and detangler. Don&#x27;t even need to have brazilian blow out hair. If you&#x27;re color treated or dry, this is a must have for after the shower</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really make my hair straighter but I think it helps a little.  And definitely seems to protect my hair from the flat iron.  Also smells pretty good</li>
            <li> I love all Brazilian products!!!</li>
            <li> I am so not good at blowing out my hair.. yet when I use this product you would think I was a professional!!!!!!!! DEFINITELY WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> i love this product , i can not live without it , my hair salon sells this item for twice the price i paid for it. I am on my second tube will keep on buying from this merchant</li>
            <li> When I wash my hair. This is a must in it. My hair stylist loves it to. She ended up getting some for her clients.</li>
            <li> It is a good product when I do not have time for blowout my hair. I can get my hair under control with this product. It is a big size so It lasts for long time.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product after I got a Brazilian Blowout hair straightener 3 years ago under my stylist&#x27;s recommendation. Now I use it because I Iove it and it really works wonders for my wavy, slightly frizzy, fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It softens and relaxes my curl/frizz without weighing my hair down or making it feel &amp;#34;product-y.&amp;#34; I even love the way it works when I let my hair air-dry, which I could never really do before without frizz. You really don&#x27;t need much product to do the job so it seems to last forever.</li>
            <li> Love it, I d order it again.  The price is reasonable compared to buying it at the Solon.  My hair is now softer</li>
            <li> a little goes a very long way</li>
            <li> Got my first blowout and love, love, love it.  You don&#x27;t need much to refresh your hair in between washes.  Also great before you go into water, workout or sweating.  Salt is not good for blowouts, that includes sweat.  Does not make your hair heavy, greasy or sticky.  Just start off small and work more in if needed.  Don&#x27;t buy this at the salon or direct site.  Very expensive and lets face it you just spent a lot of money already.  Some some money and buy from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I really like this smoothing serum. I have wavy hair and it tends to frizz in humidity. This product is GREAT in the humidity. It really keeps my hair under control.</li>
            <li> You put a small amount in your hair and it works very nice to smooth out your hair, no friss.  I was at the salon and they tried to sell me this product for $40 but luckily I found it on Amazon for $22.</li>
            <li> Awesome deal thank you</li>
            <li> This product works great .</li>
            <li> Love this product! Hair feels so moisturized after I use it. Very satisfied! Will continue to use this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this product on my hair - loved it, so I bought my own tube!!!</li>
            <li> The serum seems ok.  I was hoping for something to feel a little silkier on my hair.  I usually have to use another product also to get some shine and silkiness.</li>
            <li> All you need is tiny little nickel size dap for all your hair. Leaves your hair really soft. I know they recommend you at least get the shampoo and condtioner, but why not invest a little more on your investment? The blowout is not cheap, so might as well take care of it.</li>
            <li> This is just ok.  I found that the Bain de Terre recovery complex works alot better and is cheaper.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Item was as described</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed. It didn&#x27;t appear to do anything special but flatten my hair temporarily. I gave it a fair chance. My hair felt dirty after using it as as directed. I used it every day for two weeks, and needed to wash my hair more frequently than I would have otherwise. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> It has been difficult to find products that hold your hair without feeling like you have sprayed lacquer on your hair.  This product gives my hair body, and sheen and holds fairly well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous products and this one finally tames my hair without feeling like I have a lot of product in my hair.  A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Love it! Really smooths out my hair and I don&#x27;t have to blow dry as long.</li>
            <li> I use it every day in the morning, and i like it as it really helps keeping my hair soft and shining</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t smooth my hair at all...Didn&#x27;t do nothing</li>
            <li> this is a great product for after blow drying your hair but a little goes a long way-&lt;br /&gt;one pea sized drop spread in your hands will tame all of those frizzes and leaves hair shiny and smooth</li>
            <li> This is fabulous stuff it makes my hair smooth and shiny. Would not want to blow dry my hair without it</li>
            <li> Way too heavy for my hair.  I have a ton of baby fine hair, average length 12 - 14 inches.  Even the smallest amount is like Vaseline in my hair.  I would guess this would be great for course hair or if your hair was very dry or damaged.</li>
            <li> Within one week of getting my Brazilian Blowout done I was invited to a waterpark. I ordered this and used it before going and it worked!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have naturally straight hair, but it does get frizzy sometimes, I have lots of flyaways. In terms of smoothing my hair, it has done its&#x27; job, I do feel as if my hair is much more manageable throughout the day when I use this, than when I do not. This is a SERUM so you literally only need a PEA sized amount. I have a lot of very thick hair and a very oily scalp so any &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; product makes my hair feel greasy and gross. If I used more than a pea sized amount my hair would feel greasy and gross, but I use a pea sized amount every morning and it has been great. My hair does not feel heavy at all, but it does feel smooth and manageable. Even if you have a lot of hair, curly, straight, whatever, DO NOT go crazy on this. Start with a pea sized amount and go up if you feel as if you can. I know if I used more product my review would be extremely different. The product smells great and goes on smoothly, even my hands aren&#x27;t greasy after I&#x27;ve used it because my hair absorbs it instantly. Overall I&#x27;m really glad that I bought this product, and I know that it will last for a very long time because it&#x27;s so rich.</li>
            <li> I have always needed a multitude of products for my frizzy/curly hair.  I had a Brazilian blowout a couple of years ago and the stylist recommended this product.  Well long after the straightening wore out I still use this, and this alone.  After washing and conditioning, I use this and then twirl 1/8 portions of my hair before diffusing it dry.  That&#x27;s all I need to do and there is no frizz, soft and non-crunchy hair, which gets me lots of compliments on my hair.  Also, I use a small amount on non-wash days for the flyaways and that&#x27;s all I need.  I will cry if this gets taken off the market, I am so reliant on it.</li>
            <li> I was directed to this product years ago when I took advantage of a coupon deal to get a Brazilian blowout.  Long story short - my hair was fried and the ends so badly damaged that I had to cut several inches off of my hair in order to look human once again.  I have never done another brazilian since that time but I continue to use this product as I found it adds a slight shine and fights frizz without weighing down my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fairly thick and I have it colored about every 3-4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put a quarter sized dollop on my hands after towel drying my hair, run a comb through and then style.  I notice a HUGE difference when I skip using this product.  Love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff! Seriously keeps the frizz away if there is any moisture in the air.</li>
            <li> smoothing w/out being too heavy</li>
            <li> damaged by 299.00 treatment, not real thing...my hair was like hay after using this product</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my hair shine all day long</li>
            <li> Great product! Speedy delivery!</li>
            <li> This is a great complement to the shampoo and conditioner. I love it. It has made my Brazilian Blow last longer if I use it regularly.</li>
            <li> I follow some recommendations and after my treatment this product help my hair to  stay smooth and straight. Good price.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem as good as the one purchased in the salon.</li>
            <li> If you pay all that money to get the Brazilian Blowout you HAVE to buy the products or it doesn&#x27;t last as long. When I started using these products my hair looked better and lasted much longer.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel like silk and completely detangles (and I have very thick, curly hair).  Also significantly brings down the amount of frizz and really softens.  Has a nice smell as well.</li>
            <li> I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks much better when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;Very good controlling frizz.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful. Must use spraingly though because too much will look greasy.</li>
            <li> This product smells great, but it really doesn&#x27;t add much shine.  I have a brazillian blow out treatment, just done in November.  My hair tends to look the same with or without this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this even when Im not blowdrying my hair and just going wet, it is a great detangler and then when I do decide to flat iron you are protected! much better price tan in a salon!</li>
            <li> amazing for curly hair !</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Makes hair smooth and give it a nice bounce</li>
            <li> I have had several brazilian blowouts now and I use these products. They seem to work well, but this can weigh your hair down a little if you use too much. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It is ok,my hair is still frizzy,just not as bad</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so silky and with no frizz!</li>
            <li> Originally purchased this product from a salon for $40.  Was excited to see it was available for a lower price on Amazon,  however,  after using for 2 -3 days, even though it smells very similar to the salon product, if does NOT work the same.  Consistency is different,  and it made my hair thick, and sticky,  everything I&#x27;m trying to get away from by using the Brazillian Blowout treatments.  Feel like this is actually stripping my treatment and causing my hair to revert much quicker than when I used product from salon.</li>
            <li> This serum is addictive! Nothing tames my unruly hair better.</li>
            <li> Execellent product to reduce frizz with naturally curly hair and leaves hair soft</li>
            <li> I have very wavy and frizzy hair and this product didn&#x27;t help with straightening at all.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> Yes this product helped keep my hair softened and shiny . I was told to use this product since I swim in a natural hot springs pool that is high in sulfur . It has helped keep the Brazialian blowout that I got in Feb.</li>
            <li> I have heard so much about this fantastic cream but it just made my hair sticky and did not work well at all.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this product at a high end salon where I paid more than 2x the prices on Amazon. This product makes my hair smoothy, soft and silky. It lasts for months, unless my sister steals it because, it&#x27;s that good. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have hair that is a couple inches below my shoulders and I use a dime sized amount every day and then blow dry my hair. It&#x27;s shiny, healthy and beautiful!</li>
            <li> I had a brazilian blowout about a month ago.  I use all the products to help maintain the investment into the process.  It is very light.</li>
            <li> little bit goes a long way.  i have think naturally curly hair, the right amount controls it, too much makes it curly and greasy, though.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it. I have long super curly hair and all I need is a quarter size amount to straighten my hair and it comes out perfect! No other products needed!</li>
            <li> Best qulaity i have ever seen yet</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy ...which means frizzy....the directions say to apply a dime size amount to towel dried hair...what I personally do is...divide my clean dry hair into sections......apply about a quarter size amount to a section...concentrating on the ends...(too much near scalp can weight hair down)...brush it in...and use my straight iron...it really does smooth your hair well and leaves it soft and makes it shine...all day...again...if you use too much it can look greasy so start with the least amount.. I&#x27;ve tried many different hair products for frizz and straightning...this works really well...I personally don&#x27;t like blow drying my hair...I wash my hair at night...and wear a shower cap in the morning during my shower..so I can straighten it right when I get out....I have blow dried my hair once since having this product and I only had to use the product on my towel dried hair...didn&#x27;t have to put any on before straightening it...I also bought the shampoo and conditioner...but save your money...this is all you need for great results....I&#x27;m posting a picture where I only did half my hair straight so you can see the before and after side my side...and see how my hair is naturally crazy and this is a great product!!</li>
            <li> Works great. Just have to be sure not to use too much. Hair will get very heavy and flat. The finer your hair is the less you should have to use.</li>
            <li> It worked somewhat as I hoped for. Not sure if it&#x27;s the product or my problem hair.</li>
            <li> Love this serum!  Use it all the time and was having to pay over $40 from my stylist!  Will definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> I was having a crazy amount of static in my hair each day, and was hoping this would solve the problem. And it did! My hair is now pretty much static free!</li>
            <li> Have used several times.  Make sure to get absorbed in or it leave a stiff spot of hair.  Does keep very smooth</li>
            <li> It worked really well to smooth my hair, but it irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> I use this every time i wash and blow dry my hair. It really is that good. I will use this product till i&#x27;m 90!...it really is that good!!</li>
            <li> Its smoothes the hair perfectly well but somehow it does not feel on palm the same as the one I got from a salon.</li>
            <li> The most amazing product I have ever tried !! I have been exploring products for years. Some inexpensive and some very expensive. I am very pleased this smoothing serum is not like anything else I ever tired. It truly does seal the cuticle to diminish split ends and gives your hair a really nice silky shine.  My hair hasn&#x27;t looked this healthy in a long time!</li>
            <li> I use it on natural hair, makes my curls really soft</li>
            <li> I Love it!!!  Works so good with my thick curly hair!!</li>
            <li> Great product and got it before expected</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my hair so soft and smooth</li>
            <li> Best product I ever used.  I have very frizzy hair.  Since using this product, my hair does not frizz, even if its raining or humid.&lt;br /&gt;My hairdresser introduced me to this miracle serum.  I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Love how it makes my hair look and feel!</li>
            <li> Made my very frizzy thick hair manageable and I find I can go between washings twice as long because I don&#x27;t have to use hairspray.</li>
            <li> The serum used at the salon was pink and creamy. The serum I received from Amazon, in the same bronze tube was white cream. I note the pictured bottle is pink, not sure why. The stuff I received was nothing like the stuff at the salon, which left my hair silky and smooth. The stuff I received from Amazon was like hairspray in a cream. It left my hair thick and crispy</li>
            <li> I ride a lot of motorcycle and the wind can really do a number on it but the smothing serum really keeps my long hair managable, soft and silky. I can wash it, appy the serum and comb right through it.</li>
            <li> A bit high in price for the products.  Will not buy again at this price.  Disappointed in the packaging as well.</li>
            <li> This line of products is great!  The daily smoothing serum detangles and adds shine to hair!!  A little bit does wonders.</li>
            <li> This is the best smoothing cream on the market. It last a long time since you only use a tiny bit after each shampoo. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product since I started having a Brazilian blowout, and it still lives up to its performance whenever I use it.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for many years.  Leaves hair very smooth and in great condition.  Highly recommend.  Amazon has best price!</li>
            <li> Miracle product. One of my hair must-haves along with Unite 7-Seconds Conditioner (another miracle product). Best used from nape of neck down while hair is wet or damp after washing and conditioning in my experience. Keeps hair soft, healthy, smooth, and prevents split ends. Can be used with or without blowdrying. Highly recommend. Your hair will thank you.</li>
            <li> Works great and much cheaper than buying in a salon</li>
            <li> Would not buy again because it seems to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> It is not to heavy or too light.  I use it every day before I dry my hair and then afterward to calm my dry ends.</li>
            <li> Great smoothing serum. Makes my hair feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li> This did nothing for my hair.  I feel that it made it feel like straw.  Will not use again.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price good to deal with</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY thick &amp;#34;split personality&amp;#34; hair:  some areas curly, some wavy, some wiry.  Breath on it and it frizzes.  I&#x27;m not kidding.  I have tried dozens or products and this one is the VERY BEST.  It has made the process of drying my hair a pleasure.  It still takes time, but it comes out smooth, soft, and straight.  I can go 3 or 4 days without shampooing.  I can exercise or go outside in humid weather or even a light rain and it stays smooth, soft, and straight.  The product is expensive but it lasts quite a long time because you do not need to use much.  I HIGHLY REOCMMEND this product.  Please try it!!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve used it off and on for a few years and its a great product for anyone.</li>
            <li> I am sounding like a commercial for the product. But I am fascinated how easy it is to get my hair looking slick and shiny.  No frizzes and it dries faster. Maybe because I can even leave it slightly damp and it won&#x27;t get fr when it dries, even after I am done with the hair drier. At least for my hair it is perfect. (I have baby fine hair that curls and frizzes very badly).</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this on me in the shop. Of course I had to come here for it instead of paying salon price. I love it. I have long hair and it gives moisture, smells great and helps detangle.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair so I&#x27;m usually on the look out for a good serum to tame the frizz. This stuff works very well. It takes care of the frizz and still leaves me hair feeling soft and looking shiney. It smells amazing too!</li>
            <li> I have very thick and curly/frizzy shoulder length hair and use this all the time.  I had the BB keratin treatment a year ago and all the products continue to help my hair stay smooth!  Will see how Atlanta humidity does this summer w/o the treatment!</li>
            <li> Good price and delivered before expected.</li>
            <li> Excellent service. Good product.</li>
            <li> Great for everyday use. Especially during the summertime</li>
            <li> This smoothing serum is AMAZING!!!!! After shampooing and conditioning apply serum. I have thick curly hair (black n white). Blowing drying and flat ironing my hair took about 1.5 hr but with this serum - my hair was so silky and straight from a 15 minute blow out......I didn&#x27;t bother flat ironing until days later.&lt;br /&gt;I also used it as a leave in when I wear my hair curly. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!</li>
            <li> BEST PRODUCT EVER I use this on my hair extensions and my real hair after a wash and it leave my hair soft and shiny after I blow dry it. Then when I straighten it is really soft.</li>
            <li> This product seems to help with all the torture I put my hair through (flat iron, hairdryer).  It helps with frizzy and keeps my hair smooth, manageable and soft.</li>
            <li> Been using for a few years. Love the condition of my hair since using this. Order through Amazon cause the price is so much better than salon.</li>
            <li> Love the product, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I always use this product when I get a blow out. I always purchase via Amazon, the price savings is great.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over two years and my hair is so silky and frizz-free--And this is the last part of the step, first the shampoo, then the masque, then this and blow dry and the hair is amazingly shiny and soft, And my  friend who does not use the other products had me get this for him and he uses it in his hair and loves it, it smells good too...Try it!</li>
            <li> I sought  this product out after my hair salon stopped stocking it.  The product works great at smoothing slightly wavy hair that gets dry from the pool , color treatments, and heating tools.  Hair becomes shiny, manageable and flowing. The product isn&#x27;t greasy and does not weigh hair down.  It smalls nice, too.  It is a bit pricey but one tube has lasted me over a year with daily to every other day use. O highly recommend this light weight hair smoothing serum.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and a lot less than in a salon.  Ordered on Thursday, received the following Monday. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this line for a few years now and I love how gentle it is on my hair. It&#x27;s great for straightening and blowout maintenance and smells great as well!!!</li>
            <li> The Brazilian Blowout Shampoo works very well and helps prolong the Brazilian Blowout Treatment. I have used the shampoo the last couple of years and will continue using the shampoo in the future.</li>
            <li> This did not live up to expectations.  I thought it was a miracle frizz cure and it was not.  It&#x27;s better than some products but not super.</li>
            <li> I love experimenting with my hair that means that in the last 3 yrs I have permed, straighten,dyed, blow dried, and styled my hair with hot rollers or other hot styling products; nonetheless, my scalp was flaky  due to dryness, my hair was super dry,unmanageable, fizzy, and just difficult to style. About 2 months ago, my hair stylist washed my hair with Acai anti-frizz shampoo, then used Acai anti-frizz conditioned, and then Acai daily smoothing serum leave-in styling protection. I noticed a difference right away, my hair was shiny, soft, and manageable, so I decided to purchase the entire treatment. Entire treatment included the above and a deep conditioning masque. I love the deep conditioning masque b/c it brought my hair back to life. Total cost was a little over $100 dollars. The bottles are small however a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love Brazilian Blowout products. I do not get the treatment on my hair but use the products because they are awesome. I use the serum daily. I mix it with a few other products, like Aveda gel and African oil and then blow dry or flat iron. I also use the Brazilian Blowout mask.. that is the most amazing deep conditioner!</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for years. Discovered it when I got a Brazilian blowout a few years back. The blowout has long since warn off but I keep using this serum. I have very curly hair and this the best after-the-shower cream I&#x27;ve ever found. It keeps the curls shapely and tames the frizz. It has a nice smell that doesn&#x27;t linger too long or overpower you. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, though my hair is wild by nature so that isn&#x27;t surprising. However, my mother can use it and she has barely wavy hair that has a tendency to fall flat if she looks at it sideways. She just uses notably less than I do. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Brazilian Blowout recommends this product before swimming in the pool or ocean. I spent a lot of time in the ocean in the Caribbean recently and this works! I&#x27;m Black/mixed with kinky-curly hair and before I flew back to the States I washed, blow dried, and flat-ironed my hair in about 20 minutes - the same time I would&#x27;ve spent if I hadn&#x27;t gone swimming. The keratin held up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before you swim, lightly wet your hair with freshwater, put the Smoothing Serum in, and you&#x27;re good to go. But be sure to wash your hair out with freshwater and reapply if you can.</li>
            <li> Perfect with my Brazilian blowout.  I use it once a week and it makes my blowout last weeks and weeks longer.</li>
            <li> I tried this product after I had my BB, that made me look for it and purchase it. It smells amazing, avoid applying the product on your roots after blowdrying or at least when hair is semi dry, otherwise it will leave you the sensation of dirty hair, because it can make your hair kind of sticky and greasy if apply on wet hair.</li>
            <li> Love this! Makes my hair feel like I just had the Brazilian blowout down again!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Love the product.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by my stylest.  It helps make my hair easier to style and keeps the frizz to a minimum.  I definitely recommend this product - and the entire line of Brazillian Blowout products.</li>
            <li> This works like a dream for me.  I have naturally frizzy hair...and this makes my  hair hang so smoothly....even if you use a bit too much...you can rectify it with a little bit of hair volumizer (powder formulation). This is great stuff!</li>
