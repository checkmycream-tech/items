            <li>Top of the line for Wahl indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It took one day to deliver the machine works like a dream am really really satisfied You get what you pay for am so satisfied</li>
            <li>but the liners could of been better</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>And when the set came it&#x27;s such a great presentation !  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased I did.  </li>
            <li>The alternative in my mind when I was purchasing this set was a $150 oster duo set glad I went with Wahl never had one issue and</li>
            <li>Overall very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had MANY pairs of the cheaper Wahl&#x27;s, I like them, but the cut doesn&#x27;t compare to this pro set.  </li>
            <li>The detail trimmer is outstanding.</li>
            <li>The instructions could be more detailed&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>Great and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what else to say,but I love&#x27;em</li>
            <li>Appears to cut ok</li>
            <li>these have been the best clippers I&#x27;ve found especially considering the price.</li>
            <li>Initial impression is excellent.</li>
            <li>but I love that the machine does not over heat.</li>
            <li>The quality of the product is outstanding.</li>
            <li>I would be using this clippers for many years to come.</li>
            <li>but ours came with oil - no need to buy more.  </li>
            <li>The cord look thicker and better.</li>
            <li>They cut very well and do not get very warm at all.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anybody looking for a great pair of clippers.</li>
            <li>Works really well...have already saved the cost in my own haircuts!</li>
            <li>The attachments you receive with the set are perfect and the extra clippers are perfect for clean lines on the neck, my hubby personally loves for his face !!</li>
            <li>The motor is amazing and cuts hair quick.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy cheap clippers and regret it later, these are the best set of trimmers I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
            <li>The clippers are exceptional never glitchy always strong and powerful.</li>
            <li>These two are even better than I expected from the best.</li>
            <li>Wahl clippers didn&#x27;t have a smooth cute.</li>
            <li>still strong as ever and a clean shave!</li>
            <li>it seems to rust easy even with oil.</li>
            <li>Makes giving a haircut sooo easy.</li>
            <li>Yes it will get alittle warm, but not too hot to hold.</li>
            <li>This one is working fine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to keep free of hair and to oil the blades.</li>
            <li>I buffed it out and they are fine.  </li>
            <li>I will say out of the box they are fine for a close beard shave cut.</li>
            <li>If god had long hair, he&#x27;d use a Wahl to fade and trim to look good!</li>
            <li>This little thing works great!  </li>
            <li>Like everyone else i&#x27;ve tried the Walmart brand clippers and these are a huge upgrade.</li>
            <li>but like the cheap one we had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They cut well and light.</li>
            <li>clippers are made from durable plastic (though the trimmers seem alittle on the cheap side from the material that is used, but they give a grade A performance).</li>
            <li>The physical quality looked great.</li>
            <li>smooth finish &amp;</li>
            <li>Its worth the money, already paid for itself and more....</li>
            <li>Hopefully I can come back a year from now and tell you that it&#x27;s still working great.</li>
            <li>These clippers are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them for several months and have been quite happy.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>And the smaller trimmer is great for edging</li>
            <li>it wouldn&#x27;t glide smoothly over my husband&#x27;s head.  </li>
            <li>The liners aren&#x27;t sharp but the clippers are very good</li>
            <li>We have been very pleased so far!</li>
            <li>I mainly cut my own hair and don&#x27;t do anything fancy with it, so I&#x27;m pretty happy to use the main clippers and then 2-3 of the guards to get the right length all around.</li>
            <li>/&gt;professional quality heavy duty works just great better than cheap brands</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased so far with the unit.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with these clippers thus far.</li>
            <li>Keep it clean and oiled and it will cut well and run quite.</li>
            <li>I bought this set of wall clippers to clean up my hairy neck between hair cuts and to buzz my head instead of paying $10-15 every 6 weeks.</li>
            <li>i clean it after every use and it is stored in a safe/dry place.</li>
            <li>its not getting hot and its light fit for my hand</li>
            <li>Works very well &amp; very satisfied by how fast I had recieved my item.</li>
            <li>Honestly my initial hesitation had to do with the fact that I felt I was getting too good of a deal with this set for my money.</li>
            <li>this was a gift love every thing work very goog</li>
            <li>Have lasted many years so far and they are still going strong.</li>
            <li>It works great cuts sharp.</li>
            <li>Clips very fast and perfect for my small dog.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend top dollar &amp; get a high end set.  </li>
            <li>If you want to pay yourself many times over order these durable, high quality clippers.</li>
            <li>I love them and would recommend them to anyone professional or not!!</li>
            <li>After two weeks use, I&#x27;m very happy with the new set I received with the newer, improved attachment combs, as well as the new, adjustment lever on the larger clipper.</li>
            <li>No problems, they run nice and quiet and cool.</li>
            <li>Brand is the best ever, long lasting.</li>
            <li>Really does make it so easy to cut hair.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Nice smooth cut with minimal effort.</li>
            <li>worth the buy.</li>
            <li>Good product, works as expected.</li>
            <li>The clippers are powerful.</li>
            <li>better then the old Oster ones I use to use.</li>
            <li>Would be nice to have the tapered right and left combs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Received item quickly, and was exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li>but you&#x27;ll likely need to special order more attachments to get the trimming lengths you want</li>
            <li>small Trimmer is great..</li>
            <li>The trimmer also gives me that fresh and crisp line up</li>
            <li>Love this buzzer I wish the plastic pieces were a little more durable</li>
            <li>My wife really likes these clippers better than our older cheaper ones as they are much sharper and QUIETER.</li>
            <li>I chose to write a review today 4 months later because I&#x27;m as happy today with these as I was when I watched my husband open the box on christmas morning.  </li>
            <li>After a quick application of oil, I proceeded to completely cut my full head of hair.</li>
            <li>And my old Wahl clipper, which was still working just fine . . .</li>
            <li>I bought this for my adult grandson and he loves it , it seems to do a fine job on his hair.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get hot at all...</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are much higher quality than what you will find at Wal-Mart or Target.</li>
            <li>I like them because they are better than my last clippers</li>
            <li>Fantastic product, My wife used to cut my hair 3 times so far.</li>
            <li>Cuts and trims very well!</li>
            <li>This was is lasting and runs so much better.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted 9 years.  </li>
            <li>I might use the trimmers in back, if my wife is around to help make sure it&#x27;s even.</li>
            <li>Comes with lots of extras (brush for tiny hairs in the blades, oil and many guards)&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>This was the first trimmer I have ever bought.</li>
            <li>These do not get hot.</li>
            <li>Married to a Marine, so we use these every week.  </li>
            <li>Much better than the previous cheap clippers used.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is razor sharp and easily cuts all the fine hairs and details around my ears and neck.</li>
            <li>The clippers get warm but not hot after about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>I was worried that would suck, so I am happy that it&#x27;s minimal extra work at the end of the cut.</li>
            <li>I ended up leaving only part of the kit in the cheap bag they provide, with the rest in a drawer for the rare occasion I need it.</li>
            <li>Wahl has a great reputation and compared to the other clippers I&#x27;ve owned these are a definite improvement.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed when I turned it on was that it was so much quieter than all the others I have purchased.  </li>
            <li>Only used the smaller trimmer but it worked great so far.</li>
            <li>Great set the clipper is no different from any other wahl clipper except for the blade you can upgrade it by putting a taper blade on it</li>
            <li>Small clippers work really good to get close on her feet.&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s too small to hold everything good.</li>
            <li>, I have several months using it and it turned out a good buy, is quiet and economic, would recommend.</li>
            <li>The beard trimmer gets less use, but it is quite precise and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Am not impressed at all because I read all the wonderful comments that people posted about the product before I purchased it, so I had high expectations for the machine.but now</li>
            <li>Very sharp blades, neck trimmer is so nice.</li>
            <li>The clippers are smooth, cut well, and the attachments snap on and off tightly, but easily.  </li>
            <li>Also when I turn it on, the blades shake and makes a quick loud noise .</li>
            <li>Comes with a carrying case to keep everything in the same place and easy to find.  </li>
            <li>Great quality, cuts through thick hair like butter!</li>
            <li>The clippers cut right through everything I put in front of it.&lt;br /&gt;However, now I need a new one, because I dropped it and</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for nothing, BEAUTY4FAMILY.</li>
            <li>VERY</li>
            <li>Therefore, using it is a real pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So much easier than what I used to do.</li>
            <li>would HIGHLY recommend this product to all, friend or foe!</li>
            <li>Thanks again..</li>
            <li>It gets a little warm when I take too long to fine tune or something, but that&#x27;s nothing.</li>
            <li>The reason I gave it 4 stars is I haven&#x27;t been able to get the small clippers to work adequately.</li>
            <li>This set is high quality and industrial strength: contains 6 length clips, fine trimmers, regular clippers, and oil for the blades.</li>
            <li>The trimmers are good and sharp but I am not totally sold on the clippers.  </li>
            <li>The price on Amazon is much more reasonable than all the other stores.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars only because I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to report on longevity, but I would happily recommend these.  </li>
            <li>this clipper kit is decent.</li>
            <li>My hair grows more evenly as well, when it comes time for my next haircut, I dont look like such a mess : )</li>
            <li>High Noise and vibration</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The clipper is solid and significantly more powerful than my previous one (*</li>
            <li>Very sturdy professional clipper set, just like barbers use.</li>
            <li>The fine trimmers are also convenient for other areas of body hair.</li>
            <li>Its not hard.</li>
            <li>With the new trimmers, they did not leave any &amp;#34;stragglers&amp;#34;, much like a professional cut.</li>
            <li>I will update the review every couple of months regarding the sharpness of the blades and anything new we run into with these clippers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And according to They description said this item was new</li>
            <li>and they are still running, I could just add new blades.  </li>
            <li>Some either miss hair or get very loud.  </li>
            <li>Usually I try not to spend more than $30.00.  </li>
            <li>My husband is one that at a young age began to loose his hair and now just needs a quick trim and a #2 guard all around.</li>
            <li>Also after 4 haircuts back to back the unit was still cool to the touch.  </li>
            <li>They do a great job cutting my son&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>this wahl professional 8329 essentials combo...</li>
            <li>So far no issues.  </li>
            <li>This wahl trimmer cuts as close a shave as my old trimmer and will finish the job every time because of the cord.  </li>
            <li>I wish i had my old ones</li>
            <li>Professional clippers.</li>
            <li>The shaver completely died within 7 months.</li>
            <li>Seems very durable, but I&#x27;ve only used it once.</li>
            <li>the metal clippers don&#x27;t feel completely rounded/smooth around the edges.</li>
            <li>far as performance, this thing is a beast.</li>
            <li>If  you want professional clippers that can cut like razors....</li>
            <li>It should trim lower than the clippers do, which it doesn&#x27;t- and it almost has a snagging on all of my hair no matter how far I adjusted the blade in either direction.  </li>
            <li>He had to finish the cut with his old clipper.  </li>
            <li>I cannot trim my four year old with this device.</li>
            <li>Works good and hasn&#x27;t failed me yet.</li>
            <li>As in not like any other trimmers worth a dime!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a review, here, about a Mother with three kids.</li>
            <li>A very heavy to handle it but the strong.</li>
            <li>Watched a YouTube video on cutting one&#x27;s own hair and went to work!  </li>
            <li>I had to replace my old, dull clippers, and this set fit the bill to a T.</li>
            <li>-- Replacd both since the new ones came as a set at a terrific price.</li>
            <li>I started out with some cheap $20 dollar ones and have had a few mid range clippers from there</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t get hot or loud,like my other Wahl clipper did.</li>
            <li>As a reference I would say I have medium to fine hair, so others may want to opine on how well it performs on thick hair.  </li>
            <li>Have a complete line of attachments for different lengths of the haircut.</li>
            <li>The product has some updates from our last one has the newer, improved attachment combs, as well as the new, adjustment lever on the larger clipper.</li>
            <li>I was excited to have a new trimmer as I broke my previous one a few years back and never replaced it.  </li>
            <li>They are quiet, both the clipper and the trimmer are much quieter, similar to what you hear from the professional barber, very sharp and just work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and now I wish I had bought it sooner instead of using my old ones for so long.</li>
            <li>I only repeated it once to make sure there weren&#x27;t any longer hairs left behind.  </li>
            <li>It seems like this will last me a long time, though I do wonder whether the guards (which have very bendy plastic teeth) will last as long.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They went right through my hair, which is usually cut every 2 weeks even after waiting 3 weeks this time.</li>
            <li>This would cost over $100 at the stores and I usually don&#x27;t spend more than $30 at the stores, so I decided to spend a little extra money this time.   </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for other neophytes, like myself!</li>

            <li> Top of the line for Wahl indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took one day to deliver the machine works like a dream am really really satisfied You get what you pay for am so satisfied</li>
            <li> but the liners could of been better</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> And when the set came it&#x27;s such a great presentation !  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pleased I did.  </li>
            <li> The alternative in my mind when I was purchasing this set was a $150 oster duo set glad I went with Wahl never had one issue and</li>
            <li> Overall very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had MANY pairs of the cheaper Wahl&#x27;s, I like them, but the cut doesn&#x27;t compare to this pro set.  </li>
            <li> The detail trimmer is outstanding.</li>
            <li> The instructions could be more detailed&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> Great and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what else to say,but I love&#x27;em</li>
            <li> Appears to cut ok</li>
            <li> these have been the best clippers I&#x27;ve found especially considering the price.</li>
            <li> Initial impression is excellent.</li>
            <li> but I love that the machine does not over heat.</li>
            <li> The quality of the product is outstanding.</li>
            <li> I would be using this clippers for many years to come.</li>
            <li> but ours came with oil - no need to buy more.  </li>
            <li> The cord look thicker and better.</li>
            <li> They cut very well and do not get very warm at all.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anybody looking for a great pair of clippers.</li>
            <li> Works really well...have already saved the cost in my own haircuts!</li>
            <li> The attachments you receive with the set are perfect and the extra clippers are perfect for clean lines on the neck, my hubby personally loves for his face !!</li>
            <li> The motor is amazing and cuts hair quick.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy cheap clippers and regret it later, these are the best set of trimmers I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
            <li> The clippers are exceptional never glitchy always strong and powerful.</li>
            <li> These two are even better than I expected from the best.</li>
            <li> Wahl clippers didn&#x27;t have a smooth cute.</li>
            <li> still strong as ever and a clean shave!</li>
            <li> it seems to rust easy even with oil.</li>
            <li> Makes giving a haircut sooo easy.</li>
            <li> Yes it will get alittle warm, but not too hot to hold.</li>
            <li> This one is working fine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to keep free of hair and to oil the blades.</li>
            <li> I buffed it out and they are fine.  </li>
            <li> I will say out of the box they are fine for a close beard shave cut.</li>
            <li> If god had long hair, he&#x27;d use a Wahl to fade and trim to look good!</li>
            <li> This little thing works great!  </li>
            <li> Like everyone else i&#x27;ve tried the Walmart brand clippers and these are a huge upgrade.</li>
            <li> but like the cheap one we had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They cut well and light.</li>
            <li> clippers are made from durable plastic (though the trimmers seem alittle on the cheap side from the material that is used, but they give a grade A performance).</li>
            <li> The physical quality looked great.</li>
            <li> smooth finish &amp;</li>
            <li> Its worth the money, already paid for itself and more....</li>
            <li> Hopefully I can come back a year from now and tell you that it&#x27;s still working great.</li>
            <li> These clippers are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them for several months and have been quite happy.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> And the smaller trimmer is great for edging</li>
            <li> it wouldn&#x27;t glide smoothly over my husband&#x27;s head.  </li>
            <li> The liners aren&#x27;t sharp but the clippers are very good</li>
            <li> We have been very pleased so far!</li>
            <li> I mainly cut my own hair and don&#x27;t do anything fancy with it, so I&#x27;m pretty happy to use the main clippers and then 2-3 of the guards to get the right length all around.</li>
            <li> /&gt;professional quality heavy duty works just great better than cheap brands</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased so far with the unit.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with these clippers thus far.</li>
            <li> Keep it clean and oiled and it will cut well and run quite.</li>
            <li> I bought this set of wall clippers to clean up my hairy neck between hair cuts and to buzz my head instead of paying $10-15 every 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> i clean it after every use and it is stored in a safe/dry place.</li>
            <li> its not getting hot and its light fit for my hand</li>
            <li> Works very well &amp; very satisfied by how fast I had recieved my item.</li>
            <li> Honestly my initial hesitation had to do with the fact that I felt I was getting too good of a deal with this set for my money.</li>
            <li> this was a gift love every thing work very goog</li>
            <li> Have lasted many years so far and they are still going strong.</li>
            <li> It works great cuts sharp.</li>
            <li> Clips very fast and perfect for my small dog.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend top dollar &amp; get a high end set.  </li>
            <li> If you want to pay yourself many times over order these durable, high quality clippers.</li>
            <li> I love them and would recommend them to anyone professional or not!!</li>
            <li> After two weeks use, I&#x27;m very happy with the new set I received with the newer, improved attachment combs, as well as the new, adjustment lever on the larger clipper.</li>
            <li> No problems, they run nice and quiet and cool.</li>
            <li> Brand is the best ever, long lasting.</li>
            <li> Really does make it so easy to cut hair.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Nice smooth cut with minimal effort.</li>
            <li> worth the buy.</li>
            <li> Good product, works as expected.</li>
            <li> The clippers are powerful.</li>
            <li> better then the old Oster ones I use to use.</li>
            <li> Would be nice to have the tapered right and left combs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Received item quickly, and was exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li> but you&#x27;ll likely need to special order more attachments to get the trimming lengths you want</li>
            <li> small Trimmer is great..</li>
            <li> The trimmer also gives me that fresh and crisp line up</li>
            <li> Love this buzzer I wish the plastic pieces were a little more durable</li>
            <li> My wife really likes these clippers better than our older cheaper ones as they are much sharper and QUIETER.</li>
            <li> I chose to write a review today 4 months later because I&#x27;m as happy today with these as I was when I watched my husband open the box on christmas morning.  </li>
            <li> After a quick application of oil, I proceeded to completely cut my full head of hair.</li>
            <li> And my old Wahl clipper, which was still working just fine . . .</li>
            <li> I bought this for my adult grandson and he loves it , it seems to do a fine job on his hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot at all...</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are much higher quality than what you will find at Wal-Mart or Target.</li>
            <li> I like them because they are better than my last clippers</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, My wife used to cut my hair 3 times so far.</li>
            <li> Cuts and trims very well!</li>
            <li> This was is lasting and runs so much better.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted 9 years.  </li>
            <li> I might use the trimmers in back, if my wife is around to help make sure it&#x27;s even.</li>
            <li> Comes with lots of extras (brush for tiny hairs in the blades, oil and many guards)&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> This was the first trimmer I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> These do not get hot.</li>
            <li> Married to a Marine, so we use these every week.  </li>
            <li> Much better than the previous cheap clippers used.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is razor sharp and easily cuts all the fine hairs and details around my ears and neck.</li>
            <li> The clippers get warm but not hot after about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I was worried that would suck, so I am happy that it&#x27;s minimal extra work at the end of the cut.</li>
            <li> I ended up leaving only part of the kit in the cheap bag they provide, with the rest in a drawer for the rare occasion I need it.</li>
            <li> Wahl has a great reputation and compared to the other clippers I&#x27;ve owned these are a definite improvement.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when I turned it on was that it was so much quieter than all the others I have purchased.  </li>
            <li> Only used the smaller trimmer but it worked great so far.</li>
            <li> Great set the clipper is no different from any other wahl clipper except for the blade you can upgrade it by putting a taper blade on it</li>
            <li> Small clippers work really good to get close on her feet.&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s too small to hold everything good.</li>
            <li> , I have several months using it and it turned out a good buy, is quiet and economic, would recommend.</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer gets less use, but it is quite precise and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Am not impressed at all because I read all the wonderful comments that people posted about the product before I purchased it, so I had high expectations for the machine.but now</li>
            <li> Very sharp blades, neck trimmer is so nice.</li>
            <li> The clippers are smooth, cut well, and the attachments snap on and off tightly, but easily.  </li>
            <li> Also when I turn it on, the blades shake and makes a quick loud noise .</li>
            <li> Comes with a carrying case to keep everything in the same place and easy to find.  </li>
            <li> Great quality, cuts through thick hair like butter!</li>
            <li> The clippers cut right through everything I put in front of it.&lt;br /&gt;However, now I need a new one, because I dropped it and</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for nothing, BEAUTY4FAMILY.</li>
            <li> VERY</li>
            <li> Therefore, using it is a real pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So much easier than what I used to do.</li>
            <li> would HIGHLY recommend this product to all, friend or foe!</li>
            <li> Thanks again..</li>
            <li> It gets a little warm when I take too long to fine tune or something, but that&#x27;s nothing.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave it 4 stars is I haven&#x27;t been able to get the small clippers to work adequately.</li>
            <li> This set is high quality and industrial strength: contains 6 length clips, fine trimmers, regular clippers, and oil for the blades.</li>
            <li> The trimmers are good and sharp but I am not totally sold on the clippers.  </li>
            <li> The price on Amazon is much more reasonable than all the other stores.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars only because I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to report on longevity, but I would happily recommend these.  </li>
            <li> this clipper kit is decent.</li>
            <li> My hair grows more evenly as well, when it comes time for my next haircut, I dont look like such a mess : )</li>
            <li> High Noise and vibration</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The clipper is solid and significantly more powerful than my previous one (*</li>
            <li> Very sturdy professional clipper set, just like barbers use.</li>
            <li> The fine trimmers are also convenient for other areas of body hair.</li>
            <li> Its not hard.</li>
            <li> With the new trimmers, they did not leave any &amp;#34;stragglers&amp;#34;, much like a professional cut.</li>
            <li> I will update the review every couple of months regarding the sharpness of the blades and anything new we run into with these clippers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And according to They description said this item was new</li>
            <li> and they are still running, I could just add new blades.  </li>
            <li> Some either miss hair or get very loud.  </li>
            <li> Usually I try not to spend more than $30.00.  </li>
            <li> My husband is one that at a young age began to loose his hair and now just needs a quick trim and a #2 guard all around.</li>
            <li> Also after 4 haircuts back to back the unit was still cool to the touch.  </li>
            <li> They do a great job cutting my son&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> this wahl professional 8329 essentials combo...</li>
            <li> So far no issues.  </li>
            <li> This wahl trimmer cuts as close a shave as my old trimmer and will finish the job every time because of the cord.  </li>
            <li> I wish i had my old ones</li>
            <li> Professional clippers.</li>
            <li> The shaver completely died within 7 months.</li>
            <li> Seems very durable, but I&#x27;ve only used it once.</li>
            <li> the metal clippers don&#x27;t feel completely rounded/smooth around the edges.</li>
            <li> far as performance, this thing is a beast.</li>
            <li> If  you want professional clippers that can cut like razors....</li>
            <li> It should trim lower than the clippers do, which it doesn&#x27;t- and it almost has a snagging on all of my hair no matter how far I adjusted the blade in either direction.  </li>
            <li> He had to finish the cut with his old clipper.  </li>
            <li> I cannot trim my four year old with this device.</li>
            <li> Works good and hasn&#x27;t failed me yet.</li>
            <li> As in not like any other trimmers worth a dime!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a review, here, about a Mother with three kids.</li>
            <li> A very heavy to handle it but the strong.</li>
            <li> Watched a YouTube video on cutting one&#x27;s own hair and went to work!  </li>
            <li> I had to replace my old, dull clippers, and this set fit the bill to a T.</li>
            <li> -- Replacd both since the new ones came as a set at a terrific price.</li>
            <li> I started out with some cheap $20 dollar ones and have had a few mid range clippers from there</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t get hot or loud,like my other Wahl clipper did.</li>
            <li> As a reference I would say I have medium to fine hair, so others may want to opine on how well it performs on thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Have a complete line of attachments for different lengths of the haircut.</li>
            <li> The product has some updates from our last one has the newer, improved attachment combs, as well as the new, adjustment lever on the larger clipper.</li>
            <li> I was excited to have a new trimmer as I broke my previous one a few years back and never replaced it.  </li>
            <li> They are quiet, both the clipper and the trimmer are much quieter, similar to what you hear from the professional barber, very sharp and just work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and now I wish I had bought it sooner instead of using my old ones for so long.</li>
            <li> I only repeated it once to make sure there weren&#x27;t any longer hairs left behind.  </li>
            <li> It seems like this will last me a long time, though I do wonder whether the guards (which have very bendy plastic teeth) will last as long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They went right through my hair, which is usually cut every 2 weeks even after waiting 3 weeks this time.</li>
            <li> This would cost over $100 at the stores and I usually don&#x27;t spend more than $30 at the stores, so I decided to spend a little extra money this time.   </li>
            <li> Highly recommended for other neophytes, like myself!</li>
            <li> We have been using Wahl brand for the past 10 yrs at least and have been always satisfied with the brand products.</li>
            <li> but the trimmer is no different from the razor edge trimmer that wahl has to break it all down its the blades on this set that need upgrading to make this set professional</li>
            <li> It seems to drag on the skin pretty hard even if you&#x27;re just barely brushing it.</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace my old Wahl trimmer, (which broke at the motor/blade transfer point -- not worth fixing).</li>
            <li> if i had one complaint its that i feel the plastic guards are a little on the cheap side.</li>
            <li> A little loud but works well.</li>
            <li> not professional.</li>
            <li> But, hey, if they gave us a bag that had a place for both the clippers and the trimmers and their long, long cords, as well as all the guards, the oil, and anything else</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had them too long, but I&#x27;ve used them twice</li>
            <li> The trimmer is a great addition and it cuts very well for the base of his head, behind the ears and sideburns&lt;</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money two day of use they start burning so bad, even the sound changes than when i first received it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews stating the same thing.</li>
            <li> So, my opinion is that this Wahl Clipper does not have the same quality as the other I had before.</li>
            <li> so I used clippers on a daily basic I don&#x27;t care for the trimmers they are a little heavy&amp;Big</li>
            <li> However, I only started using it only few months after receiving.</li>
            <li> I imagine the packaging keeps the cost down, but it is difficult to keep this kit organized and easy to stow.</li>
            <li> I bought the set back in August and have used them half a dozen times so its paid for itself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen some other reviews about the motor getting hot and hard to hold after a few minutes of use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the type of person who would rather pay a little extra for quality.</li>
            <li> The only reason I wouldn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because they were &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; but had a little rust on the blades.  </li>
            <li> I decided on this item as my old ones were getting dull and wanted to have a trimmer that was not rechargeable.  </li>
            <li> The guards are VERY pointed and would not work well for cutting a young child as they will poke them&lt;br</li>
            <li> There kinda quite at least quiter my old wahls.</li>
            <li> Keeping a well groomed haircut is a must when you are in the military.</li>
            <li> The wahl product makes lot of noise than I expected it to n be.</li>
            <li> I was very worried it would be of poor quality, like others that had been given to me.</li>
            <li> There is really no pockets ,or compartments for all the trimmer heads.</li>
            <li> i have pretty thick hair that seems to destroy the clippers i buy off the shelf!</li>
            <li> They bogged down on the first use, and none of them have thick hair.</li>
            <li> Upon closer examination they weren&#x27;t assembled correctly, the cutting blade was slightly higher than the bigger, stationary blade.</li>
            <li> They are not as sharp as I thought a wahl product would be.</li>
            <li> Window has closed for returning the item!</li>
            <li> I bought this set for my father and he uses them every other day.</li>
            <li> But they do not come out the box as sharp as they could be.</li>
            <li> I need trimmers for my beard and clippers dedicated to a SHARP line up.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever wasted serious time in basic stores looking at clippers or even beauty supplies stores like Sally&#x27;s, or even the supplies stores for actual hair stylists like I have.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s painful to hear when you use it on your head.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer works fine and quieter.</li>
            <li> as least they only miss 1 or 2 peaces.</li>
            <li> I have to go over the same spot at least 5 or 6 times just to miss 1 or 2 peices of hair.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my only complaint</li>
            <li> I usually repeat the area a few extra times.  </li>
            <li> Got tired of battery discharging mid-shave with my old trimmer.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced that so far.  </li>
            <li> They are sharp and require little maintenance.</li>
            <li> Both trimmers worked extremely well!</li>
            <li> The previous pair of Wahl clippers I had for 10+ years</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have had to buy a new trimmer about every 2 years.  </li>
            <li> It began to run a little noisy after a few cuts.  </li>
            <li> No issues, have been using it for a few months and have had no problems.  </li>
            <li> I will probably update this review in a few months.</li>
            <li> Purchased this over a year ago and use it every few weeks to cut my husband&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> The first client I ever used it on said it was painful.</li>
            <li> then it will cut the same as an wahl senior with the trimmers you&#x27;ll have to put a t wide blade on it so you can adjust it to your liking the blade that comes with it can&#x27;t be set/adjusted for close cutting</li>
            <li> Comes with a little carrying case/bag!</li>
            <li> However I usually have to spend $75-150 on it so that must be the difference.</li>
            <li> The small trimmer works well around ears and the neck.</li>
            <li> I usually stick with Andis brand.</li>
            <li> not sure if the description says or not</li>
            <li> After learning how to professionally cut hair through a couple of youtube videos, I am now cutting my boys hair myself.</li>
            <li> I live in another country, I believe it will be very difficult to return this merchandise to have it exchanged.</li>
            <li> and it is very heavy.  </li>
            <li> I have found out the hard way</li>
            <li> Just one complaint</li>
            <li> it since stopped cutting properly.</li>
            <li> No more hassles!</li>
            <li> i like the big cutters but the small clippers that came suck soooooo bad</li>
            <li> This trimmer is very loud and annoying.</li>
            <li> I am not happy at all with the company with whom I bought this from.</li>
            <li> The product took two weeks to get, then it was broken.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it about a dozen times and each time it pulls my clients hair even worse.</li>
            <li> The point is that I am not happy with it.</li>
            <li> I shopped these Wahl trimmers this time online and Amazon is the least expensive.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed that it was trimming the hair without leaving longer ones behind.  </li>
            <li> My wife has been cutting my hair for the past 6+ years.</li>
            <li> I feel bad about this purchase despite reading previous reviews</li>
            <li> I would recommend these to anyone cutting hair at home, they are well built, solid clippers that you will not be disappointed with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Both items were used three times per week for head and beard for approximately forty years without fail.</li>
            <li> but i could be wrong.</li>
            <li> I want to return this useless thing.</li>
            <li> My husband OBSESSED..</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m still bracing for the unlikely.</li>
            <li> i do not know if it is a quality issue or if it is something that i am doing wrong.</li>
            <li> I just turn on my Wahl cutting Hair machine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my 4 sons and husbands hair for 13 years.</li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t have time,i am working in the ship.so for me very difficult to return.</li>
            <li> This set is absolutely atrocious.</li>
            <li> am really disappointed.</li>
            <li> but the trimmer is crap, i kept it the storage bag that comes with it</li>
            <li> I hate this item.</li>
            <li> Disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed and out $50</li>
            <li> These are terrible</li>
            <li> My son was jumping because of the clippers cutting his head!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> High Noise and vibration</li>
            <li> Cut both kids hair.  Doesn&#x27;t get hot at all...nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small Trimmer is great..doesn&#x27;t give the kids friction but like the cheap one we had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even cut my hair with it...and it worked good.  But, then again I make everything look good.</li>
            <li> Wahl has a great reputation and compared to the other clippers I&#x27;ve owned these are a definite improvement. They do a great job cutting my son&#x27;s hair. The reason I gave it 4 stars is I haven&#x27;t been able to get the small clippers to work adequately. I will write back in the future if this changes.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy professional clipper set, just like barbers use.</li>
            <li> very pleased, well made easy to use.  if i had one complaint its that i feel the plastic guards are a little on the cheap side. you know the plastic doesn&#x27;t feel like it will hold up to a lot of abuse. but i could be wrong.</li>
            <li> Quality Quality Quality, these will pay for themselves in about a year.</li>
            <li> Its been perfect items for me this wahl professional 8329 essentials combo... its not getting hot and its light fit for my hand</li>
            <li> Good quality product  worth the money&lt;br /&gt;professional quality heavy duty works just great better than cheap brands&lt;br /&gt;like conair great</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy cheap clippers and regret it later, these are the best set of trimmers I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
            <li> Nothing left to say but, get this product&lt;br /&gt;Save the trip, the time, the money and the wait.&lt;br /&gt;Using it and loving it still. Guys get it.</li>
            <li> Cheaper at amazon than anywhere else. Purchased as gift for someone, and he loves it.  Too soon to tell his lasting power.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend&#x27;s bday he loves it!</li>
            <li> I had to replace my old, dull clippers, and this set fit the bill to a T. The clipper itself is excellent, and very easy to maintain. The beard trimmer gets less use, but it is quite precise and easy to use. I look forward to many years of no fuss, no muss buzzcuts with these implements.</li>
            <li> I am not happy at all with the company with whom I bought this from. I received the product and picked up the clippers and it is very heavy.  I decided that I don&#x27;t want it and wanted to return.  Found out that since it not through Amazon that I had to contact the company with whom listed on here.  I sent 2 emails asking them about their return policy and I NEVER heard back from them.  Now the 30 days is up and it&#x27;s mine.  Thanks so much for nothing, BEAUTY4FAMILY. I will make sure that I never buy from that company again.</li>
            <li> Love this clipper set. It works great cuts sharp. I even recommended it to my brother who bought it &amp; loves it. Great price too!</li>
            <li> Great set for the price.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend top dollar &amp; get a high end set.  This one is working fine.  I regularly use it for my hair, as well as my son&#x27;s.  So far no issues.  I&#x27;ll do another review after a year of use.  I&#x27;ve used it about 10 times now.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best clipper I have ever used and now I wish I had bought it sooner instead of using my old ones for so long. My husband is very happy with me now as well!</li>
            <li> The product took two weeks to get, then it was broken.</li>
            <li> Descent clippers for the money, works good, came with a case. Also came with all the essential size attachments needed. The trimmers do a descent job too.</li>
            <li> It feel apart when we took it out of the box. but we got a refund asap. no problem.</li>
            <li> great product to start with I love</li>
            <li> Keeping a well groomed haircut is a must when you are in the military. I cut my partners hair every 3 weeks. With the new trimmers, they did not leave any &amp;#34;stragglers&amp;#34;, much like a professional cut. Very very pleased with the performance and price point.</li>
            <li> Work Great! Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed! Great price and would buy again!</li>
            <li> i like the big cutters but the small clippers that came suck soooooo bad and i can&#x27;t believe it cause wahl usually is great</li>
            <li> The liners aren&#x27;t sharp but the clippers are very good</li>
            <li> My wife has been cutting my hair for the past 6+ years. We have used three sets of clippers and these are by far the best. They are quiet, both the clipper and the trimmer are much quieter, similar to what you hear from the professional barber, very sharp and just work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They went right through my hair, which is usually cut every 2 weeks even after waiting 3 weeks this time. The trimmer is razor sharp and easily cuts all the fine hairs and details around my ears and neck. I will update the review every couple of months regarding the sharpness of the blades and anything new we run into with these clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are much higher quality than what you will find at Wal-Mart or Target. I would recommend these to anyone cutting hair at home, they are well built, solid clippers that you will not be disappointed with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/1 - I have had 2 hair cuts with these clippers and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Nice smooth cut with minimal effort. My wife really likes these clippers better than our older cheaper ones as they are much sharper and QUIETER. My hair grows more evenly as well, when it comes time for my next haircut, I dont look like such a mess : )</li>
            <li> good price good product</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and professional kit.  Got tired of battery discharging mid-shave with my old trimmer. This wahl trimmer cuts as close a shave as my old trimmer and will finish the job every time because of the cord.  No more hassles!</li>
            <li> They cut well and light. worth the buy.</li>
            <li> Clippers miss alot of hair I wish i had my old ones as least they only miss 1 or 2 peaces. These are terrible I have to go over the same spot at least 5 or 6 times just to miss 1 or 2 peices of hair. There kinda quite at least quiter my old wahls. Trimmers cut close not razor blade close though.</li>
            <li> Professional clippers. Love the combo set...using it today.</li>
            <li> When I opened this package the clippers had fingerprints on them and in between the blades it looked dirty.(looked because I have cleaned them since opening). They are not as sharp as I thought a wahl product would be. I like them because they are better than my last clippers but they are not the best and I will continue to shop for something better.</li>
            <li> Awesome! I use it for my husband and son and works amazing.</li>
            <li> Ive been cutting my own hair for about 6 years now and ive always used Wahl brand clippers. I started out with some cheap $20 dollar ones and have had a few mid range clippers from there and I have to say that THESE are the best ones out there! The trimmer also gives me that fresh and crisp line up that I like and I can get real technical with these clippers. I can honestly say that you will not regret this purchase! Top of the line for Wahl indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both clippers are made from durable plastic (though the trimmers seem alittle on the cheap side from the material that is used, but they give a grade A performance). They are sharp and require little maintenance.</li>
            <li> It took one day to deliver the machine works like a dream am really really satisfied You get what you pay for am so satisfied</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace my old Wahl trimmer, (which broke at the motor/blade transfer point -- not worth fixing). And my old Wahl clipper, which was still working just fine . . . Both items were used three times per week for head and beard for approximately forty years without fail. -- Replacd both since the new ones came as a set at a terrific price. After two weeks use, I&#x27;m very happy with the new set I received with the newer, improved attachment combs, as well as the new, adjustment lever on the larger clipper. Here&#x27;s to another forty years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** Update!!! **** After using this set -- I have to say that the clipper pulls my beard and the (unadjustable) trimmer cuts my ears! . . . I&#x27;ve read other reviews stating the same thing. Hey Wahl, where&#x27;s your quality control department -- asleep at the wheel?</li>
            <li> The shaver completely died within 7 months. Very disappointed. The physical quality looked great.</li>
            <li> Now i can cut my hair myself and dont have no pay to anybody for that. I just turn on my Wahl cutting Hair machine and that&#x27;s all! Is very easy to use. A very heavy to handle it but the strong.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, My wife used to cut my hair 3 times so far.</li>
            <li> Great product. Cuts very nice</li>
            <li> VERY SATISFIED!&lt;br /&gt; smooth finish &amp; quit!&lt;br /&gt;thank you, hi5</li>
            <li> Seems very durable, but I&#x27;ve only used it once.</li>
            <li> works great.. but the liners could of been better</li>
            <li> This set is absolutely atrocious. I&#x27;ve used it about a dozen times and each time it pulls my clients hair even worse. The first client I ever used it on said it was painful. That goes for the trimmers and clippers! I have been buying Wahl clippers for years and have never had an issue. However I usually have to spend $75-150 on it so that must be the difference.</li>
            <li> Good product and fair price, would recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Love these. Have lasted many years so far and they are still going strong. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Clippers for edges could be sharper and when I received them they had hair on them. That&#x27;s my only complaint</li>
            <li> I neglected to keep it oiled initially.  It began to run a little noisy after a few cuts.  Keep it clean and oiled and it will cut well and run quite.</li>
            <li> i bought 220 volt but i found 110 volt and also this trimmer make so noise i want to return but i don&#x27;t have time,i am working in the ship.so for me very difficult to return.</li>
            <li> I bought this set of wall clippers to clean up my hairy neck between hair cuts and to buzz my head instead of paying $10-15 every 6 weeks. I bought the set back in August and have used them half a dozen times so its paid for itself. I&#x27;m the type of person who would rather pay a little extra for quality. This set is high quality and industrial strength: contains 6 length clips, fine trimmers, regular clippers, and oil for the blades. Wahl advises oiling the blade with a drop each time you use them but I oil them every 3-4 times. Each clipper has a cord of about 3&#x27; which is great cause there are no batteries, rechargeable batteries, or battery lengths to deal with. The clippers get warm but not hot after about 30 minutes. The fine trimmers are also convenient for other areas of body hair. If you want to pay yourself many times over order these durable, high quality clippers.</li>
            <li> Works very well &amp; very satisfied by how fast I had recieved my item.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money two day of use they start burning so bad, even the sound changes than when i first received it. And according to They description said this item was new but when i received it, i saw some hair on them. I want to return this useless thing.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this for my husband at Christmas and haven&#x27;t written the review until now. Anyone on the fence that&#x27;s considering this Wahl double set- GET IT!  If you&#x27;ve ever wasted serious time in basic stores looking at clippers or even beauty supplies stores like Sally&#x27;s, or even the supplies stores for actual hair stylists like I have. (The stores like Cosmo Prof where you have to have a card that your a stylist to even get in ). Look no longer ! Honestly my initial hesitation had to do with the fact that I felt I was getting too good of a deal with this set for my money. I wondered could this set really be AMAZING?  Well indeed it is. My husband OBSESSED.. Me we&#x27;ll I&#x27;m even more obsessed. The clippers are exceptional never glitchy always strong and powerful. The attachments you receive with the set are perfect and the extra clippers are perfect for clean lines on the neck, my hubby personally loves for his face !! And when the set came it&#x27;s such a great presentation !  These clippers get used in my household twice a month, and I did purchase a bottle of wahl oil as well and I&#x27;m pleased I did.  The alternative in my mind when I was purchasing this set was a $150 oster duo set glad I went with Wahl never had one issue and if you think your sacrificing quality in price... Think again!!! I chose to write a review today 4 months later because I&#x27;m as happy today with these as I was when I watched my husband open the box on christmas morning.  Wonderful clippers. Would recommend to anyone anywhere anytime!  I hope my review helped anyone on the edge because when you recieve them, you&#x27;ll be so happy you did!</li>
            <li> Very nice product! Love that both of them plug in! Comes with a little carrying case/bag! Cuts and trims very well! Overall very happy with my purchase! Would buy it again in the future!</li>
            <li> I now clip my family hair with ease, both cuts and trimming.  Easy to use and clean with great carrying case included.</li>
            <li> I purchased cheaper bands from walmart, they lasted for three or four hair cuts before issues started. This was is lasting and runs so much better. Its worth the money, already paid for itself and more....</li>
            <li> I purchased this set a month before I started booth renting at my current salon. The neck trimmer&#x27;s stopped working last week after second use. Disappointed! Window has closed for returning the item!</li>
            <li> I received this Wahl Clipper the next day I ordered it. However, I only started using it only few months after receiving. The point is that I am not happy with it. The clipper guide does not fit very well the clipper and the result is that the machine makes a lot off noise. Therefore, using it is a real pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I live in another country, I believe it will be very difficult to return this merchandise to have it exchanged. So, my opinion is that this Wahl Clipper does not have the same quality as the other I had before. Therefore I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Just one complaint (maybe it&#x27;ll go away with time) the metal clippers don&#x27;t feel completely rounded/smooth around the edges. It seems to drag on the skin pretty hard even if you&#x27;re just barely brushing it. No cuts yet, but I&#x27;m still bracing for the unlikely.</li>
            <li> Wahl clippers didn&#x27;t have a smooth cute. wouldn&#x27;t recommend these clippers or trimmer to anyone. not professional. My son was jumping because of the clippers cutting his head!!!</li>
            <li> This is my second Wahl product.  The first one lasted 9 years.  Well built product.  I&#x27;ve seen some other reviews about the motor getting hot and hard to hold after a few minutes of use.  I have not experienced that so far.  Yes it will get alittle warm, but not too hot to hold.</li>
            <li> I have been using Wahl trimmers for over 10 years.  Usually I try not to spend more than $30.00.  However I trim my husband and 3 kids about every 4 weeks or so.  Unfortunately I have had to buy a new trimmer about every 2 years.  Some either miss hair or get very loud.  I shopped these Wahl trimmers this time online and Amazon is the least expensive.  This would cost over $100 at the stores and I usually don&#x27;t spend more than $30 at the stores, so I decided to spend a little extra money this time.   The first thing I noticed when I turned it on was that it was so much quieter than all the others I have purchased.  I also noticed that it was trimming the hair without leaving longer ones behind.  I usually repeat the area a few extra times.  I only repeated it once to make sure there weren&#x27;t any longer hairs left behind.  Also after 4 haircuts back to back the unit was still cool to the touch.  I have bought others that after one cut it&#x27;s warm and by the 4th my hand is burning.  I&#x27;m very pleased so far with the unit.  I hope this one lasts longer.  It&#x27;s already paid for itself after one sitting.  It costs $60 a month for all 4 of them.    Hopefully I can come back a year from now and tell you that it&#x27;s still working great.</li>
            <li> A great buy.these. clippers do a great job.</li>
            <li> very happy i got this the pair is just the best ...</li>
            <li> good quality lots of extras</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had MANY pairs of the cheaper Wahl&#x27;s, I like them, but the cut doesn&#x27;t compare to this pro set.  The detail trimmer is outstanding.</li>
            <li> the clipper is alright but the trimmer is crap, i kept it the storage bag that comes with it and in weeks it got rusted</li>
            <li> I bought this so we could stop spending money at the hair salon to get my husband and kids hair cuts.  This little thing works great!  It works for my husbands hair and my kids and is simple!!  No issues, have been using it for a few months and have had no problems.  Only thing I wish is the kit came with a size five but we make do.</li>
            <li> Bought them for my nephew.  The trimmers are good and sharp but I am not totally sold on the clippers.  I will probably update this review in a few months.</li>
            <li> I bought this item from Amazon in Jan 2012; The clipper it&#x27;s too noisy. It&#x27;s painful to hear when you use it on your head.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer works fine and quieter.</li>
            <li> I imagine the packaging keeps the cost down, but it is difficult to keep this kit organized and easy to stow. I ended up leaving only part of the kit in the cheap bag they provide, with the rest in a drawer for the rare occasion I need it. I mainly cut my own hair and don&#x27;t do anything fancy with it, so I&#x27;m pretty happy to use the main clippers and then 2-3 of the guards to get the right length all around. I might use the trimmers in back, if my wife is around to help make sure it&#x27;s even. But, hey, if they gave us a bag that had a place for both the clippers and the trimmers and their long, long cords, as well as all the guards, the oil, and anything else I&#x27;m forgetting (a brush, I suppose), that would be even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as performance, this thing is a beast. So much easier than what I used to do. Cuts through my hair like a pro (go figure), and it has already paid for itself. It gets a little warm when I take too long to fine tune or something, but that&#x27;s nothing. It&#x27;s easy to keep free of hair and to oil the blades. I was worried that would suck, so I am happy that it&#x27;s minimal extra work at the end of the cut. It seems like this will last me a long time, though I do wonder whether the guards (which have very bendy plastic teeth) will last as long.</li>
            <li> Works really well...have already saved the cost in my own haircuts! Would be nice to have the tapered right and left combs.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Have only used once but seem to be well made and worked like they should. Have a complete line of attachments for different lengths of the haircut.</li>
            <li> My husband is one that at a young age began to loose his hair and now just needs a quick trim and a #2 guard all around. This is a good product for the money and it has saved us money by not going to the barber -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) Comes in a nice case to keep everything together&lt;br /&gt;2) Comes with lots of extras (brush for tiny hairs in the blades, oil and many guards)&lt;br /&gt;3) The trimmer is a great addition and it cuts very well for the base of his head, behind the ears and sideburns&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) The guards are VERY pointed and would not work well for cutting a young child as they will poke them&lt;br /&gt;2) The instructions could be more detailed&lt;br /&gt;3) The cord is somewhat short in my opinion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> these are great clippers.  The price was amazing!! I love them and would recommend them to anyone professional or not!! The only reason I wouldn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because they were &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; but had a little rust on the blades.  I buffed it out and they are fine.  But I was concerned about that.  You can also buy replacements. So not a big deal.  The motor is amazing and cuts hair quick.</li>
            <li> The previous pair of Wahl clippers I had for 10+ years and they are still running, I could just add new blades.  If  you want professional clippers that can cut like razors....these are the way to go......</li>
            <li> No problems, they run nice and quiet and cool. Working flawlessly. Don&#x27;t know what the noise complaints are about! Used to cut both mine and my sons&#x27; hair!</li>
            <li> Great and fast delivery. Good product, works as expected.A little loud but works well.The small trimmer works well around ears and the neck.</li>
            <li> They cut very well and do not get very warm at all.  They are very quiet.  I would highly recommend this product to anybody looking for a great pair of clippers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my 4 sons and husbands hair for 13 years. DO NOT buy these clippers. They bogged down on the first use, and none of them have thick hair. I went to trim the neck with no guard and the clippers instantly drew blood. Upon closer examination they weren&#x27;t assembled correctly, the cutting blade was slightly higher than the bigger, stationary blade. They arrived at my door that way. My son is now wearing a scab with the proof. Buy the Wahl Designer, we&#x27;ve had it for 12 years and it&#x27;s just starting to wear out. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to do!</li>
            <li> The wahl product makes lot of noise than I expected it to n be. Also when I turn it on, the blades shake and makes a quick loud noise . Am not impressed at all because I read all the wonderful comments that people posted about the product before I purchased it, so I had high expectations for the machine.but now am really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Received this 4 days before the date indicated for arrival. Both trimmers worked extremely well!</li>
            <li> These clippers are fantastic.  I&#x27;ve used them for several months and have been quite happy.  Watched a YouTube video on cutting one&#x27;s own hair and went to work!  The clippers are smooth, cut well, and the attachments snap on and off tightly, but easily.  Highly recommended for other neophytes, like myself!</li>
            <li> Very nice package for a good price.  Comes with a carrying case to keep everything in the same place and easy to find.  The clipper is solid and significantly more powerful than my previous one (*almart all in one kit).  Build quality seems solid and reliable on both clippers.  I gave it 4 stars only because I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to report on longevity, but I would happily recommend these.  As a reference I would say I have medium to fine hair, so others may want to opine on how well it performs on thick hair.  Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> This was the first trimmer I have ever bought. I was very worried it would be of poor quality, like others that had been given to me. Thankfully that was not the case. After a quick application of oil, I proceeded to completely cut my full head of hair. The clippers cut right through everything I put in front of it.&lt;br /&gt;However, now I need a new one, because I dropped it and it since stopped cutting properly. This is a very good product and I have been very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> this was a gift love every thing work very goog</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers and trimmers for my grandson for Christmas.  He loved it and said he will use them to trim all of his kids&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li> The clippers did not work. lost money on this item. hey the edgers. worked.</li>
            <li> daughter loves it woks perfect</li>
            <li> Use it all the time to cut my 4 guys&#x27; hair. Works good and hasn&#x27;t failed me yet. Good purchase.</li>
            <li> awesome equipment at an affordable price. Brand is the best ever, long lasting. One of the greatest purchases I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li> Like everyone else i&#x27;ve tried the Walmart brand clippers and these are a huge upgrade. Haven&#x27;t had them too long, but I&#x27;ve used them twice and they worked great. They never got warm and they cut good . I don&#x27;t know what else to say,but I love&#x27;em</li>
            <li> I bought Wahl because they are the best trimmers out there. These two are even better than I expected from the best. Why? Because not only do they come with all the attachments, they are actually very quiet! As in not like any other trimmers worth a dime!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a review, here, about a Mother with three kids. she commented on the quiet-ness and the heat. These do not get hot. They are comparitvely quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price, beat the local Wally World by $5. With Prime, one can&#x27;t miss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would HIGHLY recommend this product to all, friend or foe!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about six months now and still working great.  I have not had any problems with product.</li>
            <li> Great value for the price and delivered on time. The different sized clippers make any shaving job a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Only used the smaller trimmer but it worked great so far. All the attachments were great too</li>
            <li> Work well but you&#x27;ll likely need to special order more attachments to get the trimming lengths you want</li>
            <li> The Taper 2000 actually gets a 5 star post, however the trimmer that comes with is garbage.  It should trim lower than the clippers do, which it doesn&#x27;t- and it almost has a snagging on all of my hair no matter how far I adjusted the blade in either direction.  I was excited to have a new trimmer as I broke my previous one a few years back and never replaced it.  But, the Taper 2000 is perfect, and all attachments snap on very securely.</li>
            <li> Appears to cut ok but I may have some issues with the metallurgy of the smaller trimmer it seems to rust easy even with oil.</li>
            <li> We have been using Wahl brand for the past 10 yrs at least and have been always satisfied with the brand products. This is by far one of the best clippers we have ever used and my husband is very happy with the product. The product has some updates from our last one has the newer, improved attachment combs, as well as the new, adjustment lever on the larger clipper. The price on Amazon is much more reasonable than all the other stores.</li>
            <li> this clipper kit is decent. one issue im having is that the clipper sometimes wont work(it would turn on but wouldn&#x27;t cut any hair). i do not know if it is a quality issue or if it is something that i am doing wrong. i clean it after every use and it is stored in a safe/dry place.</li>
            <li> good product! i have pretty thick hair that seems to destroy the clippers i buy off the shelf! this one been working great since it came out of the box. still strong as ever and a clean shave!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Makes giving a haircut sooo easy. Very sharp blades, neck trimmer is so nice. Bought two one for me and one for daughter to cut&lt;br /&gt;my grandsons&#x27; hair. Really does make it so easy to cut hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut my own hair since I was 14...these have been the best clippers I&#x27;ve found especially considering the price. Great quality, cuts through thick hair like butter! And the smaller trimmer is great for edging</li>
            <li> My brother has it and so does my father!!! I recommended</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist so I used clippers on a daily basic I don&#x27;t care for the trimmers they are a little heavy&amp;Big had to get use to handling them.</li>
            <li> these functioning electric clippers work really fine for each type of hair cut we need and the clipper neads are great for all the height of haircuts needed, Very good produce for people in the know.</li>
            <li> Great combo purchase. Especially for the price. I bought this set for my father and he uses them every other day. The clippers are powerful. the trimmers...trim. But they do not come out the box as sharp as they could be. Youtube how to adjust trimmers for a closer cut. Its not hard. I will say out of the box they are fine for a close beard shave cut. But if you are looking for line up clippers, they have to be adjusted. I will purchase this set for my self. I usually stick with Andis brand. But this price is great. I need trimmers for my beard and clippers dedicated to a SHARP line up. I have found out the hard way, they I can not use the same trimmers to shave my beard as I do my line up.</li>
            <li> Initial impression is excellent.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price .</li>
            <li> I bought this for my adult grandson and he loves it , it seems to do a fine job on his hair.</li>
            <li> Love this buzzer I wish the plastic pieces were a little more durable but I love that the machine does not over heat.</li>
            <li> The quality of the product is outstanding. I would be using this clippers for many years to come. They are perfect.</li>
            <li> Great service. The package came on the day indicated in the confirmation  and the clippers work as described. Thanks again..</li>
            <li> Purchased this over a year ago and use it every few weeks to cut my husband&#x27;s hair.  When I purchased it I also purchased some oil... not sure if the description says or not but ours came with oil - no need to buy more.  Great purchase!</li>
            <li> I hate this item. It is literally ripping the hair out of my sons head. I&#x27;ve adjusted it and not helping. They won&#x27;t take the item back I&#x27;m very disappointed and out $50</li>
            <li> Clips very fast and perfect for my small dog. Small clippers work really good to get close on her feet.&lt;br /&gt;Much better then the old Oster ones I use to use.</li>
            <li> Received item quickly, and was exactly as pictured.  I used to have a trimmer that was battery powered and always was running out of power.  I decided on this item as my old ones were getting dull and wanted to have a trimmer that was not rechargeable.  We have been very pleased so far!</li>
            <li> this equipment is defective has an internal noise and blade broke,&lt;br /&gt;not recommend this purchase , and i need return part, for that return to me the merchandise good status.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with these clippers thus far. Married to a Marine, so we use these every week.  Much better than the previous cheap clippers used.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> We have only use it twice but it&#x27;s the best clippers we have ever bought</li>
            <li> We tried using it and it didn&#x27;t work.  it wouldn&#x27;t glide smoothly over my husband&#x27;s head.  He had to finish the cut with his old clipper.  We promptly returned it and ordered another Andis</li>
            <li> This trimmer is very loud and annoying. I cannot trim my four year old with this device. I feel bad about this purchase despite reading previous reviews</li>
            <li> Great set the clipper is no different from any other wahl clipper except for the blade you can upgrade it by putting a taper blade on it then it will cut the same as an wahl senior with the trimmers you&#x27;ll have to put a t wide blade on it so you can adjust it to your liking the blade that comes with it can&#x27;t be set/adjusted for close cutting but the trimmer is no different from the razor edge trimmer that wahl has to break it all down its the blades on this set that need upgrading to make this set professional but if for home use then this will be great I&#x27;m a barber so I keep extra blades and can save money with this set</li>
            <li> I must say this is an item of amazing value. If god had long hair, he&#x27;d use a Wahl to fade and trim to look good! o yeah. Wahl rules.</li>
            <li> After learning how to professionally cut hair through a couple of youtube videos, I am now cutting my boys hair myself. Great Product! Saves a lot of money!</li>
            <li> Works good,Like the trimmer,too.I didn&#x27;t use the pouch it came with.I think it&#x27;s too small to hold everything good.There is really no pockets ,or compartments for all the trimmer heads.Anyway they work great.They don&#x27;t get hot or loud,like my other Wahl clipper did.The cord look thicker and better. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I have several months using it and it turned out a good buy, is quiet and economic, would recommend.</li>
