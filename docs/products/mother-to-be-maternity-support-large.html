            <li>so I returned it for an XL which is perfect.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it could offer the awesome support that it does though without being a bit bulky, so this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m so happy about the difference this product makes for me.</li>
            <li>, here&#x27;s the not so great things.</li>
            <li>LOL.</li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>the product is of good quality, sturdy and does the job-holds your belly while you&#x27;re growing.</li>
            <li>I have been very satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>I love it and have recommended it for years!</li>
            <li>with great success.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;m carrying twins, I ordered a large, and it fits great.  </li>
            <li>It helped remove a lot of pressure off the pelvis and hips and helped me walk better.</li>
            <li>It helps best if you wear it daily.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve gone on about what I love</li>
            <li>I bought a belly band to wear underneath because the top edge would scratch and annoy me.</li>
            <li>any maternity belt, they work better with under belly pants for access to bathroom breaks</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t had to wash it as I wear a tank top underneath</li>
            <li>It is also not the most comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>My belt was shipped Fed Ex for free and received very quickly.</li>
            <li>I loved my belt so much I sent one to my pregnant sister.</li>
            <li>Activities that require bending - sweeping, mopping, changing diapers, giving hugs, etc...are a huge part of my day every day.</li>
            <li>I was 35, not in great shape, and he was a BIG baby</li>
            <li>Sometimes, even when wearing it, I still get pains, but more often than not, the belt really, really helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The days that I wear it I&#x27;m good for my entire work day, which is until 5:00pm.</li>
            <li>I also found I didn&#x27;t really need the band that went over the top of my belly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a worthy investment.</li>
            <li>I wish I had known that products like this existed when I was pregnant with my son.</li>
            <li>When you first begin wearing it it might take two or three days to start feeling the full effect of lessening soreness.</li>
            <li>Even with that though, it&#x27;s still worth it to me.</li>
            <li>I am so excited by how much this product has helped.</li>
            <li>I try to remember to put this on first thing in the morning before kiddos arrive.</li>
            <li>Mother-To-Be is definitely the better of the two.  </li>
            <li>I am fairly confident that the size will last through the twin pregnancy.</li>
            <li>-&lt;br /&gt;It does have multiple pieces and straps that can be a bit tricky to get in and out of, however I feel the flexibility it offers is more important than the circus dance getting in and out of it.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>They were the last 2 and because of this belt I was able to take care of my older kids and keep my back happy at the same time.</li>
            <li>After receiving it and wearing it a full day, my back pain was significantly reduced.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I can&#x27;t say enough good things.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this belt for any pregnant women who is having back issues while pregnant.</li>
            <li>When pregnant, I was carrying my baby very far forward, so maternity belts were very helpful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the large and just bought the medium.  </li>
            <li>I ordered a size large as that is the size maternity clothes I wear also.  </li>
            <li>It does make going to the bathroom quickly a bit of a challenge since there are three different parts, but it lifts and supports in all the right places.</li>
            <li>The few things I listed that are not so great would probably be similar cons of any maternity support belt.</li>
            <li>I wonder if there is a way to make the part that the band Velcros to part of the whole thing.</li>
            <li>so got it for free it is helping alot as I&#x27;m having twins and carrying very low</li>
            <li>If I were pregnant with a single child I am absolutely confident that the size would last the whole pregnancy.  </li>
            <li>but I would probably only spot clean it, if I had to.  </li>
            <li>, it does bother me a little bit to wear it without a tank top</li>
            <li>Also it relieves the pressure off your back at least 90 % which is better than most other belts.</li>
            <li>I have a back injury while pregnant and was told by my Physical Therapist to get this support belt.</li>
            <li>so my therapist told me to definitely go with the Large.</li>
            <li>We both had a lot of pain early on and needed this.</li>
            <li>This one is larger than some of the others that I tried, and was helpful in terms of getting the baby off my bladder, but it is really bulky.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have had this belt with 1st child as I had intense back pain that literally handicapped me to the bed.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t lay totally flat to give you a smooth belly look, but that is to be expected, and frankly I really don&#x27;t care as my back isn&#x27;t hurting</li>
            <li>This is a concrete example of how much weight this support is actually taking off of my lower back.    </li>
            <li>My only complaint was that it was more than one piece.</li>
            <li>larger back support area really makes you sit correctly</li>
            <li>This time around I discovered this product around 4 months pregnant and decided to go ahead and get it so as to prevent going down the same road.</li>
            <li>I think the large is causing a bit of discomfort because the straps reach to the center of my belly.  </li>
            <li>expect it to support of carry the load of your belly, it helps a little but really isn&#x27;t designed for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> This support band did help my lower back considerably during the last half of my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty comfortable, but can be a little awkward to wear when going to the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> strap to position over the belly is way too long, so I haven&#x27;t worn</li>
            <li> For some reason it causes my pants to slide down in the back.</li>
            <li> It took him a while to make his way back down.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It can correct back pain in just a few minutes even if I haven&#x27;t worn it for a couple days&lt;</li>
            <li> I just wish I had it for my other pregnancies.</li>
            <li> I tried one other maternity belt before this one.  </li>
            <li> During that pregnancy any kind of activity that required bending and moving, such as mopping, sweeping the floor, etc...was horrible for me.</li>
            <li> It is a little awkward to put on by myself, not sure if that is do to my back injury or the way the belt is made so it didn&#x27;t get the full 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have had it for my other pregnancies!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can be loosened throughout the day for times when you need a little breather&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> On the days that I forget to wear it, my back is exhausted by about 1:00pm.</li>
            <li> This product does not fit as well as I would like and makes crinkling noises when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather have to hike up my pants a few times than have an exhausted lower back.</li>
            <li> My little bundle was not fond of the fact I had it on, and crawled up away from it and lodged himself into my ribs and lungs!  </li>
            <li> The directions were a little hard to follow</li>
            <li> ..um not sure what to write ..</li>
            <li> but my waist was fairly small</li>
            <li> This was too small and did not stay in place</li>
            <li> I had a really hard time functioning towards the end of my pregnancy.    </li>
            <li> Hardly any support.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 8th month, and there&#x27;s at least 5\\&quot; of expansion room.</li>
            <li> As my back/sciatic pain improved, the support was uncomfortable and later unnecessary when sitting.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Downside of the product - one side has a thick stitch that will embed in my side causing some discomfort.  </li>
            <li> The next day was so unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> My back would hurt so bad afterwards</li>
            <li> i bought it as i had pain in my pelvic floor ,,but i didnot use it at all because its so inconvenient and messy to wear everytime..</li>
            <li> but this one is thin and flimsy.</li>
            <li> Waste of money, very uncomfortable and awkward to wear.</li>
            <li> The wobbliness that happens in pregnancy was not as bad when wearing this item.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to the relief and was highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> That can get a bit annoying.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> ..um not sure what to write .. it may work for you guys...but not for me... as its another tasjk to wear this belt .. i bought it as i had pain in my pelvic floor ,,but i didnot use it at all because its so inconvenient and messy to wear everytime.. so depends.. !!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because I was experiencing a lot of pelvic pain. It helped remove a lot of pressure off the pelvis and hips and helped me walk better. The wobbliness that happens in pregnancy was not as bad when wearing this item. It stabilizes the hips. It helps best if you wear it daily. When you first begin wearing it it might take two or three days to start feeling the full effect of lessening soreness. It&#x27;s a worthy investment.</li>
            <li> At about week 22 of my pregnancy with twins, I started getting severe lower back pains.  My doctor recommended a pregnancy belt.  After receiving it and wearing it a full day, my back pain was significantly reduced.  Sometimes, even when wearing it, I still get pains, but more often than not, the belt really, really helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty comfortable, but can be a little awkward to wear when going to the bathroom.  When I&#x27;m at work, I wear it under clothes, and at home, I wear it over my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before the pregnancy, I was a size 14.  As I&#x27;m carrying twins, I ordered a large, and it fits great.  I&#x27;m in my 8th month, and there&#x27;s at least 5\\&quot; of expansion room.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me during pregnancy by my physical therapist.&lt;br /&gt;It definitely serves its purpose, giving immediate noticeable relief to lower back pain as soon as you put it on.&lt;br /&gt;The strap to position over the belly is way too long, so I haven&#x27;t worn that.&lt;br /&gt;The only heads up when ordering this product is to order a size bigger if you&#x27;re border-line on their charts. I was a size 18 prior to pregnancy but my waist was fairly small so my therapist told me to definitely go with the Large. This was too small and did not stay in place so I returned it for an XL which is perfect.</li>
            <li> This belt was recommended by my dr. and insurance company.  I have been very satisfied with it.  It does make going to the bathroom quickly a bit of a challenge since there are three different parts, but it lifts and supports in all the right places.</li>
            <li> I wish I had known that products like this existed when I was pregnant with my son. During that pregnancy any kind of activity that required bending and moving, such as mopping, sweeping the floor, etc...was horrible for me. My back would hurt so bad afterwards that I would end up resting it the entire next day after such an activity. I had a really hard time functioning towards the end of my pregnancy.    This time around I discovered this product around 4 months pregnant and decided to go ahead and get it so as to prevent going down the same road. I am so excited by how much this product has helped. I run a home daycare and am constantly moving around all day. Activities that require bending - sweeping, mopping, changing diapers, giving hugs, etc...are a huge part of my day every day. I need to work the entire 9 months so I&#x27;m so happy about the difference this product makes for me. I try to remember to put this on first thing in the morning before kiddos arrive. On the days that I forget to wear it, my back is exhausted by about 1:00pm. The days that I wear it I&#x27;m good for my entire work day, which is until 5:00pm. When I do take this off in the evening I can feel my body shift, meaning my belly falls forward and my upper body bends back to compensate. This is a concrete example of how much weight this support is actually taking off of my lower back.    Now that I&#x27;ve gone on about what I love, here&#x27;s the not so great things. It&#x27;s a bit bulky. I feel a bit like I&#x27;m wearing armor and I definitely feel I need a rest period at the end of the day where I don&#x27;t wear it. I don&#x27;t think it could offer the awesome support that it does though without being a bit bulky, so this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. For some reason it causes my pants to slide down in the back. That can get a bit annoying. I may have to figure out some way to remedy this. Even with that though, it&#x27;s still worth it to me. I&#x27;d rather have to hike up my pants a few times than have an exhausted lower back.The few things I listed that are not so great would probably be similar cons of any maternity support belt. Overall, I can&#x27;t say enough good things. If you&#x27;re thinking you need something like this, stop thinking and start purchasing. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> This support band did help my lower back considerably during the last half of my pregnancy. My only complaint was that it was more than one piece. I wonder if there is a way to make the part that the band Velcros to part of the whole thing. I also found I didn&#x27;t really need the band that went over the top of my belly.</li>
            <li> This was a lifesaver during my 2nd pregnancy. I was 35, not in great shape, and he was a BIG baby LOL. Wish I&#x27;d had it for my 1st!</li>
            <li> Waste of money, very uncomfortable and awkward to wear. I was looking forward to the relief and was highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> My belt was shipped Fed Ex for free and received very quickly. I loved my belt so much I sent one to my pregnant sister. She loves hers too. It has given us both some mobility we didn&#x27;t have before. I am on my fifth child and she is on her fourth. We both had a lot of pain early on and needed this. I just wish I had it for my other pregnancies.</li>
            <li> I used this support system with 2 out of 4 pregnancies! They were the last 2 and because of this belt I was able to take care of my older kids and keep my back happy at the same time. It not only saved my back but helped me with my posture... I love it and have recommended it for years!</li>
            <li> Works well for standing all day, but not for sitting. I bought a belly band to wear underneath because the top edge would scratch and annoy me.</li>
            <li> My docter prescribed me this brace so got it for free it is helping alot as I&#x27;m having twins and carrying very low</li>
            <li> I immediately felt the improvement in all my pains reduced or gone.  I was experiencing groin pain on my left side and constant pelvic.  In addition to cramping and numbness in my legs at night.  I wore it immediately and slept with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the large and just bought the medium.  I think the large is causing a bit of discomfort because the straps reach to the center of my belly.  The pics show the straps on the side of the belly.  My fault.&lt;br /&gt;I do have some itchiness that can be solved with a belly wrap.  Which I have purchased today but still haven&#x27;t had a chance to put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downside of the product - one side has a thick stitch that will embed in my side causing some discomfort.  Resolved by moving it.</li>
            <li> A must have for preggos with back issues or for those preggos that carry their babies low!  It saved me during my pregnancy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend wearing during the night to sleep.  The one night I went to bed with it on, I was 7 months along. My little bundle was not fond of the fact I had it on, and crawled up away from it and lodged himself into my ribs and lungs!  The next day was so unpleasant.  It took him a while to make his way back down.  LOL</li>
            <li> the product is of good quality, sturdy and does the job-holds your belly while you&#x27;re growing. Also it relieves the pressure off your back at least 90 % which is better than most other belts.</li>
            <li> This product does not fit as well as I would like and makes crinkling noises when I wear it. It is also not the most comfortable to wear. I have noticed increased back pain when I wear it. Would not purchase or recommend although maybe it would work for others?</li>
            <li> Helped a lot with my sciatic nerve pain and SPD during pregnancy! Wish I would have had it for my other pregnancies!</li>
            <li> When pregnant, I was carrying my baby very far forward, so maternity belts were very helpful. This one is larger than some of the others that I tried, and was helpful in terms of getting the baby off my bladder, but it is really bulky.</li>
            <li> I tried one other maternity belt before this one.  Mother-To-Be is definitely the better of the two.  I am expecting twins as my 2nd and 3rd children.  I wish I would have had this belt with 1st child as I had intense back pain that literally handicapped me to the bed.  I ordered a size large as that is the size maternity clothes I wear also.  It fits well and has plenty of room to grow and adjust.  If I were pregnant with a single child I am absolutely confident that the size would last the whole pregnancy.  I am fairly confident that the size will last through the twin pregnancy. Before pregnancy I am 5&#x27; 6.5&amp;#34; and 150 lbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect it to support of carry the load of your belly, it helps a little but really isn&#x27;t designed for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros -&lt;br /&gt;Keeps your back and posture correct to limit back pain&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s multiple pieces give you lots of room for adjustment&lt;br /&gt;The larger back support area really makes you sit correctly&lt;br /&gt;It can correct back pain in just a few minutes even if I haven&#x27;t worn it for a couple days&lt;br /&gt;It can be loosened throughout the day for times when you need a little breather&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons -&lt;br /&gt;It does have multiple pieces and straps that can be a bit tricky to get in and out of, however I feel the flexibility it offers is more important than the circus dance getting in and out of it.&lt;br /&gt;With any maternity belt, they work better with under belly pants for access to bathroom breaks&lt;br /&gt;While this belt isn&#x27;t scratchy, it does bother me a little bit to wear it without a tank top underneath.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t lay totally flat to give you a smooth belly look, but that is to be expected, and frankly I really don&#x27;t care as my back isn&#x27;t hurting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had to wash it as I wear a tank top underneath but I would probably only spot clean it, if I had to.  It might lose its shape otherwise.</li>
            <li> I have a back injury while pregnant and was told by my Physical Therapist to get this support belt. It helps elevate some of the weight/pulling in my back do to my growing stomach. It is a little awkward to put on by myself, not sure if that is do to my back injury or the way the belt is made so it didn&#x27;t get the full 5 stars. I find the belt easier to use when my husband assist me in putting it on. I would recommend this belt for any pregnant women who is having back issues while pregnant.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on the advice of my physical therapist for sciatic pain during my 3rd trimester (4th baby).  The directions were a little hard to follow and I was grateful for the confirmation of my P/T.  As soon as I put it on, I couldn&#x27;t believe I ever went through a pregnancy without using this!!  As my back/sciatic pain improved, the support was uncomfortable and later unnecessary when sitting.  However, I would still use the support if I needed to move around alot (cooking, cleaning, groceries, etc.) with great success. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Thought this was the same one my physical therapist recommended but this one is thin and flimsy. Hardly any support.</li>
