            <li>/&gt;Having read the reviews about the edges, right out of the box I took a nail file and dulled the edges as best</li>
            <li>The plates are of the best quality, the prints are deep and catch the polish well, equaling very good transfer to a stamper and then to your nail.</li>

            <li>I own konad, both bundle monster sets, Chez Delaney,  and Mash.</li>

            <li>The good thing is that I just bought contact paper and stuck it to the back, works perfectly!! :)</li>
            <li>These stamped okay and had nice designs.</li>

            <li>I am a COMPLETE Nail junky and Soon to be nail tech :) For the price and quantity... its a great buy!</li>
            <li>I am also VERY pleased with how quickly they came in the mail!</li>
            <li>Of course there are designs I will never use on my own nails, but I think I will eventually use most of the designs, which makes me believe this was a worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li>There is a bow on one of the plates that has been a huge hit and it has a very dainty lace design on it and that comes off the plate and onto the nail very</li>

            <li>They are a great set to start with if you are interested in stamping &amp; are not too picky about your nails.</li>
            <li>These are very cheap compared to the Konad stamps.  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely love the designs on the plates, the designs pick up easy on your stamper with any kind of polish.</li>
            <li>but the images are beautiful and I can&#x27;t wait for new ones from this company!</li>

            <li>I receive many compliments my nails</li>
            <li>I cannot wait for them to make more plates.</li>

            <li>There are some incredibly cute designs.</li>
            <li>Although the emoticons are kinda cute</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite pleased and hope they come out with another set.</li>
            <li>The majority of the patterns aren&#x27;t dupes of Konad or Bundle Monster, which is refreshing.</li>
            <li>I am in LOVE with my stamp plates.</li>

            <li>WOULD NOT MIND PAYING A COUPLE OF BUCKS MORE TO ENSURE</li>
            <li>The designs are great &amp; they work very well</li>
            <li>I will try to update after using the product more.  </li>
            <li>Konad, Mash, Salon Express.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I have gotten better, but some of these plates are not etched</li>
            <li>All of the images look awesome and feel like they are deeply engraved.  </li>
            <li>but I feel ok about purchase based on price paid for the amount of plates.</li>
            <li>I hope that the more I use the plates the happier</li>
            <li>I would do business with seller again, but would probably ask for better pictures of product I&#x27;m buying before making my purchase.</li>
            <li>These plate images were fantastic for the price!  </li>
            <li>and i love them.</li>
            <li>you will love them.</li>
            <li>The designs are creative and have lots of variety.</li>
            <li>If all of the plates worked, this would be my favorite image plate set.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When they arrived I fell in love with all the images.</li>
            <li>The price was fantastic for the number of plates I received!</li>
            <li>I am impressed with the overall function and value.</li>
            <li>I love these</li>
            <li>and I must say that they are better than the Konad stamping plates.</li>
            <li>so I put my own backing on them to make them more comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>I really love these plates.</li>
            <li>Most people are.</li>
            <li>:) Just increase them.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>There are so many interesting designs to choose from</li>
            <li>Also, personally, I don&#x27;t have many polishes that are best for stamping.  </li>
            <li>The two floral patterns on RA-109 are my favorite.</li>
            <li>I am working on my Konad collection, but wanted something to hold me over until I get more Konad plates.</li>
            <li>used all Konad polishes, and the images came out ok.</li>
            <li>I love the designs but some of them don&#x27;t come transfer to the rubber applicator.  </li>
            <li>The plates may have worked better with the konad polish or a polish meant for stamping.</li>
            <li>so you could pick up more polish.</li>
            <li>I love these plates and the images.</li>
            <li>love the RA plates</li>
            <li>I love all of the designs, but my favorite it the ones with the bubbles</li>
            <li>:) I have the konad stamper and some konad plates</li>
            <li>so you have to make sure you scrape well</li>
            <li>This set is one of my favorite image plates.</li>
            <li>I think the images at etched deeper into the metal, so the pattern picks up better.</li>
            <li>I received these for Valentine&#x27;s Day from my Husband and I truly Love them...</li>
            <li>and I Love the designs...</li>
            <li>I love them.  </li>
            <li>So much better than Cheeky .</li>
            <li>To compare to some of the better brands this one is ok.</li>
            <li>I love the designs.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I need more fingers.  :-)</li>
            <li>Love the plates............</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>I am looking for to more image plates to come out.  </li>
            <li>When these plates arrived I fell in love with the images.</li>
            <li>Red Angel PLEASE MAKE ANOTHER SET SOON!!!!! :D</li>
            <li>All the stamps are really cute.</li>
            <li>Some of the plates work great, others don&#x27;t seem to transfer very well or at all.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, they are just alright.</li>
            <li>Love the quantity and quality.</li>
            <li>Most that I used worked ..</li>
            <li>but I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re simply stunning..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am very happy and will order more Red Angel plates!</li>
            <li>I love this set and it does its job.</li>
            <li>I have watched many YouTube Videos and have gone to lots of websites to get hints, tricks, and how-tos.  </li>
            <li>Love the designs.</li>
            <li>The designs are great, but I don&#x27;t like spending that much time redoing a nail over and over trying to get it to apply.</li>
            <li>To my pleasant surprise, most of the images are deeply etched, transfer well, and are a nice size!</li>
            <li>the stencil covers the whole nail, a very nice size.</li>
            <li>It was very nice and very neatly packaged.</li>
            <li>Because of the low price I thought I&#x27;d give it a try, and I&#x27;m glad I did!!!   </li>
            <li>Happy to have some new designs!</li>
            <li>These plates are super cute and the designs are very unique!</li>
            <li>My first attempt was pretty successful and am looking forward to using them on my daughters too!</li>
            <li>The designs are fun and new with excellent variety-</li>
            <li>The quality of these plates is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>These are a great value for those who are new to nail stamping like me.</li>
            <li>The price was great and the images are fun, fun, fun!!  </li>
            <li>I strongly reccomend this seller and product :)</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t spent a lot of time using the plates, but after searching the many options out there these nail plates had the best combination of designs.</li>
            <li>Great quality, great stamping, but designs are almost same size as Konad, very small for my nails, but it does have a great variety of designs, even a weed leaf hahaha&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li>Overall, these are very good plates.</li>
            <li>I use them on top of a napkin and that keeps the free edges from being an issue.</li>
            <li>WOW, these are great quality.</li>
            <li>After more than a few hours of trying to get it to work, the best I was able to come up with is some inconsistent transfers.  </li>
            <li>The one&#x27;s that I have used so far work great.  </li>
            <li>All in all, the set has a good variety of images, but since I didn&#x27;t get what I was really hoping for</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are few flowery designs which are great and a large diamond (harlequin) style design which is good because that was always a design i loved on the BM Plate</li>
            <li>the images are clear and the fine detail is great.</li>
            <li>This plates are so cool!</li>
            <li>On first impression: As soon as I opened these plates I was in love!</li>
            <li>other that that they are great.!!</li>
            <li>In all other ways, the quality and value are superb.</li>
            <li>Reasonable postage and thrilled that I was able to have them posted to NZ, and they arrived within a week of ordering.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re so easy to use.</li>
            <li>These plates arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li>great seller on amazon, would definitely go back and order more.</li>
            <li>The plates are sturdy and easy to use.</li>
            <li>If you have a wide selection of colors that are stampable, then this set is fantastic; it still is wonderful without.  </li>
            <li>I hope that with more experience I can get better images, but right now I don&#x27;t know if it is me or the product.  </li>
            <li>The designs are etched deep and the images come out beautifully.</li>
            <li>They are etched deeply for each design and stamp beautifully.  </li>
            <li>I can never cover a full thumb with most of the etched designs...</li>
            <li>I bought this one because it had more full nail designs than the others.</li>
            <li>;( I&#x27;m still keeping the set as there are lots on non full nail images that are adorable</li>
            <li>I love this set, the plates are great, new designs that are fresh and fun!</li>
            <li>The price was fair and they arrived quickly and that is all I can say that is positive.</li>
            <li>They are just fine</li>
            <li>but otherwise super cute images.</li>
            <li>metal of the plates feel of cheap, lower quality but it hasn&#x27;t effected the stamping process, they just don&#x27;t seem as strong as the BM or Konad plates</li>
            <li>These came in the mail quickly!</li>
            <li>The designs seem to be more defined and it makes for very pretty nails.</li>
            <li>So far all the designs I&#x27;ve used have stamped cleanly, and they have great original designs.  </li>
            <li>and I major issues with getting the image to transfer successfully.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting something cheap</li>
            <li>All the plates are one of a kind, no repeats, and stamp real well too.</li>
            <li>The Red Angel Plates that I purchased from this seller stamp great.  </li>
            <li>Some of the patterned designs aren&#x27;t fully stamped out but overall great product</li>
            <li>I added paper backing to the plates to fit my preference.</li>
            <li>, I enjoy them.</li>
            <li>The Red Angel ones are great.  </li>
            <li>But i contacted the seller and they told me they would replace them for free.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with my Red Angel plates!</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>(you know when you have a huge area and the stamp bottoms out and the stamp ends up splotchy) and one looks too light.</li>
            <li>I was extremely happy with my purchase of the Red Angel Nail Stamping Plates.</li>
            <li>(since I had just did my own nails :P).&lt;br /&gt;I had to work really fast for the image to come out</li>
            <li>but the plates are made of cheap metals</li>
            <li>This is a great collection with lots of different designs.</li>
            <li>so I plan to get lint free cloths to use....</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t have an image plate holder, so i would suggest you do what i do: put the plate over a rag or paper towel, as the edges aren&#x27;t too smooth and can cause you to scratch the surface you have it on.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for such a great product xoxo</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>When I got my 1st set of red angle they stamped great.</li>
            <li>These plates are great, with only one drawback.</li>
            <li>so if they fit so should these</li>
            <li>I have been using my images and have been having fun with them :)  </li>
            <li>Still there are enough great designs in this batch that work to satisfy me.</li>
            <li>All in all, I am happy with the product will definitely order from them again.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to enjoy my plates, You have to try a lot of times to get what You want.</li>
            <li>Takes practice if you have never stamped before but really fun :)</li>
            <li>I thought that this set had the prettiest images of all the the sets available</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever done nail stamping, and these plates turned out pretty good.   </li>
            <li>These two negatives don&#x27;t take away from the review though, because overall they are better than the MASH plates IMO, but even the MASH plates are really good.</li>
            <li>Must make sure the paint you use is good enough.</li>
            <li>The images are clear and a good size.</li>
            <li>Also work very good with other polishes that are not konad.</li>
            <li>I am an experienced stamper, I also used the konad special polish (which gives you more optimal results) but still no success.</li>
            <li>I was instantly excited and had to have them.</li>
            <li>the plates were protected with a blue plastic, thought they were scratched at first, but actually in pretty perfect condition from removable plastic cover.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll post a more thorough review after I use them for the first time.</li>
            <li>I think they are worth it!</li>
            <li>The designs are original...</li>
            <li>, these are great for the price, most of them work if you are fast enough :P.</li>
            <li>and I was overly excited.</li>
            <li>Most of these designs stamp crisply.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bummer, because I was really excited to get this set.</li>
            <li>Seems to that they would would great for some with acrylic or long nails.  </li>
            <li>Fun to use!</li>
            <li>I bought these because I found that I really liked nail stamping, I wanted new designs....</li>
            <li>I have ordered countless bundles of stamping plates and these by far are the best!!</li>
            <li>Changing your nail design is easy and fun.</li>
            <li>This seemed to fit the bill, the reviews were good, and some review videos left me hopeful.</li>
            <li>can be a bit of a pain to clean and sometimes the designs.</li>
            <li>Loving them and hope to see more from Red Angel.</li>
            <li>I have played around with several designs and do far they have all came out perfect.</li>
            <li>While the images aren&#x27;t quite as well etched into the metal as Konad plates are, Red Angel is the best alternative I have found so far.</li>
            <li>The patterns are set pretty deep which is good because you get a better transfer</li>
            <li>I found the stamps very easy to use and a high quality product.</li>
            <li>designs are all the right depth, and so easy to</li>
            <li>After using many other stamping plate products, I believed these plates would be just as good.  </li>
            <li>My new supplies arrived, I tried again and finally got a successful transfer!</li>
            <li>You do not need to buy special stamping polish like some people claim.</li>
            <li>It is ok for my cousin, whose nails are large.  </li>
            <li>well I would suggest using Konad special polish.</li>
            <li>Consider getting the special polish.</li>
            <li>This being my first experience with nail stamping plates, I am very satisfied and encouraged to continue on in my new found hobby of nail art!</li>
            <li>It feature more complex looking designs that stamp beautifully.</li>
            <li>I really like these stamp plates, my clients love the detailed fun</li>
            <li>Having said that I am pretty happy with the purchase overall.  </li>
            <li>RA-109, the two full nail leafy and flower images.</li>
            <li>There are lots of full nail designs.  </li>
            <li>I am a fan of full nail design.  </li>
            <li>There is a good variety of different designs.  </li>
            <li>My plate did not have the cool star pattern that is pictured in the description but instead has animal printy pattern.  </li>
            <li>This really shouldn&#x27;t be something that would stop you from purchasing these lovely plates.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a starter nail stamping kit Red Angel would be a good place to start.</li>
            <li>As with any of the plates, they work best with thick polish.</li>
            <li>Lots of full nail patterns to chose from.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love these nail plate designs, it an absolute must have product.</li>
            <li>They are etched very deeply as well which is good....</li>
            <li>I bought this item based off of a nail tutorial and am beyond pleased with the product and how fast they shipped this.</li>
            <li>Most of the stamps stamp very well.</li>
            <li>so the images can be transfer to the nails, I really expect more of this product because of the reviews.</li>
            <li>The images were nice and clear, I had not problems with these plates.  </li>
            <li>The full nail designs are micro</li>
            <li>I thought the Red Angel Stamps were a good idea.  </li>
            <li>I have placed two orders from PUEEN and overall the plates arrived in good condition.  </li>
            <li>The full nail images are of a good size, comparable with Konad and the second Bundle Monster set.</li>
            <li>The blue protective film was effective and easy to pull off.</li>
            <li>Red Angel was a perfect investment to my image plate collection, and I find that i use them much more than my other plates, if not for anything else, but for thier beauty.</li>
            <li>I mean the images came out perfect when I stamp my nails with it.</li>
            <li>The plates came exactly as shown, and were shipped out very quickly.</li>
            <li>First I would like to start by saying, these came very quickly.</li>
            <li>Overall, both plates are good for the price but definitely go with the red angel plates, I&#x27;m happy I got these!</li>
            <li>son preciosos y estampan super bien.  </li>
            <li>it was sent quick and i received it quick</li>
            <li>I am enjoying playing around with using different color combinations to see what shows up on top of what colors.</li>

            <li>The images were gorgeous and extremely detailed, and they are quite noticeably deeper-set than other brands.</li>
            <li>The shipping was VERY fast!</li>
            <li>Was very pleased when I started to peel the blue covering off.</li>
            <li>All in all, for the price I am VERY pleased with these plates and will order from Red Angel again.</li>
            <li>This item is cheap but it does it job pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I like my new plates much more than the ones in the kit</li>
            <li>I love their new and funky designs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, for the price, there is a good variety of patterns that are unique and not found in other plate systems.</li>

            <li>I recieved exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>I have been doing nail art for many years, but I only recently discovered how amazing nail stamping can be!</li>
            <li>This is a great deal, especially for someone who is new to the nail stamping world.</li>
            <li>One plate was not the right one, but their customer service quickly resolved the matter without any hassle.  </li>
            <li>The square designs appear to cover barely cover my thumb but are perfect for my other fingers.</li>
            <li>Love them so far, easy to use and love so many of the designs.&lt;br /&gt;Noticed though that I got a duplicate of one and was missing</li>
            <li>These plates I scrape with a little more pressure depending on design and press lightly for transfer as they hold more paint</li>
            <li>The designs are different from the others I&#x27;ve seen - more artistic and original.  </li>
            <li>I only found two designs that can be considered as \\&quot;dupes\\&quot;, but aside from that, everything else is amazing.</li>
            <li>2 plates were gouged beyond use but the company replaced them fast &amp; free.</li>
            <li>I received the plates very quickly and the main one that I was wanting was the RA-111 plate with the \\&quot;fish scale\\&quot; design.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m having tons of fun with all the design choices...</li>
            <li>As a first time nail stamp user, I can&#x27;t wait to see how these cool designs work.</li>
            <li>I did when I wrote my first review, so the full designs don&#x27;t cover all my nails.</li>
            <li>I own Bundle Monster, Kaying(faux-nad), and now Red Angel plates.</li>
            <li>I think these would make a nice addition to any collection and lets hope that this manufacture will listen to demands and make plate images BIGGER!</li>
            <li>This is going to be so much fun.  </li>
            <li>Stamps clear images for the most part.  </li>
            <li>the plates just weren&#x27;t clear when stamped, but I&#x27;m pleased with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This collection of plates certainly is not disappointing.  </li>
            <li>but for the price their still worth it</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Its worth the money</li>
            <li>I would even go as far as to say that I like them better than Konad.</li>
            <li>The images on the plates are clear and they are easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Some could be bigger, but for the most part, they fit my nails and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to make my own for this set, but it would definitely improve the plates if they came with it.  </li>
            <li>Overall they are nice......</li>
            <li>Easy to use, high quality plates.  </li>
            <li>They are worth getting and the price is right.</li>
            <li>The images are well defined, and there are many interesting full-nail images that I&#x27;ve never seen in the other brands.</li>
            <li>I really love the unique designs on these Red Angel plates.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>there are lots of images to choose from, and the shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li>These designs are so unique and stamp very well.</li>
            <li>I got exactly what I wanted and the shipping was very fast!</li>
            <li>The image quality is not as good as some other brands</li>
            <li>just right.  </li>
            <li>right.</li>
            <li>For example, the image of the phoenix is facing right.</li>
            <li>I started using them right away.</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>I love my new plates, I have many different designs to choose from.  </li>
            <li>I really love the Red Angel nail stamping plates, they have some really cool designs on them.</li>
            <li>If this is your first set of stamping plates, be sure you also order a stamper and scraper (though an old gift card works just as well)</li>
            <li>awesome images, different designs than just the average butterfly and flowers.</li>
            <li>I get clean lines and the impressions have all been very consistent.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how many different designs, and how many plates I was able to receive for such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money, I know the designs are super cute, but you won&#x27;t be satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>probably less cutesy and more sophisticated than the shany ones.  </li>
            <li>I really like the amount of full nail images in this kit</li>
            <li>The images are awesome &amp; are large enough to cover all fingers including the thumb nail which is an issue with some other brands.</li>
            <li>and I would most definitely put these on you high priority list!!!</li>
            <li>The stamps come out nice and clean and sharp !</li>
            <li>The plates are deep enough to get great prints from them.</li>
            <li>you get so many different ones you will have so much fun with them</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used at least one print off of each plate and so far, they are absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li>Plus i got it super fast ^_^</li>
            <li>There are some cute images, and the full nail images are large enough for my thumb.  </li>
            <li>Overall I think that it is a good deal for image plates, and has very unique designs separate from other image plates from Konad or Bundle Monster.  </li>
            <li>The designs are all unique and fun and original to Red Angel.</li>
            <li>So far everything I have tried to stamp with them, stamps easily and the first time.  </li>
            <li>It shipped very fast and you get a lot of designs for what you&#x27;re paying.</li>
            <li>Sent to me very fast.  </li>
            <li>Stamping plates arrived very fast and all but one, RA110, works.</li>
            <li>The shipment came very fast.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Very, very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>They still did good, I just wish they were a little deeper set</li>
            <li>I am excited to have a new NOTD look every day.</li>
            <li>The designs on these plates are all new and unique.</li>
            <li>so happy that theres people seeling this hard to find product</li>
            <li>6 of my plates are damaged with either pock marks near the designs or huge scratches running through the plates.</li>
            <li>Out of 119 different designs 33 of them come out blurry or do not transfer appropriately.</li>
            <li>and I can use some regular nail polish with them (thicker is better</li>
            <li>I love all of the different designs on the plates.</li>
            <li>This was my first set and now I&#x27;m hooked</li>
            <li>I love my Red Angel nail plates!</li>
            <li>i look forward to more plates in the future</li>
            <li>I cut myself twice while trying to remove the film on the first plate I used with this set.</li>
            <li>I gave four stars because I would really like them to have a backing!</li>
            <li>This was the first set I got after I tried the Salon Express kit.  </li>
            <li>They are pretty affordable.  </li>
            <li>but after getting the red angel plates, I think I will stick with these because they&#x27;re a better price</li>
            <li>The image in the top left corner which looks like snowflakes and Christmas ornaments was not on the plate.</li>
            <li>It looks like the top image on the French plate 101.</li>
            <li>I had much better luck with designs stamping with the entire image fully covered with polish</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a number of heart themed ones as well as a couple that say &#x27;love&#x27; in various pretty ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We are already aware of this situation.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>i love my red angel plates, use them all the time.</li>
            <li>This was my first step of stamping plates</li>
            <li>and I really like them!</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>I love the designs especially the smiley faces.</li>
            <li>People always ask how I&#x27;m able to get such intricate designs myself.</li>
            <li>my darling daughter  loves it so much!</li>
            <li>: cost, designs are cute (especially the smilies)</li>
            <li>;)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>is faulty, so don&#x27;t discard them, but make sure to buy a different stamping pad to go with these plates.</li>
            <li>I couldnt really point out any flaws in these plates!</li>
            <li>i used keankolor, opi, china glaze and the konad specialty polish, which all scraped off pretty well..</li>
            <li>The only issue like many of the customers has is that it doesn&#x27;t have a backing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is my sincere hope that Red Angel has solved this problem, by now.</li>
            <li>;)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Shipping was beyond fast!</li>
            <li>I love the red angel stamping set....</li>
            <li>They need some more hello kitty designs, breast cancer ribbons, an aunk and even a Celtic knot on the next set.</li>
            <li>This is the first collection I purchased after I saw a review on YouTube.</li>
            <li>This is such a deal (or a steal) for the fact that the Konad plates are more pricey just for 1.</li>
            <li>Full size nail stamps didn&#x27;t fit my entire nail.</li>
            <li>Exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>When the plates arrive, and the blue protective plastic is removed, most of the plates arrive damaged.  </li>
            <li>Items showed up in good condition and in just a few days.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for beginners because you have to know a few tricks to get optimum results.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these plates to anyone in love with nail art, even the inexperienced nail-lover will get endless joy out of these.</li>
            <li>Sweet new designs.</li>
            <li>plate with acetone before first use then as needed to keep design clean and concise.</li>
            <li>I like this set, the designs are new &amp; fresh which is exciting because I have a slight obsession with nail stamping &amp; own many sets from different brands.</li>
            <li>Some of the full nail designs are smaller some bigger which can be nice.</li>
            <li>So when I was looking for some new image plates, I needed to spend as little as possible but still get a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Red Angel \\&quot;nailed\\&quot; it!  </li>
            <li>Sure enough, a few days later, they arrived and I am very impressed with the prompt action and courtesy JMGlobal provided.</li>
            <li>I really like how there are so many different designs</li>
            <li>* - Make sure to use nail polishes that are more opaque and thick</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not very good at the stamping yet, but the practicing I did on paper had nice clean lines.</li>
            <li>I am new to nail art stamping and these are the very first set of plates that I bought.</li>
            <li>I found them easy to use, and worked well with ordinary nail polish in many cases.</li>
            <li>Other than that I&#x27;m beyond pleased with the super fast shipping and quality of the plates.</li>
            <li>I was really excited about some of the new designs that this particular brand offered</li>
            <li>I put that kit away and pretty much gave up and put the kit</li>
            <li>I love these stamping plates, I love the designs pretty different from some other brands.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>this is still a great value (even with shipping cost), and i would still recommend it to friends, although i can not express this enough: please take caution with the sharp edges, as it is not an exaggeration.</li>
            <li>My ten year old niece likes the designs, great for tiny nails.</li>
            <li>They were shipped fast and the were exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed, although I will say that the edges of the plates are a little sharp!</li>
            <li>I decided to try out the Red Angel plates for the first time and they have been a HUGE hit.</li>
            <li>If you are super careful, it&#x27;s fine though.</li>
            <li>I have purchased \\&quot;Shany\\&quot; plates as well as many single Konad plates.</li>
            <li>The images on the plates are too large for my nails.</li>
            <li>On using these plates: Let me start of by saying that they certainly did not disappoint.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not an issue, or certainly shouldn&#x27;t be imo.</li>
            <li>Images are large and well-cut.</li>
            <li>The blue plastic was easy to remove much to my delight.    </li>
            <li>If Red Angel wants to send me new some plates with better images, then I&#x27;m all for it.</li>
            <li>I bought the Konad stamper and these stamp plates--lots of different designs to choose from, and they work just fine.  </li>
            <li>Just received my new Red Angel nail stamp plates, and I am very excited to try them out.</li>
            <li>The designs are large and there is no problem covering the whole nail (unlike BM series 1)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>good mix of single, full, tips, and half moon patterns.&lt;br /&gt;High</li>
            <li>I scrape lightly as I want to leave as much polish as possible for the transfer</li>
            <li>Very upset at this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d really like to know though</li>
            <li>So I ordered this after extensive checking to see what was available price versus value</li>
            <li>They all show up really well</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t about to spend so much just for one plate.</li>
            <li>If a second set becomes available I would buy it.</li>
            <li>They came fast and I tried them that night.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any real quality problems.</li>
            <li>These plates work really well.  </li>
            <li>BUT I REALLY DONT LIKE</li>
            <li>YOU REALLY NEED TO PUT BACKING ON THEM</li>
            <li>WOULDN&#x27;T REALLY RECOMMEND THESE</li>
            <li>Second, the shany plates have sticky residue left from the plastic film while the red angel plates have a nice smooth surface.   </li>
            <li>They stamp very well.</li>
            <li>I plan on asking the seller for a replacement because I really wanted that one.</li>
            <li>and they all seemed to transfer really well, so I am updating from 3 stars to 4.</li>
            <li>(Sometimes I apply too much pressure)</li>
            <li>And for $13, can you really think of a reason why not?</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast as well.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot</li>
            <li>Very impressive.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>I really want my money back.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>One had too much etched space and didn&#x27;t stamp well</li>
            <li>One plate come  very damage</li>
            <li>that did not work at all no matter how fast I worked, it was the image of the girl.&lt;br</li>
            <li>how fast you have to be.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t use konad polishes) pick up really well, and for $15 it really can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>These images transfer very well.</li>
            <li>and i really do like the images.</li>
            <li>The seller was very accomadating.</li>
            <li>I cleaned them up well, but it didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li>I really recommend these.</li>
            <li>i really like the selection that these plates offer.</li>
            <li>I got the item and it was more than I expected.</li>
            <li>It was at a reasonable price for this type of product.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, many of the images had missing areas when transferred.</li>
            <li>Kind of disappointing, but overall the plates are still a great value.</li>
            <li>I look forward to trying some of the designs very soon.</li>
            <li>Had a lil delay because of post office loosing package but seller was very helpful and send out a replacement.</li>
            <li>I really wanted these sets ..</li>
            <li>Highly recommend you try these plates!</li>
            <li>I am still getting use to the whole stamping process</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t listen to all the negative reviews this is a good way to get started.</li>
            <li>My 9 year old put a nice slice in her hand when she was using these and it bled like crazy and gave me a good scare.  </li>
            <li>They come nicely packaged in a heavy plastic storage pouch.</li>
            <li>(i have natural short nails), it would come out more like lines and geometric designs instead of an image or background.</li>
            <li>The number of image plates that&#x27;s sold as a set are a dynamic deal and very economically priced.  </li>
            <li>and I like how different they are from most of the other sets available.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice if i can have the phoenix facing right for one hand and the other hand have it facing left.</li>
            <li>The full nail designs are large enough to go way over my thumbs.</li>
            <li>They have so many designs you won&#x27;t find on other brand&#x27;s plates.</li>
            <li>They are etched deep enough to get a rich colorful print!</li>
            <li>I was excited to get my Red Angle Nail Art plates</li>
            <li>The tip designs don&#x27;t fit on my thumbs, but I must have larger thumb nails than most average women.  </li>
            <li>Most of these designs are dupes of other brands.  </li>
            <li>i have konad, bundle monster and some other one, and i really am glad i bought this one.  </li>
            <li>but I have other stamps that I love.</li>
            <li>I love the images, they are very wide in range of topics.</li>
            <li>the designs are new and innovative not the same old thing you see all the time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to pay a few more bucks for that.</li>
            <li>Also, because they are etched deeply, they are a pain to clean with cotton or q-tips, or anything that leaves lint or can snag...because it will...</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I got my new red angel plates, I tried them out right away and after much trial and error finally got it right.</li>
            <li>Very original designs on those plates, no exact dupes of Konad or bundle monster plates....</li>
            <li>Not all the plates work very well, they are not deep enough, so the stamping is very light.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for other nail stamping junkies like me. :-)</li>
            <li>The deep etching allows for time for placement [not as much problem with polish drying on stamp] and a bold imprint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The images stamp crisp and clear with both regular and special Konad stamping polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>all the images transferred crisp and clear.</li>
            <li>full nail designs are larger which works well longer nails.</li>
            <li>I just wish they had backing and that the full images and French tips were a bit wider.</li>
            <li>These Angel full stamp images are same size as a konad image.</li>
            <li>ohh and some of the dessigns are kind of too small for my nail.</li>
            <li>The full nail designs need to be BIGGER.</li>
            <li>I thought that the deeper-set images would give and advantage when transferring, but in practicality, that means more polish, which means it doesnt dry as fast(could be a good thing or bad) and the volume of polish transferred made it easy for me to smudge the design.</li>
            <li>Nice designs, they look pretty shallow</li>
            <li>I have tried every single design as soon as I got in the mail (which by the way was SUPER fast) and they all stamp on with no problem!</li>
            <li>I hope they keep coming out with new ones!</li>
            <li>None of full nails images pick up the full design, and even if that wasn&#x27;t a problem, the full nail images are too narrow to cover the entire width of all the nails.</li>
            <li>First of all the shany nail plates have a blue plastic film which is impossible to take off, the red angels come off so easily, I was impressed.  </li>
            <li>This was an international order, so I ended up paying more money for the post rather than for the actual item...</li>
            <li>The full designs fit my nails well, although my nails are quite small.  </li>
            <li>Images are the same size as the Konads, but they are more deeply and intracately engraved.  </li>
            <li>Go find a dude with decent sized nails and throw some patterns in that would cover HIS nails.</li>
            <li>but the designs are etched deep enough on most plates</li>
            <li>will definitely order red angel nail plates again. :)</li>
            <li>Love the designs - all totally different from 1st &amp; 2nd Bundle Monster sets.</li>
            <li>I am currently making it my mission to purchase as many nail stamping sets as possible!  </li>
            <li>This set is very good works just as well (if not better) as the more expensive plates.</li>
            <li>Some of the images are hard to clean because the lines are so fine like the heart and line tip on plate</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these for their price and uniqueness.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these for their price and uniqueness.</li>
            <li>, spend your money on those brands, if don&#x27;t want to pay the high price for Konad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I wish they had the backing like some of the others do, but if you handle them carefully you&#x27;ll be fine.  </li>
            <li>Different images from the other popular brands.  </li>
            <li>I love the little package they come in.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s a little blood for cute nails though?  </li>
            <li>sharp edges are true!  </li>
            <li>Now my only problem is deciding which one to use first!  </li>
            <li>One of the plates came HIGHLY damaged with a huge gauge of a scratch right down the middle, and another was lightly scratched several times like something had scraped it.</li>
            <li>plates are easy to handle and there wasn&#x27;t any sharp edges since there are paper backing for each of the plates.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, the edges are extremely uneven and will cause many little cuts on your fingers, as many others have mentioned in their reviews.</li>
            <li>The full nail designs are large enough to cover my whole nail, but just not the nail on my big toe.</li>
            <li>I did find out that if the polish is too thin, then the color would not be bright as it should be</li>
            <li>Love the little plastic storage case, it&#x27;s a little flimsy, but has stood up to the sharp edged plates so far, and it&#x27;s great to have something provided to store/organize the plates in.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They have fresh designs and are etched deeply.</li>
            <li>and I press more firmly to transfer.</li>
            <li>If I have one complaint one lace design would have been nice.  </li>
            <li>this is not worth the money I spent on them which is a shame because they do have some good looking designs.</li>
            <li>There were some complaints about not having a backing and that the edges were sharp but if you don&#x27;t handle them recklessly then you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>These came nicely packaged in a little soft plastic envelope and while I haven&#x27;t tried all the plates yet, the few designs I tested worked just fine.</li>
            <li>Also, the whole nail images are larger than most of the other knock off brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The designs are really different for example the snowflake is more detailed than other dupe brands, I  even think a lot of them are even cooler looking than the real Konad ones, and they seem nicer than other dupe brands.</li>
            <li>The designs are very pretty; the full nail designs do seem a bit small but workable.</li>
            <li>a set of 21 pieces,some designs are large enough to cover the whole nail.all</li>
            <li>I have konad and bundle monster plates and these are mostly new designs not offered by either konad or bundle monster.  </li>
            <li>They have a lot of new designs that I have not seen before.</li>
            <li>I am new to nail stamping and purchased these plates to begin my collection.</li>
            <li>you are new to nail stamping then</li>
            <li>I am new at nail stamping.  </li>
            <li>As many people have already said, they don&#x27;t have paper backing, but I haven&#x27;t experienced any problems cutting or even scratching myself, so don&#x27;t consider this a down side.   </li>
            <li>It was too late for me but good for everyone in the future.</li>
            <li>a few konads and both Bundle Monster sets, and the Red Angel plates had a lot of unique designs (and lots of full nail designs that i prefer).</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at how well these were etched.  </li>
            <li>Plates look very professional and durable</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried each one and they all stamp extremely well...!!! :)</li>
            <li>Some finer images like the butterfly on RA-119 are hard to work more than once since it is really hard to clean the tiny engravings (and it just won&#x27;t stamp unless very clean).</li>
            <li>Since the seller provided larger image views of the plates on the website, I was excited to see such a different variety of images.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaged neatly and Shipped fast!  </li>
            <li>These plates do not stamp QUITE as crisp as Konad but one can only tell under close scrutiny that their crispness is not up to Konad standards.</li>
            <li>So far I am very satisfied with this purchase, and I am sure I won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li>I was also excited for plate RA-118 because of the snowflake for the same reason, however, there was not a snowflake on my plate and instead was just a generic looking flower.</li>
            <li>The image on my RA-107 plate in the bottom left corner was an amoeba looking stamp, similar to the stamp on RA-113 top left.  </li>
            <li>When I use my Konad plates I usually have time to double check the image and make sure I position it on the nail exactly where I want it.</li>
            <li>designs are so cute and a lot different from other plates we can find everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Too</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>but overall these are very well made!</li>
            <li>first off, i ordered mine on November 20th and received it November 23rd....</li>
            <li>Their ok and do their job, the only thing is they rally sharp and need be handle</li>
            <li>These plates have so many different images not repeated ones like the other plates.</li>
            <li>Unfourtnately several images don&#x27;t stamp well at all, it seems the etching isn&#x27;t consistent and the images won&#x27;t transfer.</li>
            <li>I have not stamped with these yet but just from what I have seen on blogs and from my inspection of the plates they all look to be cleanly engraved and deep enough that the polish wont scrap out.  </li>
            <li>other stamping designs look pretty big too compared to designs from other kind of plates i got.</li>
            <li>The designs are super cute, but the edges of the round disks are razor sharp!  </li>
            <li>I even wasted too much money on \\&quot;special nail polish.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>But again it was a true bargain as I&#x27;ve only paid 20 Euro in total.</li>
            <li>The full nail images cover all but my thumb nail completely and I have wide nail beds.</li>
            <li>Another reviewer called them whimsical, I believe, and that&#x27;s pretty apt.  </li>
            <li>AND The first set of plates (MASH) that I bought, had small full nail designs.</li>
            <li>The company was nice enough to plate them, but those replacements were not much better.</li>
            <li>Also they arrived quickly considering that I live on the other end of the planet (it took 2 weeks).   </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to get used to using these if you have never used them before, you have to be quick before the polish dries though, but they are fun to play with.</li>
            <li>It can be fixed, you can get crafty and take half of the butterfly wings, but that&#x27;s not the point.  </li>
            <li>The designs are large enough for my nails.  </li>
            <li>I will certainly purchase items from them in the future!</li>
            <li>not just copies of other plates (which is why I bought them even though I have more plates than I could possibly need :O) )</li>
            <li>I have bought a few different sets of these from different companies and I would def rate these among the top 3!</li>
            <li>Images are clear.</li>
            <li>They should really add them back.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just waiting for someone too do a complete holiday collection because I don&#x27;t want to buy each one separately.</li>
            <li>I have used three images so far and have found that one of them doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>The designs are like none that I have seen so far that is one of the factors that led me to have my husband purchase the set for me.</li>
            <li>some of the whole nail designs are smaller they do cover the majority of the fingernails.</li>
            <li>You will straight slice yourself open on these.</li>
            <li>the very first thing i noticed was the sharp edges.</li>
            <li>I only had to send an email and they responded really fast.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t pick up the polish well, nor transfer it to the nail completely.</li>
            <li>For the one or two designs I enjoy using the rest of the product is a waste.</li>
            <li>So far, I have tried about six plates and</li>
            <li>/&gt;However Konad plates are $5-6 each, while Red Angel plates were @$15 for 21 plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to value per dollar spent, I don&#x27;t think you can come up with a better buy than Red Angel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional nail tech and use them all the time.  </li>
            <li>The images are clean and sharp, the stamps are big enough even for thumb nails and they shipped fast!  </li>
            <li>So, although there are still quite a few designs I cannot use, I am overall happy with the ones I can use, I am only sad that I am not able to use all of the great new designs.</li>
            <li>They arrived very quickly and I haven&#x27;t put them down!!</li>
            <li>I tried the plate right after I received, and I did not really like them.</li>
            <li>Every other plate company I have ordered from (Mash, Bundle Monster, and a generic plate company) have always been completely accurate with the pictures and descriptions.   </li>
            <li>the only thing that i believe is important to say is that they are too sharp..</li>
            <li>While this is less than a 30% failure rate, the majority of them are the full nail designs, which are my favorite ones to use.</li>
            <li>I have had success with other plates.  </li>
            <li>but if I had to pick which nail plates were better, I would definitely pick red angel plates, HANDS DOWN.  </li>
            <li>The designs are too shallow, so whenever I scrape off the excess polish, there goes most of the design, too.</li>
            <li>better then before they are still ridiculously</li>
            <li>so i&#x27;ve had this set for some time and the only images I use any more are the small ones.</li>
            <li>I have many other plates from other manufacturers that do not have backing, however, I cut my finger on one when I was removing the protective film.</li>
            <li>Being my first time, I obviously need to get the hang of it and practice a bit, but that&#x27;s the same with all nail stamping plates.  </li>
            <li>I purchased these back in December and used them for the first and last time in February.</li>
            <li>I would like to see some plates with only one design on it, but with different sizes of that same design to fit onto different size nails</li>
            <li>Highly recommended, would definitely buy from again!  </li>
            <li>I actually like these Red Angel ones better because they are a little deeper</li>
            <li>I have only had a problem stamping with a few of them, but when I try different polishes they do seem to do better.</li>
            <li>However, with this kit, I have had minimal problems with getting images to stamp and the images come out crisp.</li>
            <li>Thankfully they were almost exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another thing is that these images are kind of small , the full plate ones are slightly less than half an inch</li>
            <li>I felt like these plates had the designs I was looking for and other than being VERY sharp, as I&#x27;ve read most plates</li>
            <li>Not a single complain here!!!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait for the next new idea from them.</li>
            <li>next, as i looked at the images, i saw lots of new designs that i haven&#x27;t seen before.</li>
            <li>Even though these are so cheap compared to the Konad plates, they are a total waste of money.</li>
            <li>My only issue with these plates is the same as the original BM Plates, the sharp edges.</li>
            <li>RED ANGEL HAS FIXED THIS PROBLEM AND EACH PLATE COMES WITH A BACKING!</li>
            <li>Love these only a few designs are not deep enough.  </li>
            <li>so given that twelve out of the twenty plates are full nail designs and the one tip plate is also too small, I don&#x27;t get much use out of them.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t discourage anybody from buying them because I still think they have some of the prettiest images so if you have smaller hands and the patience to keep stamping the same image over and over, go for it.</li>
            <li>the images are cut too deep a lot of the images get smeared and they snag when u try to clean them so little hairs always get stuck, my fairy images have no wings so they look like strippers.</li>
            <li>I gave it two stars because at least some of the plates were fine, but the majority of them were warped plates.</li>
            <li>However apparently my nails must be considered Very Long and wide as the only fingers the images fit are my ring and pinkie</li>
            <li>On a couple of the plates there are deep scratches, but only 2 designs are affected, and I didn&#x27;t care for those particular ones anyway.</li>
            <li>When I try to use any of the images on these 7 plates, due to the deep etching too much polish is left after scraping and then too much polish is picked up on the stamper.  </li>
            <li>I wish the full nail images were a little larger.</li>
            <li>I bought these based on the other positive feedback I&#x27;d read</li>
            <li>like these in general.</li>
            <li>Crisp, clear stamps, with a few exceptions.</li>
            <li>No regrets buying this product what so ever.</li>
            <li>Pick yourself up a Konad double sided stamper and use an old gift card/credit card as a scraper, the metal edged scrapers WILL scratch the plates (found this out for myself).</li>
            <li>I used the plates, and they have no problem with complete coverage and picking up the entire design.</li>
            <li>fast shipping, just what i expected.</li>
            <li>are ( I just cut up some old cereal boxes and glued them to the back of the plates to prevent injury),  </li>
            <li>I have lost count of how many of these I have, I&#x27;m just addicted to all Nail Plates and polishes.</li>
            <li>This makes it kind of difficult to use consecutively.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We will implement paper back for our next new batch.</li>
            <li>and my customers keep coming back because I very regularly invest in new designs for them.</li>
            <li>Any other brand I can use the same nail polish on, but only one of my polishes will transfer over from these plates with any success.</li>
            <li>It did seem some were more shallow than others when I was stamping different ones all w/the same polish.&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful</li>
            <li>Because i red the reviews before purchasing, i was aware of the sharp edges</li>
            <li>Some of the full nail sized images are too shallow to pick up will and transfer completely across the nail-</li>
            <li>I fund this plate set a bit hard to clean then my others.</li>
            <li>The other plates work very well</li>
            <li>but they are so hard to clean</li>
            <li>Other than that, I really like it</li>
            <li>Not the best but far from the worst.</li>
            <li>but once you take your stamper to get the image, the color splatters out because the images were cut so deep, that when you try to transfer it, the entire image is blotted and completely distorted.</li>
            <li>only problem was that the full nail images were a bit on the small side.</li>
            <li>In all fairness I didn&#x27;t use it with special polish, just regular polish and I was mostly scraping with an old card because the metal scraper I have scrapes my plates which is annoying.</li>
            <li>If I had no other choice I would have kept these, but I am still looking for a bulk order that actually works the way it should.</li>
            <li>If I was to slow it would only transfer half the image and the other half was dried on my stamp, but if I was really fast it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>I used several different brands of nail polish and the engravings are deep so that a clear image is achieved regardless of the nail polish I used.</li>
            <li>so I got a set, I have only used a few designs, but I really like these plates so far.</li>
            <li>They have no backing to them like bundle monster or konad and they can cut you if you&#x27;re not careful pulling the blue plastic off before using.  </li>
            <li>At first I had a duplicate of #19 and missing #5.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used all of the images on the Red Angel plates, but the ones I&#x27;ve used stamped just as well as the far more expensive Konad plates.</li>
            <li>It has just the right amount of full-nail designs with a bit of small designs as well.</li>
            <li>but when I tried the stamp it only really made an impact on my thumb, which I find is typical for stamping plates</li>
            <li>They came in a little plastic pouch that can be used for storage and had the proper backing, even the blue plastic came of without much fuss.</li>

            <li> So many great designs on these plates, and a great price for how many designs you get.  </li>
            <li> I got this product for my girlfriend who does her own nails, she loved it..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having read the reviews about the edges, right out of the box I took a nail file and dulled the edges as best</li>
            <li> The plates are of the best quality, the prints are deep and catch the polish well, equaling very good transfer to a stamper and then to your nail.</li>
            <li> I love them and would recommend these to everyone!</li>
            <li> Love these plates!</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t wait for more designs to come out!</li>

            <li> the images transfer nicely.</li>
            <li> Patterns are so nice</li>
            <li> so it will take some practice to get good, but I enjoy playing around with it!</li>
            <li> I own konad, both bundle monster sets, Chez Delaney,  and Mash.</li>
            <li> And the designs are not rehashed Konad designs, which is nice.</li>
            <li> I had a wonderful ordering experience and the plates arrived in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> I ordered these just because I liked some of the patterns, but did not expect them to work well.</li>
            <li> Nice assortment of images</li>
            <li> , they need some kind of backing on them...</li>
            <li> They also come with their own storage pouch.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to get these plates because the full nail images are so beautiful.</li>
            <li> There are plenty of nice designs to chose from.</li>
            <li> I am a nail tech and own my own salon</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and responses, impressive customer service.  </li>

            <li> Of the ones that are etched OK I can easily make beautiful designs.  </li>
            <li> The images come out very clean and look good on my nails.  </li>
            <li> The images on the plates are unique, and for $16 including shipping is a great deal for 21 plates.</li>

            <li> This set is a perfect starter set for someone who isn&#x27;t sure if they want to invest in the larger Bundle Monster or Konad sets, and will give you the practice you need to get good at nail stamping without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> Great buy and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> The good thing is that I just bought contact paper and stuck it to the back, works perfectly!! :)</li>
            <li> These stamped okay and had nice designs.</li>
            <li> Keep an eye out for free shipping on these plates, it seems to come and go, but it&#x27;s a particularly great deal if they&#x27;re offering free shipping.</li>
            <li> I am a COMPLETE Nail junky and Soon to be nail tech :) For the price and quantity... its a great buy!</li>
            <li> I am also VERY pleased with how quickly they came in the mail!</li>
            <li> Of course there are designs I will never use on my own nails, but I think I will eventually use most of the designs, which makes me believe this was a worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li> There is a bow on one of the plates that has been a huge hit and it has a very dainty lace design on it and that comes off the plate and onto the nail very</li>
            <li> They are great quality for a very reasonable price.</li>

            <li> Brought these plates for my first try with nail art stamping and they were great.</li>
            <li> They are a great set to start with if you are interested in stamping &amp; are not too picky about your nails.</li>
            <li> These are very cheap compared to the Konad stamps.  </li>
            <li> and I absolutely love the designs on the plates, the designs pick up easy on your stamper with any kind of polish.</li>
            <li> but the images are beautiful and I can&#x27;t wait for new ones from this company!</li>
            <li> When I viewed the images of the plates I became ecstatic because there are so many great new designs!!</li>
            <li> I too love this set, the designs are Awesome, New and fresh!</li>
            <li> The nail plates were great quality (better than some I have bought), arrived quick, just as described and had unique designs.</li>
            <li> Like most plates, some images you have to scrape/fiddle with</li>
            <li> Awesome product, definitely would recommend.</li>

            <li> I receive many compliments my nails</li>

            <li> I love the nail stamping plates, so when I saw this set</li>
            <li> The plates I had the most problems with are the RA-107, RA-108, RA-112, and</li>
            <li> There are some incredibly cute designs.</li>
            <li> Although the emoticons are kinda cute</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite pleased and hope they come out with another set.</li>
            <li> The majority of the patterns aren&#x27;t dupes of Konad or Bundle Monster, which is refreshing.</li>

            <li> pleased with amount of all over nail designs.</li>

            <li> what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> do like the designs more on these as well.</li>
            <li> WOULD NOT MIND PAYING A COUPLE OF BUCKS MORE TO ENSURE</li>
            <li> The designs are great &amp; they work very well</li>
            <li> I will try to update after using the product more.  </li>
            <li> Konad, Mash, Salon Express.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I have gotten better, but some of these plates are not etched</li>
            <li> All of the images look awesome and feel like they are deeply engraved.  </li>
            <li> but I feel ok about purchase based on price paid for the amount of plates.</li>
            <li> I hope that the more I use the plates the happier</li>
            <li> I would do business with seller again, but would probably ask for better pictures of product I&#x27;m buying before making my purchase.</li>
            <li> These plate images were fantastic for the price!  </li>
            <li> and i love them.</li>
            <li> you will love them.</li>
            <li> The designs are creative and have lots of variety.</li>
            <li> If all of the plates worked, this would be my favorite image plate set.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When they arrived I fell in love with all the images.</li>
            <li> The price was fantastic for the number of plates I received!</li>
            <li> I am impressed with the overall function and value.</li>
            <li> I love these</li>
            <li> and I must say that they are better than the Konad stamping plates.</li>
            <li> so I put my own backing on them to make them more comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> I really love these plates.</li>
            <li> Most people are.</li>
            <li> :) Just increase them.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> There are so many interesting designs to choose from</li>
            <li> Also, personally, I don&#x27;t have many polishes that are best for stamping.  </li>
            <li> The two floral patterns on RA-109 are my favorite.</li>
            <li> I am working on my Konad collection, but wanted something to hold me over until I get more Konad plates.</li>
            <li> used all Konad polishes, and the images came out ok.</li>
            <li> I love the designs but some of them don&#x27;t come transfer to the rubber applicator.  </li>
            <li> The plates may have worked better with the konad polish or a polish meant for stamping.</li>
            <li> so you could pick up more polish.</li>
            <li> I love these plates and the images.</li>
            <li> love the RA plates</li>
            <li> I love all of the designs, but my favorite it the ones with the bubbles</li>
            <li> :) I have the konad stamper and some konad plates</li>
            <li> so you have to make sure you scrape well</li>
            <li> This set is one of my favorite image plates.</li>
            <li> I think the images at etched deeper into the metal, so the pattern picks up better.</li>
            <li> I received these for Valentine&#x27;s Day from my Husband and I truly Love them...</li>
            <li> and I Love the designs...</li>
            <li> I love them.  </li>
            <li> So much better than Cheeky .</li>
            <li> To compare to some of the better brands this one is ok.</li>

            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I need more fingers.  :-)</li>
            <li> Love the plates............</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> I am looking for to more image plates to come out.  </li>
            <li> When these plates arrived I fell in love with the images.</li>
            <li> Red Angel PLEASE MAKE ANOTHER SET SOON!!!!! :D</li>
            <li> All the stamps are really cute.</li>
            <li> Some of the plates work great, others don&#x27;t seem to transfer very well or at all.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, they are just alright.</li>
            <li> Love the quantity and quality.</li>
            <li> Most that I used worked ..</li>
            <li> but I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re simply stunning..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am very happy and will order more Red Angel plates!</li>
            <li> I love this set and it does its job.</li>
            <li> I have watched many YouTube Videos and have gone to lots of websites to get hints, tricks, and how-tos.  </li>
            <li> Love the designs.</li>
            <li> The designs are great, but I don&#x27;t like spending that much time redoing a nail over and over trying to get it to apply.</li>
            <li> To my pleasant surprise, most of the images are deeply etched, transfer well, and are a nice size!</li>
            <li> the stencil covers the whole nail, a very nice size.</li>
            <li> It was very nice and very neatly packaged.</li>
            <li> Because of the low price I thought I&#x27;d give it a try, and I&#x27;m glad I did!!!   </li>
            <li> Happy to have some new designs!</li>
            <li> These plates are super cute and the designs are very unique!</li>
            <li> My first attempt was pretty successful and am looking forward to using them on my daughters too!</li>
            <li> The designs are fun and new with excellent variety-</li>
            <li> The quality of these plates is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> These are a great value for those who are new to nail stamping like me.</li>
            <li> The price was great and the images are fun, fun, fun!!  </li>
            <li> I strongly reccomend this seller and product :)</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t spent a lot of time using the plates, but after searching the many options out there these nail plates had the best combination of designs.</li>
            <li> Great quality, great stamping, but designs are almost same size as Konad, very small for my nails, but it does have a great variety of designs, even a weed leaf hahaha&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> Overall, these are very good plates.</li>
            <li> I use them on top of a napkin and that keeps the free edges from being an issue.</li>
            <li> WOW, these are great quality.</li>
            <li> After more than a few hours of trying to get it to work, the best I was able to come up with is some inconsistent transfers.  </li>
            <li> The one&#x27;s that I have used so far work great.  </li>
            <li> All in all, the set has a good variety of images, but since I didn&#x27;t get what I was really hoping for</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are few flowery designs which are great and a large diamond (harlequin) style design which is good because that was always a design i loved on the BM Plate</li>
            <li> the images are clear and the fine detail is great.</li>
            <li> This plates are so cool!</li>
            <li> On first impression: As soon as I opened these plates I was in love!</li>
            <li> other that that they are great.!!</li>
            <li> In all other ways, the quality and value are superb.</li>
            <li> Reasonable postage and thrilled that I was able to have them posted to NZ, and they arrived within a week of ordering.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re so easy to use.</li>
            <li> These plates arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li> great seller on amazon, would definitely go back and order more.</li>
            <li> The plates are sturdy and easy to use.</li>
            <li> If you have a wide selection of colors that are stampable, then this set is fantastic; it still is wonderful without.  </li>
            <li> I hope that with more experience I can get better images, but right now I don&#x27;t know if it is me or the product.  </li>
            <li> The designs are etched deep and the images come out beautifully.</li>
            <li> They are etched deeply for each design and stamp beautifully.  </li>
            <li> I can never cover a full thumb with most of the etched designs...</li>
            <li> I bought this one because it had more full nail designs than the others.</li>
            <li> ;( I&#x27;m still keeping the set as there are lots on non full nail images that are adorable</li>
            <li> I love this set, the plates are great, new designs that are fresh and fun!</li>
            <li> The price was fair and they arrived quickly and that is all I can say that is positive.</li>
            <li> They are just fine</li>
            <li> but otherwise super cute images.</li>
            <li> metal of the plates feel of cheap, lower quality but it hasn&#x27;t effected the stamping process, they just don&#x27;t seem as strong as the BM or Konad plates</li>
            <li> These came in the mail quickly!</li>
            <li> The designs seem to be more defined and it makes for very pretty nails.</li>
            <li> So far all the designs I&#x27;ve used have stamped cleanly, and they have great original designs.  </li>
            <li> and I major issues with getting the image to transfer successfully.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting something cheap</li>
            <li> All the plates are one of a kind, no repeats, and stamp real well too.</li>
            <li> The Red Angel Plates that I purchased from this seller stamp great.  </li>
            <li> Some of the patterned designs aren&#x27;t fully stamped out but overall great product</li>
            <li> I added paper backing to the plates to fit my preference.</li>
            <li> , I enjoy them.</li>
            <li> The Red Angel ones are great.  </li>
            <li> But i contacted the seller and they told me they would replace them for free.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with my Red Angel plates!</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> (you know when you have a huge area and the stamp bottoms out and the stamp ends up splotchy) and one looks too light.</li>
            <li> I was extremely happy with my purchase of the Red Angel Nail Stamping Plates.</li>
            <li> (since I had just did my own nails :P).&lt;br /&gt;I had to work really fast for the image to come out</li>
            <li> but the plates are made of cheap metals</li>
            <li> This is a great collection with lots of different designs.</li>
            <li> so I plan to get lint free cloths to use....</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t have an image plate holder, so i would suggest you do what i do: put the plate over a rag or paper towel, as the edges aren&#x27;t too smooth and can cause you to scratch the surface you have it on.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for such a great product xoxo</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> When I got my 1st set of red angle they stamped great.</li>
            <li> These plates are great, with only one drawback.</li>
            <li> so if they fit so should these</li>
            <li> I have been using my images and have been having fun with them :)  </li>
            <li> Still there are enough great designs in this batch that work to satisfy me.</li>
            <li> All in all, I am happy with the product will definitely order from them again.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to enjoy my plates, You have to try a lot of times to get what You want.</li>
            <li> Takes practice if you have never stamped before but really fun :)</li>
            <li> I thought that this set had the prettiest images of all the the sets available</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever done nail stamping, and these plates turned out pretty good.   </li>
            <li> These two negatives don&#x27;t take away from the review though, because overall they are better than the MASH plates IMO, but even the MASH plates are really good.</li>
            <li> Must make sure the paint you use is good enough.</li>
            <li> The images are clear and a good size.</li>
            <li> Also work very good with other polishes that are not konad.</li>
            <li> I am an experienced stamper, I also used the konad special polish (which gives you more optimal results) but still no success.</li>
            <li> I was instantly excited and had to have them.</li>
            <li> the plates were protected with a blue plastic, thought they were scratched at first, but actually in pretty perfect condition from removable plastic cover.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll post a more thorough review after I use them for the first time.</li>
            <li> I think they are worth it!</li>
            <li> The designs are original...</li>
            <li> , these are great for the price, most of them work if you are fast enough :P.</li>
            <li> and I was overly excited.</li>
            <li> Most of these designs stamp crisply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bummer, because I was really excited to get this set.</li>
            <li> Seems to that they would would great for some with acrylic or long nails.  </li>
            <li> Fun to use!</li>
            <li> I bought these because I found that I really liked nail stamping, I wanted new designs....</li>
            <li> I have ordered countless bundles of stamping plates and these by far are the best!!</li>
            <li> Changing your nail design is easy and fun.</li>
            <li> This seemed to fit the bill, the reviews were good, and some review videos left me hopeful.</li>
            <li> can be a bit of a pain to clean and sometimes the designs.</li>
            <li> Loving them and hope to see more from Red Angel.</li>
            <li> I have played around with several designs and do far they have all came out perfect.</li>
            <li> While the images aren&#x27;t quite as well etched into the metal as Konad plates are, Red Angel is the best alternative I have found so far.</li>
            <li> The patterns are set pretty deep which is good because you get a better transfer</li>
            <li> I found the stamps very easy to use and a high quality product.</li>
            <li> designs are all the right depth, and so easy to</li>
            <li> After using many other stamping plate products, I believed these plates would be just as good.  </li>
            <li> My new supplies arrived, I tried again and finally got a successful transfer!</li>
            <li> You do not need to buy special stamping polish like some people claim.</li>
            <li> It is ok for my cousin, whose nails are large.  </li>
            <li> well I would suggest using Konad special polish.</li>
            <li> Consider getting the special polish.</li>
            <li> This being my first experience with nail stamping plates, I am very satisfied and encouraged to continue on in my new found hobby of nail art!</li>
            <li> It feature more complex looking designs that stamp beautifully.</li>
            <li> I really like these stamp plates, my clients love the detailed fun</li>
            <li> Having said that I am pretty happy with the purchase overall.  </li>
            <li> RA-109, the two full nail leafy and flower images.</li>
            <li> There are lots of full nail designs.  </li>
            <li> I am a fan of full nail design.  </li>
            <li> There is a good variety of different designs.  </li>
            <li> My plate did not have the cool star pattern that is pictured in the description but instead has animal printy pattern.  </li>
            <li> This really shouldn&#x27;t be something that would stop you from purchasing these lovely plates.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a starter nail stamping kit Red Angel would be a good place to start.</li>
            <li> As with any of the plates, they work best with thick polish.</li>
            <li> Lots of full nail patterns to chose from.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love these nail plate designs, it an absolute must have product.</li>
            <li> They are etched very deeply as well which is good....</li>
            <li> I bought this item based off of a nail tutorial and am beyond pleased with the product and how fast they shipped this.</li>
            <li> Most of the stamps stamp very well.</li>
            <li> so the images can be transfer to the nails, I really expect more of this product because of the reviews.</li>
            <li> The images were nice and clear, I had not problems with these plates.  </li>
            <li> The full nail designs are micro</li>
            <li> I thought the Red Angel Stamps were a good idea.  </li>
            <li> I have placed two orders from PUEEN and overall the plates arrived in good condition.  </li>
            <li> The full nail images are of a good size, comparable with Konad and the second Bundle Monster set.</li>
            <li> The blue protective film was effective and easy to pull off.</li>
            <li> Red Angel was a perfect investment to my image plate collection, and I find that i use them much more than my other plates, if not for anything else, but for thier beauty.</li>
            <li> I mean the images came out perfect when I stamp my nails with it.</li>
            <li> The plates came exactly as shown, and were shipped out very quickly.</li>
            <li> First I would like to start by saying, these came very quickly.</li>
            <li> Overall, both plates are good for the price but definitely go with the red angel plates, I&#x27;m happy I got these!</li>
            <li> son preciosos y estampan super bien.  </li>
            <li> it was sent quick and i received it quick</li>
            <li> I am enjoying playing around with using different color combinations to see what shows up on top of what colors.</li>
            <li> so I contacted the seller and they sent me a replacement almost as quickly.</li>
            <li> All the plates worked very well stamps clean &amp; easy.</li>
            <li> They came with so many different designs and all seem very unique.</li>
            <li> The images were gorgeous and extremely detailed, and they are quite noticeably deeper-set than other brands.</li>
            <li> The shipping was VERY fast!</li>
            <li> Was very pleased when I started to peel the blue covering off.</li>
            <li> All in all, for the price I am VERY pleased with these plates and will order from Red Angel again.</li>
            <li> This item is cheap but it does it job pretty well.  </li>
            <li> I like my new plates much more than the ones in the kit</li>
            <li> I love their new and funky designs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, for the price, there is a good variety of patterns that are unique and not found in other plate systems.</li>
            <li> she said its was easy to use and she has saved so much time and money by not having to go to the nail salon.</li>
            <li> The price on these plates is great, and there is a lovely assortment of full nail images and some smaller single images to play with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely going to buy more!</li>
            <li> The images on all of the plates are crisp and unique.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s exactly what i was looking for!</li>
            <li> i would definitely recommend this product if you love stamping!</li>
            <li> Definitely looking forward to ordering more!</li>
            <li> I recieved exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I have been doing nail art for many years, but I only recently discovered how amazing nail stamping can be!</li>
            <li> This is a great deal, especially for someone who is new to the nail stamping world.</li>
            <li> One plate was not the right one, but their customer service quickly resolved the matter without any hassle.  </li>
            <li> The square designs appear to cover barely cover my thumb but are perfect for my other fingers.</li>
            <li> Love them so far, easy to use and love so many of the designs.&lt;br /&gt;Noticed though that I got a duplicate of one and was missing</li>
            <li> These plates I scrape with a little more pressure depending on design and press lightly for transfer as they hold more paint</li>
            <li> The designs are different from the others I&#x27;ve seen - more artistic and original.  </li>
            <li> I only found two designs that can be considered as \\&quot;dupes\\&quot;, but aside from that, everything else is amazing.</li>
            <li> 2 plates were gouged beyond use but the company replaced them fast &amp; free.</li>
            <li> I received the plates very quickly and the main one that I was wanting was the RA-111 plate with the \\&quot;fish scale\\&quot; design.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having tons of fun with all the design choices...</li>
            <li> As a first time nail stamp user, I can&#x27;t wait to see how these cool designs work.</li>
            <li> I did when I wrote my first review, so the full designs don&#x27;t cover all my nails.</li>
            <li> I own Bundle Monster, Kaying(faux-nad), and now Red Angel plates.</li>
            <li> I think these would make a nice addition to any collection and lets hope that this manufacture will listen to demands and make plate images BIGGER!</li>
            <li> This is going to be so much fun.  </li>
            <li> Stamps clear images for the most part.  </li>
            <li> the plates just weren&#x27;t clear when stamped, but I&#x27;m pleased with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This collection of plates certainly is not disappointing.  </li>
            <li> but for the price their still worth it</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Its worth the money</li>
            <li> I would even go as far as to say that I like them better than Konad.</li>
            <li> The images on the plates are clear and they are easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Some could be bigger, but for the most part, they fit my nails and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to make my own for this set, but it would definitely improve the plates if they came with it.  </li>
            <li> Overall they are nice......</li>
            <li> Easy to use, high quality plates.  </li>
            <li> They are worth getting and the price is right.</li>
            <li> The images are well defined, and there are many interesting full-nail images that I&#x27;ve never seen in the other brands.</li>
            <li> I really love the unique designs on these Red Angel plates.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> there are lots of images to choose from, and the shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li> These designs are so unique and stamp very well.</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I wanted and the shipping was very fast!</li>
            <li> The image quality is not as good as some other brands</li>
            <li> just right.  </li>
            <li> right.</li>
            <li> For example, the image of the phoenix is facing right.</li>
            <li> I started using them right away.</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> I love my new plates, I have many different designs to choose from.  </li>
            <li> I really love the Red Angel nail stamping plates, they have some really cool designs on them.</li>
            <li> If this is your first set of stamping plates, be sure you also order a stamper and scraper (though an old gift card works just as well)</li>
            <li> awesome images, different designs than just the average butterfly and flowers.</li>
            <li> I get clean lines and the impressions have all been very consistent.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how many different designs, and how many plates I was able to receive for such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, I know the designs are super cute, but you won&#x27;t be satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> probably less cutesy and more sophisticated than the shany ones.  </li>
            <li> I really like the amount of full nail images in this kit</li>
            <li> The images are awesome &amp; are large enough to cover all fingers including the thumb nail which is an issue with some other brands.</li>
            <li> and I would most definitely put these on you high priority list!!!</li>
            <li> The stamps come out nice and clean and sharp !</li>
            <li> The plates are deep enough to get great prints from them.</li>
            <li> you get so many different ones you will have so much fun with them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used at least one print off of each plate and so far, they are absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li> Plus i got it super fast ^_^</li>
            <li> There are some cute images, and the full nail images are large enough for my thumb.  </li>
            <li> Overall I think that it is a good deal for image plates, and has very unique designs separate from other image plates from Konad or Bundle Monster.  </li>
            <li> The designs are all unique and fun and original to Red Angel.</li>
            <li> So far everything I have tried to stamp with them, stamps easily and the first time.  </li>
            <li> It shipped very fast and you get a lot of designs for what you&#x27;re paying.</li>
            <li> Sent to me very fast.  </li>
            <li> Stamping plates arrived very fast and all but one, RA110, works.</li>
            <li> The shipment came very fast.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Very, very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> They still did good, I just wish they were a little deeper set</li>
            <li> I am excited to have a new NOTD look every day.</li>
            <li> The designs on these plates are all new and unique.</li>
            <li> so happy that theres people seeling this hard to find product</li>
            <li> 6 of my plates are damaged with either pock marks near the designs or huge scratches running through the plates.</li>
            <li> Out of 119 different designs 33 of them come out blurry or do not transfer appropriately.</li>
            <li> and I can use some regular nail polish with them (thicker is better</li>
            <li> I love all of the different designs on the plates.</li>
            <li> This was my first set and now I&#x27;m hooked</li>
            <li> I love my Red Angel nail plates!</li>
            <li> i look forward to more plates in the future</li>
            <li> I cut myself twice while trying to remove the film on the first plate I used with this set.</li>
            <li> I gave four stars because I would really like them to have a backing!</li>
            <li> This was the first set I got after I tried the Salon Express kit.  </li>
            <li> They are pretty affordable.  </li>
            <li> but after getting the red angel plates, I think I will stick with these because they&#x27;re a better price</li>
            <li> The image in the top left corner which looks like snowflakes and Christmas ornaments was not on the plate.</li>
            <li> It looks like the top image on the French plate 101.</li>
            <li> I had much better luck with designs stamping with the entire image fully covered with polish</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a number of heart themed ones as well as a couple that say &#x27;love&#x27; in various pretty ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We are already aware of this situation.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> i love my red angel plates, use them all the time.</li>
            <li> This was my first step of stamping plates</li>
            <li> and I really like them!</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> I love the designs especially the smiley faces.</li>
            <li> People always ask how I&#x27;m able to get such intricate designs myself.</li>
            <li> my darling daughter  loves it so much!</li>
            <li> : cost, designs are cute (especially the smilies)</li>
            <li> ;)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> is faulty, so don&#x27;t discard them, but make sure to buy a different stamping pad to go with these plates.</li>
            <li> I couldnt really point out any flaws in these plates!</li>
            <li> i used keankolor, opi, china glaze and the konad specialty polish, which all scraped off pretty well..</li>
            <li> The only issue like many of the customers has is that it doesn&#x27;t have a backing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is my sincere hope that Red Angel has solved this problem, by now.</li>
            <li> ;)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Shipping was beyond fast!</li>
            <li> I love the red angel stamping set....</li>
            <li> They need some more hello kitty designs, breast cancer ribbons, an aunk and even a Celtic knot on the next set.</li>
            <li> This is the first collection I purchased after I saw a review on YouTube.</li>
            <li> This is such a deal (or a steal) for the fact that the Konad plates are more pricey just for 1.</li>
            <li> Full size nail stamps didn&#x27;t fit my entire nail.</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> When the plates arrive, and the blue protective plastic is removed, most of the plates arrive damaged.  </li>
            <li> Items showed up in good condition and in just a few days.</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for beginners because you have to know a few tricks to get optimum results.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these plates to anyone in love with nail art, even the inexperienced nail-lover will get endless joy out of these.</li>
            <li> Sweet new designs.</li>
            <li> plate with acetone before first use then as needed to keep design clean and concise.</li>
            <li> I like this set, the designs are new &amp; fresh which is exciting because I have a slight obsession with nail stamping &amp; own many sets from different brands.</li>
            <li> Some of the full nail designs are smaller some bigger which can be nice.</li>
            <li> So when I was looking for some new image plates, I needed to spend as little as possible but still get a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Red Angel \\&quot;nailed\\&quot; it!  </li>
            <li> Sure enough, a few days later, they arrived and I am very impressed with the prompt action and courtesy JMGlobal provided.</li>
            <li> I really like how there are so many different designs</li>
            <li> * - Make sure to use nail polishes that are more opaque and thick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very good at the stamping yet, but the practicing I did on paper had nice clean lines.</li>
            <li> I am new to nail art stamping and these are the very first set of plates that I bought.</li>
            <li> I found them easy to use, and worked well with ordinary nail polish in many cases.</li>
            <li> Other than that I&#x27;m beyond pleased with the super fast shipping and quality of the plates.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about some of the new designs that this particular brand offered</li>
            <li> I put that kit away and pretty much gave up and put the kit</li>
            <li> I love these stamping plates, I love the designs pretty different from some other brands.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> this is still a great value (even with shipping cost), and i would still recommend it to friends, although i can not express this enough: please take caution with the sharp edges, as it is not an exaggeration.</li>
            <li> My ten year old niece likes the designs, great for tiny nails.</li>
            <li> They were shipped fast and the were exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed, although I will say that the edges of the plates are a little sharp!</li>
            <li> I decided to try out the Red Angel plates for the first time and they have been a HUGE hit.</li>
            <li> If you are super careful, it&#x27;s fine though.</li>
            <li> I have purchased \\&quot;Shany\\&quot; plates as well as many single Konad plates.</li>
            <li> The images on the plates are too large for my nails.</li>
            <li> On using these plates: Let me start of by saying that they certainly did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not an issue, or certainly shouldn&#x27;t be imo.</li>
            <li> Images are large and well-cut.</li>
            <li> The blue plastic was easy to remove much to my delight.    </li>
            <li> If Red Angel wants to send me new some plates with better images, then I&#x27;m all for it.</li>
            <li> I bought the Konad stamper and these stamp plates--lots of different designs to choose from, and they work just fine.  </li>
            <li> Just received my new Red Angel nail stamp plates, and I am very excited to try them out.</li>
            <li> The designs are large and there is no problem covering the whole nail (unlike BM series 1)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> good mix of single, full, tips, and half moon patterns.&lt;br /&gt;High</li>
            <li> I scrape lightly as I want to leave as much polish as possible for the transfer</li>
            <li> Very upset at this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d really like to know though</li>
            <li> So I ordered this after extensive checking to see what was available price versus value</li>
            <li> They all show up really well</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t about to spend so much just for one plate.</li>
            <li> If a second set becomes available I would buy it.</li>
            <li> They came fast and I tried them that night.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any real quality problems.</li>
            <li> These plates work really well.  </li>
            <li> BUT I REALLY DONT LIKE</li>
            <li> YOU REALLY NEED TO PUT BACKING ON THEM</li>
            <li> WOULDN&#x27;T REALLY RECOMMEND THESE</li>
            <li> Second, the shany plates have sticky residue left from the plastic film while the red angel plates have a nice smooth surface.   </li>
            <li> They stamp very well.</li>
            <li> I plan on asking the seller for a replacement because I really wanted that one.</li>
            <li> and they all seemed to transfer really well, so I am updating from 3 stars to 4.</li>
            <li> (Sometimes I apply too much pressure)</li>
            <li> And for $13, can you really think of a reason why not?</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast as well.</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot</li>
            <li> Very impressive.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> I really want my money back.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> One had too much etched space and didn&#x27;t stamp well</li>
            <li> One plate come  very damage</li>
            <li> that did not work at all no matter how fast I worked, it was the image of the girl.&lt;br</li>
            <li> how fast you have to be.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t use konad polishes) pick up really well, and for $15 it really can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> These images transfer very well.</li>
            <li> and i really do like the images.</li>
            <li> The seller was very accomadating.</li>
            <li> I cleaned them up well, but it didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li> I really recommend these.</li>
            <li> i really like the selection that these plates offer.</li>
            <li> I got the item and it was more than I expected.</li>
            <li> It was at a reasonable price for this type of product.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, many of the images had missing areas when transferred.</li>
            <li> Kind of disappointing, but overall the plates are still a great value.</li>
            <li> I look forward to trying some of the designs very soon.</li>
            <li> Had a lil delay because of post office loosing package but seller was very helpful and send out a replacement.</li>
            <li> I really wanted these sets ..</li>
            <li> Highly recommend you try these plates!</li>
            <li> I am still getting use to the whole stamping process</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t listen to all the negative reviews this is a good way to get started.</li>
            <li> My 9 year old put a nice slice in her hand when she was using these and it bled like crazy and gave me a good scare.  </li>
            <li> They come nicely packaged in a heavy plastic storage pouch.</li>
            <li> (i have natural short nails), it would come out more like lines and geometric designs instead of an image or background.</li>
            <li> The number of image plates that&#x27;s sold as a set are a dynamic deal and very economically priced.  </li>
            <li> and I like how different they are from most of the other sets available.</li>
            <li> It would have been nice if i can have the phoenix facing right for one hand and the other hand have it facing left.</li>
            <li> The full nail designs are large enough to go way over my thumbs.</li>
            <li> They have so many designs you won&#x27;t find on other brand&#x27;s plates.</li>
            <li> They are etched deep enough to get a rich colorful print!</li>
            <li> I was excited to get my Red Angle Nail Art plates</li>
            <li> The tip designs don&#x27;t fit on my thumbs, but I must have larger thumb nails than most average women.  </li>
            <li> Most of these designs are dupes of other brands.  </li>
            <li> i have konad, bundle monster and some other one, and i really am glad i bought this one.  </li>
            <li> but I have other stamps that I love.</li>
            <li> I love the images, they are very wide in range of topics.</li>
            <li> the designs are new and innovative not the same old thing you see all the time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to pay a few more bucks for that.</li>
            <li> Also, because they are etched deeply, they are a pain to clean with cotton or q-tips, or anything that leaves lint or can snag...because it will...</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I got my new red angel plates, I tried them out right away and after much trial and error finally got it right.</li>
            <li> Very original designs on those plates, no exact dupes of Konad or bundle monster plates....</li>
            <li> Not all the plates work very well, they are not deep enough, so the stamping is very light.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for other nail stamping junkies like me. :-)</li>
            <li> The deep etching allows for time for placement [not as much problem with polish drying on stamp] and a bold imprint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The images stamp crisp and clear with both regular and special Konad stamping polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> all the images transferred crisp and clear.</li>
            <li> full nail designs are larger which works well longer nails.</li>
            <li> I just wish they had backing and that the full images and French tips were a bit wider.</li>
            <li> These Angel full stamp images are same size as a konad image.</li>
            <li> ohh and some of the dessigns are kind of too small for my nail.</li>
            <li> The full nail designs need to be BIGGER.</li>
            <li> I thought that the deeper-set images would give and advantage when transferring, but in practicality, that means more polish, which means it doesnt dry as fast(could be a good thing or bad) and the volume of polish transferred made it easy for me to smudge the design.</li>
            <li> Nice designs, they look pretty shallow</li>
            <li> I have tried every single design as soon as I got in the mail (which by the way was SUPER fast) and they all stamp on with no problem!</li>
            <li> I hope they keep coming out with new ones!</li>
            <li> None of full nails images pick up the full design, and even if that wasn&#x27;t a problem, the full nail images are too narrow to cover the entire width of all the nails.</li>
            <li> First of all the shany nail plates have a blue plastic film which is impossible to take off, the red angels come off so easily, I was impressed.  </li>
            <li> This was an international order, so I ended up paying more money for the post rather than for the actual item...</li>
            <li> The full designs fit my nails well, although my nails are quite small.  </li>
            <li> Images are the same size as the Konads, but they are more deeply and intracately engraved.  </li>
            <li> Go find a dude with decent sized nails and throw some patterns in that would cover HIS nails.</li>
            <li> but the designs are etched deep enough on most plates</li>
            <li> will definitely order red angel nail plates again. :)</li>
            <li> Love the designs - all totally different from 1st &amp; 2nd Bundle Monster sets.</li>
            <li> I am currently making it my mission to purchase as many nail stamping sets as possible!  </li>
            <li> This set is very good works just as well (if not better) as the more expensive plates.</li>
            <li> Some of the images are hard to clean because the lines are so fine like the heart and line tip on plate</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these for their price and uniqueness.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these for their price and uniqueness.</li>
            <li> , spend your money on those brands, if don&#x27;t want to pay the high price for Konad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I wish they had the backing like some of the others do, but if you handle them carefully you&#x27;ll be fine.  </li>
            <li> Different images from the other popular brands.  </li>
            <li> I love the little package they come in.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s a little blood for cute nails though?  </li>
            <li> sharp edges are true!  </li>
            <li> Now my only problem is deciding which one to use first!  </li>
            <li> One of the plates came HIGHLY damaged with a huge gauge of a scratch right down the middle, and another was lightly scratched several times like something had scraped it.</li>
            <li> plates are easy to handle and there wasn&#x27;t any sharp edges since there are paper backing for each of the plates.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, the edges are extremely uneven and will cause many little cuts on your fingers, as many others have mentioned in their reviews.</li>
            <li> The full nail designs are large enough to cover my whole nail, but just not the nail on my big toe.</li>
            <li> I did find out that if the polish is too thin, then the color would not be bright as it should be</li>
            <li> Love the little plastic storage case, it&#x27;s a little flimsy, but has stood up to the sharp edged plates so far, and it&#x27;s great to have something provided to store/organize the plates in.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They have fresh designs and are etched deeply.</li>
            <li> and I press more firmly to transfer.</li>
            <li> If I have one complaint one lace design would have been nice.  </li>
            <li> this is not worth the money I spent on them which is a shame because they do have some good looking designs.</li>
            <li> There were some complaints about not having a backing and that the edges were sharp but if you don&#x27;t handle them recklessly then you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> These came nicely packaged in a little soft plastic envelope and while I haven&#x27;t tried all the plates yet, the few designs I tested worked just fine.</li>
            <li> Also, the whole nail images are larger than most of the other knock off brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The designs are really different for example the snowflake is more detailed than other dupe brands, I  even think a lot of them are even cooler looking than the real Konad ones, and they seem nicer than other dupe brands.</li>
            <li> The designs are very pretty; the full nail designs do seem a bit small but workable.</li>
            <li> a set of 21 pieces,some designs are large enough to cover the whole nail.all</li>
            <li> I have konad and bundle monster plates and these are mostly new designs not offered by either konad or bundle monster.  </li>
            <li> They have a lot of new designs that I have not seen before.</li>
            <li> I am new to nail stamping and purchased these plates to begin my collection.</li>
            <li> you are new to nail stamping then</li>
            <li> I am new at nail stamping.  </li>
            <li> As many people have already said, they don&#x27;t have paper backing, but I haven&#x27;t experienced any problems cutting or even scratching myself, so don&#x27;t consider this a down side.   </li>
            <li> It was too late for me but good for everyone in the future.</li>
            <li> a few konads and both Bundle Monster sets, and the Red Angel plates had a lot of unique designs (and lots of full nail designs that i prefer).</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how well these were etched.  </li>
            <li> Plates look very professional and durable</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried each one and they all stamp extremely well...!!! :)</li>
            <li> Some finer images like the butterfly on RA-119 are hard to work more than once since it is really hard to clean the tiny engravings (and it just won&#x27;t stamp unless very clean).</li>
            <li> Since the seller provided larger image views of the plates on the website, I was excited to see such a different variety of images.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaged neatly and Shipped fast!  </li>
            <li> These plates do not stamp QUITE as crisp as Konad but one can only tell under close scrutiny that their crispness is not up to Konad standards.</li>
            <li> So far I am very satisfied with this purchase, and I am sure I won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was also excited for plate RA-118 because of the snowflake for the same reason, however, there was not a snowflake on my plate and instead was just a generic looking flower.</li>
            <li> The image on my RA-107 plate in the bottom left corner was an amoeba looking stamp, similar to the stamp on RA-113 top left.  </li>
            <li> When I use my Konad plates I usually have time to double check the image and make sure I position it on the nail exactly where I want it.</li>
            <li> designs are so cute and a lot different from other plates we can find everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Too</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> but overall these are very well made!</li>
            <li> first off, i ordered mine on November 20th and received it November 23rd....</li>
            <li> Their ok and do their job, the only thing is they rally sharp and need be handle</li>
            <li> These plates have so many different images not repeated ones like the other plates.</li>
            <li> Unfourtnately several images don&#x27;t stamp well at all, it seems the etching isn&#x27;t consistent and the images won&#x27;t transfer.</li>
            <li> I have not stamped with these yet but just from what I have seen on blogs and from my inspection of the plates they all look to be cleanly engraved and deep enough that the polish wont scrap out.  </li>
            <li> other stamping designs look pretty big too compared to designs from other kind of plates i got.</li>
            <li> The designs are super cute, but the edges of the round disks are razor sharp!  </li>
            <li> I even wasted too much money on \\&quot;special nail polish.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> But again it was a true bargain as I&#x27;ve only paid 20 Euro in total.</li>
            <li> The full nail images cover all but my thumb nail completely and I have wide nail beds.</li>
            <li> Another reviewer called them whimsical, I believe, and that&#x27;s pretty apt.  </li>
            <li> AND The first set of plates (MASH) that I bought, had small full nail designs.</li>
            <li> The company was nice enough to plate them, but those replacements were not much better.</li>
            <li> Also they arrived quickly considering that I live on the other end of the planet (it took 2 weeks).   </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get used to using these if you have never used them before, you have to be quick before the polish dries though, but they are fun to play with.</li>
            <li> It can be fixed, you can get crafty and take half of the butterfly wings, but that&#x27;s not the point.  </li>
            <li> The designs are large enough for my nails.  </li>
            <li> I will certainly purchase items from them in the future!</li>
            <li> not just copies of other plates (which is why I bought them even though I have more plates than I could possibly need :O) )</li>
            <li> I have bought a few different sets of these from different companies and I would def rate these among the top 3!</li>
            <li> Images are clear.</li>
            <li> They should really add them back.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just waiting for someone too do a complete holiday collection because I don&#x27;t want to buy each one separately.</li>
            <li> I have used three images so far and have found that one of them doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The designs are like none that I have seen so far that is one of the factors that led me to have my husband purchase the set for me.</li>
            <li> some of the whole nail designs are smaller they do cover the majority of the fingernails.</li>
            <li> You will straight slice yourself open on these.</li>
            <li> the very first thing i noticed was the sharp edges.</li>
            <li> I only had to send an email and they responded really fast.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t pick up the polish well, nor transfer it to the nail completely.</li>
            <li> For the one or two designs I enjoy using the rest of the product is a waste.</li>
            <li> So far, I have tried about six plates and</li>
            <li> /&gt;However Konad plates are $5-6 each, while Red Angel plates were @$15 for 21 plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to value per dollar spent, I don&#x27;t think you can come up with a better buy than Red Angel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional nail tech and use them all the time.  </li>
            <li> The images are clean and sharp, the stamps are big enough even for thumb nails and they shipped fast!  </li>
            <li> So, although there are still quite a few designs I cannot use, I am overall happy with the ones I can use, I am only sad that I am not able to use all of the great new designs.</li>
            <li> They arrived very quickly and I haven&#x27;t put them down!!</li>
            <li> I tried the plate right after I received, and I did not really like them.</li>
            <li> Every other plate company I have ordered from (Mash, Bundle Monster, and a generic plate company) have always been completely accurate with the pictures and descriptions.   </li>
            <li> the only thing that i believe is important to say is that they are too sharp..</li>
            <li> While this is less than a 30% failure rate, the majority of them are the full nail designs, which are my favorite ones to use.</li>
            <li> I have had success with other plates.  </li>
            <li> but if I had to pick which nail plates were better, I would definitely pick red angel plates, HANDS DOWN.  </li>
            <li> The designs are too shallow, so whenever I scrape off the excess polish, there goes most of the design, too.</li>
            <li> better then before they are still ridiculously</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;ve had this set for some time and the only images I use any more are the small ones.</li>
            <li> I have many other plates from other manufacturers that do not have backing, however, I cut my finger on one when I was removing the protective film.</li>
            <li> Being my first time, I obviously need to get the hang of it and practice a bit, but that&#x27;s the same with all nail stamping plates.  </li>
            <li> I purchased these back in December and used them for the first and last time in February.</li>
            <li> I would like to see some plates with only one design on it, but with different sizes of that same design to fit onto different size nails</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, would definitely buy from again!  </li>
            <li> I actually like these Red Angel ones better because they are a little deeper</li>
            <li> I have only had a problem stamping with a few of them, but when I try different polishes they do seem to do better.</li>
            <li> However, with this kit, I have had minimal problems with getting images to stamp and the images come out crisp.</li>
            <li> Thankfully they were almost exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing is that these images are kind of small , the full plate ones are slightly less than half an inch</li>
            <li> I felt like these plates had the designs I was looking for and other than being VERY sharp, as I&#x27;ve read most plates</li>
            <li> Not a single complain here!!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait for the next new idea from them.</li>
            <li> next, as i looked at the images, i saw lots of new designs that i haven&#x27;t seen before.</li>
            <li> Even though these are so cheap compared to the Konad plates, they are a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> My only issue with these plates is the same as the original BM Plates, the sharp edges.</li>
            <li> RED ANGEL HAS FIXED THIS PROBLEM AND EACH PLATE COMES WITH A BACKING!</li>
            <li> Love these only a few designs are not deep enough.  </li>
            <li> so given that twelve out of the twenty plates are full nail designs and the one tip plate is also too small, I don&#x27;t get much use out of them.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t discourage anybody from buying them because I still think they have some of the prettiest images so if you have smaller hands and the patience to keep stamping the same image over and over, go for it.</li>
            <li> the images are cut too deep a lot of the images get smeared and they snag when u try to clean them so little hairs always get stuck, my fairy images have no wings so they look like strippers.</li>
            <li> I gave it two stars because at least some of the plates were fine, but the majority of them were warped plates.</li>
            <li> However apparently my nails must be considered Very Long and wide as the only fingers the images fit are my ring and pinkie</li>
            <li> On a couple of the plates there are deep scratches, but only 2 designs are affected, and I didn&#x27;t care for those particular ones anyway.</li>
            <li> When I try to use any of the images on these 7 plates, due to the deep etching too much polish is left after scraping and then too much polish is picked up on the stamper.  </li>
            <li> I wish the full nail images were a little larger.</li>
            <li> I bought these based on the other positive feedback I&#x27;d read</li>
            <li> like these in general.</li>
            <li> Crisp, clear stamps, with a few exceptions.</li>
            <li> No regrets buying this product what so ever.</li>
            <li> Pick yourself up a Konad double sided stamper and use an old gift card/credit card as a scraper, the metal edged scrapers WILL scratch the plates (found this out for myself).</li>
            <li> I used the plates, and they have no problem with complete coverage and picking up the entire design.</li>
            <li> fast shipping, just what i expected.</li>
            <li> are ( I just cut up some old cereal boxes and glued them to the back of the plates to prevent injury),  </li>
            <li> I have lost count of how many of these I have, I&#x27;m just addicted to all Nail Plates and polishes.</li>
            <li> This makes it kind of difficult to use consecutively.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We will implement paper back for our next new batch.</li>
            <li> and my customers keep coming back because I very regularly invest in new designs for them.</li>
            <li> Any other brand I can use the same nail polish on, but only one of my polishes will transfer over from these plates with any success.</li>
            <li> It did seem some were more shallow than others when I was stamping different ones all w/the same polish.&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful</li>
            <li> Because i red the reviews before purchasing, i was aware of the sharp edges</li>
            <li> Some of the full nail sized images are too shallow to pick up will and transfer completely across the nail-</li>
            <li> I fund this plate set a bit hard to clean then my others.</li>
            <li> The other plates work very well</li>
            <li> but they are so hard to clean</li>
            <li> Other than that, I really like it</li>
            <li> Not the best but far from the worst.</li>
            <li> but once you take your stamper to get the image, the color splatters out because the images were cut so deep, that when you try to transfer it, the entire image is blotted and completely distorted.</li>
            <li> only problem was that the full nail images were a bit on the small side.</li>
            <li> In all fairness I didn&#x27;t use it with special polish, just regular polish and I was mostly scraping with an old card because the metal scraper I have scrapes my plates which is annoying.</li>
            <li> If I had no other choice I would have kept these, but I am still looking for a bulk order that actually works the way it should.</li>
            <li> If I was to slow it would only transfer half the image and the other half was dried on my stamp, but if I was really fast it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> I used several different brands of nail polish and the engravings are deep so that a clear image is achieved regardless of the nail polish I used.</li>
            <li> so I got a set, I have only used a few designs, but I really like these plates so far.</li>
            <li> They have no backing to them like bundle monster or konad and they can cut you if you&#x27;re not careful pulling the blue plastic off before using.  </li>
            <li> At first I had a duplicate of #19 and missing #5.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used all of the images on the Red Angel plates, but the ones I&#x27;ve used stamped just as well as the far more expensive Konad plates.</li>
            <li> It has just the right amount of full-nail designs with a bit of small designs as well.</li>
            <li> but when I tried the stamp it only really made an impact on my thumb, which I find is typical for stamping plates</li>
            <li> They came in a little plastic pouch that can be used for storage and had the proper backing, even the blue plastic came of without much fuss.</li>
            <li> Also, if you are too slow during removing the excess polish on the plates and stamping the design on to the stamper, then most of the time the design would not be fully transferred onto the stamper since some of the polish might be already dried.</li>
            <li> A few of the small single item designs work okay, but not good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have three of them that have missing or half cut out designs, and one of the plates are not even a full circle.</li>
            <li> The only thing I dont like are the sharp edges because they do not have the paper on the back, but this is easily fixed with a roll of the sticky paper used to line cabinets.</li>
            <li> Many of the designs are whimsical and while I was skeptical as to if the designs would transfer to my nails, the etching was iffy on some of the plates, they did so easily.  </li>
            <li> These are about half an inch wide, so I&#x27;d have to double stamp my thumbs a little bit and some longer nails to get full nail image coverage.</li>
            <li> also, because the images were cut deep, it made it a little more difficult to clean them out, and like the edge of the plates, the images also have a similar sharp edge, so you&#x27;ll have some small shreds of cotton in the picture that you&#x27;ll need to go back over to remove.  </li>
            <li> My only issue with these are that they have VERY SHARP edges - much sharper than other brand plates.</li>
            <li> So far, I have only tested about half of the designs in set</li>
            <li> You have a variety of choices regardless of your nail length being either long or  short.</li>
            <li> While I have long nail beds, I keep my nails fairly short.</li>
            <li> I would reccomend this to anyone new to stamping, some of the pictures could be engraved a little deeper to get all those details</li>
            <li> Some images are similar to other manufacturer&#x27;s but there were some different images that I did not have in my vast Image Plate collection.  </li>
            <li> These seem to not be engraved as deep as the Konad plates, so the polish is thinner on the stamp and therefore dry&#x27;s faster!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There was an early version of these plates where some of the fairies were missing their wings, however I got the later, corrected version.  </li>
            <li> As an additional note these are roughly the same size as all of the standard plates out there</li>
            <li> They appear sharp, but i haven&#x27;t cut myself yet and I am not exactly careful when I handle them.</li>
            <li> Compared to other brands, you can only get 3 or max 4 plates with the same amount of money...</li>
            <li> no backing on the plates so be careful for sharp edges but otherwise images are clear and pick up well on stamper.</li>
            <li> The only \\&quot;con\\&quot; is that there is no paper backing which makes them sharp, and makes the blue film a pain to take off...</li>
            <li> It came as promised and performs just as well as some of the other more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> , so I knew they would be sharp without a backing, but fixed that by filing them down with the coarse end of a nail file.  </li>
            <li> I had read other reviews and knew to watch for the sharp edges, but was surprised when I opened it up and every plate had a backing on it.</li>
            <li> careful about edges this is my 3rd purchase of plates, this one does not have a backing.</li>
            <li> even if you&#x27;re careful, it only takes one moment for it to slip your grip, and before you know it, you&#x27;ve already cut yourself.</li>
            <li> so if you have long or wide nails, you&#x27;ll have to double stamp.</li>
            <li> only qualm is that the sides are a little sharp so if you&#x27;re not careful you can cut your finger and that these need a proper carrying case-</li>
            <li> I am new to the whole world of nail art, and being that I am not a free-hand artist by any means, I am addicted to these image plates!</li>
            <li> I previously had the Konad plates, which are more expensive.  </li>
            <li> Also, the designs cover maybe half my finger, they&#x27;re so much smaller than the regular Konad plates.</li>
            <li> My experience with previous nail stamping kits (I have not used Konad yet) has been that some of the designs are not deep enough and do not stamp well.</li>
            <li> I only gave it a 4 star rating because they do have sharp edges, and no backing.  </li>
            <li> The plates are ruff due to deep etching and cotton fiber sticks to etching.</li>
            <li> but can still handle them, but be extra careful!</li>
            <li> The only issue I saw was that they have no backing and could be rather sharp around the edges, so take care when handling them.  </li>
            <li> Red Angel have designs that I have not seen in any other collection of nail plate designs.</li>
            <li> but in reality it is much smaller than the other four stamps on the plate.  </li>
            <li> I discovered 2 other plates than the Red Angel plates.</li>
            <li> These Red Angel nail plates have designs that you will not see in any other set.</li>
            <li> I still had issues with a few new ones and they have extremely sharp edges.</li>
            <li> I can hardly get a full design on, and I have small fingers.</li>
            <li> Even so, I had to be very careful to get the entire nail covered from cuticle to tip.</li>
            <li> That problem,was fix once I waited a couple of seconds for the nail polish to dry a bit.</li>
            <li> I am very dissapointed, because the images on the plates are too shallow, hence the reason the pattern is not ;</li>
            <li> but there are no real full size designs big enough for the average nail.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the designs aren&#x27;t etched deep enough and they have a bit of trouble transferring</li>
            <li> I have only found a couple images in the entire 21 plate set that I had trouble with.</li>
            <li> Yes, the plates are a bit sharp in the back, so be careful.  </li>
            <li> Just as others have said the only down side is the sharpness of the plates.  </li>
            <li> The only con is that unlike the Konad plates, these plates are very sharp on the edges.</li>
            <li> Second, they are VERY sharp.</li>
            <li> , i did cut myself a few times just by looking through them, but i put a sticky back foam paper on the back of them and it didn&#x27;t make them sharp anymore.</li>
            <li> (ex: white polish will appears to be gray on a black background).</li>
            <li> I was sent 2 wrong plates in my set, but they quickly replaced them.    </li>
            <li> they were a little thin but with this new set they fixed that.</li>
            <li> A little personal awareness and the problem is solved.</li>
            <li> my little boy cut his finger when he was helping me peel off the blue protective film.  </li>
            <li> but if only the plates have paper backing just so the edges of the plate won&#x27;t be that sharp, plus there are two plates that had scraches on them but thank God that didn&#x27;t ruin the images!!</li>
            <li> A huge disappointment in shiny steel</li>
            <li> so i was careful.</li>
            <li> Just be careful when handling them.</li>
            <li> Please  be careful.    </li>
            <li> so be careful</li>
            <li> and I immediately got an e-mail back with apologies and the note that they would send the two missing plates a.s.a.p.  </li>
            <li> A couple of days later I received the 2 missing plates.  </li>
            <li> it was everything I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried a few...</li>
            <li> Item was protected and sent in a few short days.</li>
            <li> Came before expected ship date</li>
            <li> Red Angel images are cute, but worthless if they don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The edges are sharp so be careful.</li>
            <li> The edges are sharp, so do be careful...</li>
            <li> Could use a paper backing to protect fingers from the sharp edge; but isn&#x27;t a problem if you are careful.  </li>
            <li> Not much success stamping the designs, but I have only tried a few.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different things and still not good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not complaining, I was just confused at first when I opened it and thought I was missing one when I realized</li>
            <li> No backing on the plates which leaves the edges sharp so be mindful of this, doesn&#x27;t bother me though.</li>
            <li> So I guess they aren&#x27;t as sharp as they appear.</li>
            <li> The edges on the plates can be sharp, but I haven&#x27;t modified my plates in any way yet (felt backing, sanding the edges, etc) and I haven&#x27;t cut myself on them yet.</li>
            <li> I will just use butterfly wings that I have on other plates to make them look like fairies, but the wings on the Fairies were not etched into the plate.  </li>
            <li> Other plates I use</li>
            <li> They also did not duplicate any other plates that I already had.</li>
            <li> Edges if paletts are a but to sharp.</li>
            <li> THE FACT THAT THE EDGES ARE EXTREMELY SHARP WHEN I WAS PULLING THE PLASTIC</li>
            <li> so they are razor sharp.</li>
            <li> Also, because of the razor sharp edges on these stamps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking, given other reviews, that it&#x27;s just luck of the draw whether or not yours take polish well or not.  </li>
            <li> etch quality is pretty random in ALL</li>
            <li> the edges sharp?  </li>
            <li> They arrived with no backing, and a plastic coating which needed some care to remove because the edges are sharp.  </li>
            <li> these plates have no backing, which would lead you to believe that they are sharp; I did not find this to be the case, I even ran the edges across the skin of my hands and didnt have any problems.</li>
            <li> ON THE OVERLY SHARP EDGES.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is nothing in the description warning people they are so sharp and could be cut....</li>
            <li> so they are sharp.  </li>
            <li> the edges are sharp</li>
            <li> I thought product I was receiving was images in pictures taken by other customers.</li>
            <li> These plates are slightly sharp on the edges, but we have not had any cuts from them.  </li>
            <li> Sharp edges, they could use some paper backings.</li>
            <li> plates and was expecting them to be sharper on the edges based on other reviews.</li>
            <li> designs are like nothing I&#x27;ve seen on other plates.</li>
            <li> i thought the blogs and reviews i read were exagerating, but they truly are sharp.</li>
            <li> how sharp, you ask?..</li>
            <li> I have other name brands and just wanted to add to my collection of designs with this set.</li>
            <li> But I feel that other customers need to know what they may be getting, if they order these plates.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried any other plates other than the ones that came with my salon express.</li>
            <li> small full-nail images are the only reason I wouldn&#x27;t give this product a 5-star rating.</li>
            <li> some times the image issue might be due to the polish or the technique you are using.</li>
            <li> Not really much else to say!</li>
            <li> Package was sticky and had other products&#x27; labels on them.  </li>
            <li> I have to be very careful when looking through the plates so as to not cut myself - other than that</li>
            <li> Be very careful.</li>
            <li> I received my red angel plates a few days ago and decided to try out a few stamps before making my review.  </li>
            <li> so they are sharp but its not a problem for me putting backpaper, just be extremely careful!!</li>
            <li> I have wider thumb nails a little over 1/2 inch wide.</li>
            <li> only down fall and complaint with them is the sides are sharp</li>
            <li> and they now come backed with paper so ignore all the previous reviews about them being sharp and without a paper backing.  </li>
            <li> The only negative thing is that they are unfinished and have no backing</li>
            <li> Not sure why everyone including konad thinks that we all have short narrow nails.  </li>
            <li> I solved this by creating backing using double sided tape and thick stock paper.</li>
            <li> The cut on the plate is too deep, so the images are thick and smear on the nail when I stamp it.</li>
            <li> images on the plates are really rough and uneven.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have about them is that the edges are very sharp.</li>
            <li> Seven across and eight down.</li>
            <li> BEING EXTREMELY SHARP!</li>
            <li> The plates do have a paper-backing so that the edges aren&#x27;t so sharp!</li>
            <li> Also, the edges of the plates are VERY sharp.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with the designs picking up, like some of the other plates.  </li>
            <li> The missing star is because these plates are still extremely SHARP.</li>
            <li> These plates (like all the others) are VERY sharp</li>
            <li> just one issue is that they are very sharp...</li>
            <li> Half off the designs won&#x27;t even go on the stamper.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not your typical flower design (though there are some of those).</li>
            <li> And third, some shany plates are so difficult to get the design on the stamper, while the red angel is easier and have deeper cuts.  </li>
            <li> I say about half don&#x27;t work as well</li>
            <li> sorry for my english, I&#x27;m french.</li>
            <li> IGNORE PREVIOUS REVIEWS OF THE EDGES</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been cut into a half crescent.</li>
            <li> and my thumb is just over half an inch</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to nail art and don&#x27;t have a lot of cash to be spending on expensive things that may or may not work.  </li>
            <li> I tried thin nail polish, thick nail polish, I tried letting the polish dry a little before I picked it up (which seemed to help only slightly)</li>
            <li> I guess I keep my nails a little longer thean</li>
            <li> I mailed the seller about this little mixup</li>
            <li> Plus, I&#x27;d like to do my toenails sometime in one stamp and that will never happen with these little ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As with any plates, it does take a little patience, but they work well.  </li>
            <li> with a little practice it is a cinch to do.</li>
            <li> For example, the cow print image had missing holes within the print, not cute looking at all.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am a little disappointed with the size of the full nail stamp.  </li>
            <li> last night, i was peeling the blue plastic cover off a plate and ended up cutting my finger.</li>
            <li> I just added a backing to them with some heavy cardstock, and some double-sided tape.  </li>
            <li> away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try stamping again after reading a few threads and watching videos.</li>
            <li> I wish I would not have wasted the money.</li>
            <li> One of my fairies is missing her wings</li>
            <li> I also used a few of the plates this weekend</li>
            <li> The fairy and a few</li>
            <li> They sent me the missing #5 promptly.</li>
            <li> You can just look at them at tell how uneven they are.</li>
            <li> I have a few Konad plates, that are around 6.99 each...</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been using these for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I would NOT buy another set from them, talk about a waste of money</li>
            <li> Angels on 2 plates are missing wings also.</li>
            <li> Some of the fairy designs on these sets are missing their wings.</li>
            <li> Though I haven&#x27;t used all of the plates, I already have a few favorites that I&#x27;ve used serveral times.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve tried 5 of the designs, and they are all fairly difficult to transfer over.</li>
            <li> this is just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Use some sandpaper to dull sharp edges.  </li>
            <li> Like the other reviews stated, they are very sharp around the ends and can be dangerous if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> With some of the other brands that followed Konad at least one image per plate was faulty.</li>
            <li> where angels, into just plain whores.</li>
            <li> I was getting tired of using the same ole Monster Bundle ones and some of my usual Konad ones too.</li>
            <li> These are definetly plates you have to experiment with in terms of how hard to scrape or press the stamper down</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how bad these plates turned out to be after reading all the good reviews.</li>
            <li> I had to purchase these for my little Diva!</li>
            <li> Each plate has a backing, and I was unable to find any sharp or rough edges on any of the plates.</li>
            <li> I have had success with Konad plates and was afraid to try this less expensive brand.  </li>
            <li> have stamping plates from a few other companies and these are the worse.</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve purchased the Konad kits over a year ago</li>
            <li> If you have small nails you can use a remover pen, you can also use nail extension forms around nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wipe</li>
            <li> The designs are to small for \\&quot;wider\\&quot; fingernails.</li>
            <li> The argyle pattern on my stamp has small rows of diamond shapes.</li>
            <li> Just became obsessed with stamping and have been buying different stamps to see what works.  </li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t the usual designs that you see.</li>
            <li> They come in a small plastic holder which can be kept to keep the plates in if you so desire unlike bundle monster or kondad.</li>
            <li> another.&lt;br /&gt;Great deal if you&#x27;re looking for a lot of designs for a small price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not sure if these plates are defective or what, but I would never order from this company again.</li>
            <li> The metal plates are quite thin and the edges are razor sharp.  </li>
            <li> The reason why I hate these plates is that they are so deeply etched that every image comes out smeary and totally without detail.</li>
            <li> I have very small nailbeds but some of these designs are too small even for me.  </li>
            <li> and if you press to hard they smudge.</li>
            <li> They were really hard to work with.  </li>
            <li> The plates are a little on the thin side</li>
            <li> Still would buy their next set just because for the price I can justify a few bad images.</li>
            <li> Also the plates have no backing cover on them, I recommend using a cloth, image plate holder or thick paper under then when in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The plates are a real waste of money.</li>
            <li> A real waste of your time and money.  </li>
            <li> (yes, I sat down and played with them all) and for the price I can&#x27;t complain!!!</li>
            <li> Instead my RA-113 stamp had very small argyle pattern and another stamp that looked like bubbles.</li>
            <li> All images are etched well and even very small details come out.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any issues with the etching on the stamps, none looked too shallow.</li>
            <li> The images are really shallow and don&#x27;t pick up the design at all.</li>
            <li> I have Konad and other non-Konad brands of image plates, and these are by far the worst ones.</li>
            <li> Since I had never heard of this brand I was a little skeptical about my purchase.</li>
            <li> it drew blood for a little bit, and today, the cut is making it uncomfortable to type.</li>
            <li> Too bad not to have protection on the back of each card ...</li>
            <li> Not a good reason.  </li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve given 5 stars, but some of my fairy&#x27;s were missing wings (I won&#x27;t use the fairy&#x27;s anyway), and a crown image was stamped wrong, but I probably won&#x27;t use it anyway.  </li>
            <li> Plate RA-102 in the picture is not the same as the plate that I received, which disappointed me.</li>
            <li> The next stamp that disappointed the heck out of me was plate RA-112.</li>
            <li> very sharp and dangerous</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very impressed by these nail stamping plates.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to stamp with these plates for months, and each time they come out blurry, or the imprint is too thin to hold the design.</li>
            <li> It is quite frustrating to get the images to work.</li>
            <li> However, I was not happy with them, after I tried to use them and found they did not work.  </li>
            <li> it can be frustrating.   </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m addicted.</li>
            <li> However, when I received them, they appeared dirty looking and the etchings seemed really uneven.</li>
            <li> For a cheaper set of plates, I was worried that the images on the plates would be very shallow and difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I had a small problem with 4 of my plates being gouged badly and emailed the company.</li>
            <li> Now, I was disappointed in a few things.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately two of the designs on that plate have a flaw in the engravings.</li>
            <li> You get 21 plates for $11.99 as apposed to one Konad plate for $7, can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We are sorry about the problem.</li>
            <li> , I know that I will not be bored with my nails for quite some time.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong for the money here.</li>
            <li> Although, it might sounds complicated</li>
            <li> I was convinced that I was doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> The plates feel dirty with the protective plastic in front.</li>
            <li> I worry about cutting my fingers on the edges.</li>
            <li> I ENDED UP CUTTING MY SELF</li>
            <li> A LIL DANGEROUS</li>
            <li> I tested these yesterday on paper and on some artificial nails</li>
            <li> , these plates seemed dirty when I got them.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have to buy that expensive Konad polish all the time!)  </li>
            <li> I am not changing my rating because I realized that a lot of these plates were just bad.</li>
            <li> Bad products</li>
            <li> Five out of 21 plates arrived badly damaged.  </li>
            <li> I was sadly disappointed</li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed with this set</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed in their \\&quot;improvement\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I am so incredibly disappointed by these plates and wasn&#x27;t going to leave a review, at all.</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;m disappointed I received my plates</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Really stupid.  </li>
            <li> I would like to have a set of stamping patterns that focuses on the base color.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!   </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, buy these plates, you won&#x27;t be disappointed !</li>
            <li> This is the worst product ever.</li>
            <li> immediately responded to my email and are going to replace 3 of the worst plates!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This plates are so cool! They work just as good as the Konad plates but are way cheaper (in a good way)! I love them and would recommend these to everyone!</li>
            <li> These plates are great - really happy with the variety of designs. No backing on the plates which leaves the edges sharp so be mindful of this, doesn&#x27;t bother me though. Happy to have some new designs! Reasonable postage and thrilled that I was able to have them posted to NZ, and they arrived within a week of ordering. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I tried out these images and almost all come out well. Like most plates, some images you have to scrape/fiddle with just right.  Some finer images like the butterfly on RA-119 are hard to work more than once since it is really hard to clean the tiny engravings (and it just won&#x27;t stamp unless very clean). I wish the full nail images were a little larger. I have wider thumb nails a little over 1/2 inch wide. These are about half an inch wide, so I&#x27;d have to double stamp my thumbs a little bit and some longer nails to get full nail image coverage. I just gave my friend beautiful manicures using RA-109, the two full nail leafy and flower images. They are worth getting and the price is right.</li>
            <li> I saw a friend buy these plates and immediately went to buy them. Since I had never heard of this brand I was a little skeptical about my purchase. No regrets buying this product what so ever. The product came on time, and the plates were just amazing. I was expecting something cheap but no. All the plates are one of a kind, no repeats, and stamp real well too. I don&#x27;t like the fact that they don&#x27;t have a backing but I haven&#x27;t but myself yet!! Awesome product, definitely would recommend.</li>
            <li> Because of the low price I thought I&#x27;d give it a try, and I&#x27;m glad I did!!!   This was an international order, so I ended up paying more money for the post rather than for the actual item... But again it was a true bargain as I&#x27;ve only paid 20 Euro in total. Compared to other brands, you can only get 3 or max 4 plates with the same amount of money... Also they arrived quickly considering that I live on the other end of the planet (it took 2 weeks).   Quality wise, they are amazing! I&#x27;ve been using plates from 3 different brands, and I can say that these are very good! The images are well defined, and there are many interesting full-nail images that I&#x27;ve never seen in the other brands. As many people have already said, they don&#x27;t have paper backing, but I haven&#x27;t experienced any problems cutting or even scratching myself, so don&#x27;t consider this a down side.   Overall, I would definitely recommend buying these, and I can&#x27;t wait for the second set to come out!  C.</li>
            <li> I just received my Red Angel image plates today.  I decided to try them out to see how good they were, and I loved them!  The plates have great images, and they stamped very well.  I only gave it a 4 star rating because they do have sharp edges, and no backing.  I just added a backing to them with some heavy cardstock, and some double-sided tape.  Worked great! So all in all, I would definately recommend these to my friends.</li>
            <li> The nail plates were great quality (better than some I have bought), arrived quick, just as described and had unique designs.</li>
            <li> I really love the Red Angel nail stamping plates, they have some really cool designs on them. They work just as well as the BM plates i have</li>
            <li> If you are in to nail stamping, then this is a kit you must have!&lt;br /&gt;I got this because I haven&#x27;t seen patterns like this plates have. It feature more complex looking designs that stamp beautifully. I used several different brands of nail polish and the engravings are deep so that a clear image is achieved regardless of the nail polish I used. I must say however, I have two stampers, both from konad, and I found it ease to use with Konad Staming Nail Art Stamp &amp; Scraper Set Ii, not the Double Ended Stamper And Scraper. The Double Ended Stamper And Scraper from konad is smoother so the image blurred a lot easier with this plates. That problem,was fix once I waited a couple of seconds for the nail polish to dry a bit. I fund this plate set a bit hard to clean then my others. The plates feel dirty with the protective plastic in front. Also the plates have no backing cover on them, I recommend using a cloth, image plate holder or thick paper under then when in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Cool, retro designs.&lt;br /&gt;A good mix of single, full, tips, and half moon patterns.&lt;br /&gt;High quality plates low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Harder to clean.&lt;br /&gt;No protective backing, they WILL scratch surfaces.</li>
            <li> Love these plates! I have some konad plates and these work just as well and have some very unique designs!</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve purchased the Konad kits over a year ago and I major issues with getting the image to transfer successfully.  I became very irritated and figured i wasted my money. I put that kit away and pretty much gave up and put the kit away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try stamping again after reading a few threads and watching videos. I purchased the Red Angel set of plates. My new supplies arrived, I tried again and finally got a successful transfer! I like my new plates much more than the ones in the kit so i gave my kit to someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Red Angel designs are etched into the plate deeper than the Konad designs which I believe makes it easier to pick up and transfer. For the price you get more designs at a better quality.  The only con is that unlike the Konad plates, these plates are very sharp on the edges. I solved this by creating backing using double sided tape and thick stock paper.</li>
            <li> this product does not work well. Half off the designs won&#x27;t even go on the stamper. Very upset at this product. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.  very sharp and dangerous</li>
            <li> I have had these nail plates for about a month. I love them. I really like how there are so many different designs and they aren&#x27;t all floral like some plates. They appear sharp, but i haven&#x27;t cut myself yet and I am not exactly careful when I handle them. So I guess they aren&#x27;t as sharp as they appear. The designs are etched deep and the images come out beautifully. The full nail designs are large enough to cover my whole nail, but just not the nail on my big toe. I have tested them all. You do not need to buy special stamping polish like some people claim. I use any polish. I receive many compliments my nails and I recommend these plates to everyone. I cannot wait for them to make more plates.</li>
            <li> The items were just as advertised. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy another set for myself or as a gift. They do get scratched by the scraper, but that in no way has affected the transfer quality. Save your money; get these instead.</li>
            <li> The images on the plates are too large for my nails. Also, the edges of the plates are VERY sharp.  I&#x27;ve seen the Konad system work and work well even on children&#x27;s nails, so I was expecting these to be similar.  I wish I would not have wasted the money.</li>
            <li> the designs are new and innovative not the same old thing you see all the time.  There are lots of full nail designs.  that was why I ordered the set.  I am a fan of full nail design.  the stencil covers the whole nail, a very nice size.</li>
            <li> The quality of these plates is pretty good.  I haven&#x27;t had problems with any of the stamps not coming out.  There is a good variety of different designs.  I wish there was a backing like the 2nd BM set, Cheeky, or Konad.  One thing (and the reason it  got only 4 stars) is that there are fairies on the plates.... but NO wings.  Really stupid.  Why bother?  It can be fixed, you can get crafty and take half of the butterfly wings, but that&#x27;s not the point.  They should really add them back.  Anyway, good plates for a great price.  Definitely reccomend purchasing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to stamp with these plates for months, and each time they come out blurry, or the imprint is too thin to hold the design. The designs are too shallow, so whenever I scrape off the excess polish, there goes most of the design, too. It takes me hours to do do one hand! Also, the designs cover maybe half my finger, they&#x27;re so much smaller than the regular Konad plates. I can hardly get a full design on, and I have small fingers. It only fits fully on my pinky nail.</li>
            <li> I  am very pleased with the purchase of these nail image plates!  They have some really AWESOME images!  You have a variety of choices regardless of your nail length being either long or  short. The number of image plates that&#x27;s sold as a set are a dynamic deal and very economically priced.  Since the seller provided larger image views of the plates on the website, I was excited to see such a different variety of images.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaged neatly and Shipped fast!  If this seller every decides to do another collection of nail image plates, I would definitely be a repeat customer!</li>
            <li> I have purchased \\&quot;Shany\\&quot; plates as well as many single Konad plates. I love the nail stamping plates, so when I saw this set I was instantly excited and had to have them. When I viewed the images of the plates I became ecstatic because there are so many great new designs!! I couldn&#x27;t wait!! I received the plates very quickly and the main one that I was wanting was the RA-111 plate with the \\&quot;fish scale\\&quot; design. Someone had posted a picture and it turned out really awesome, so I wanted to do this too. Unfortunately two of the designs on that plate have a flaw in the engravings. I notified the seller of this issue and sent a picture, the response was that \\&quot;this is how the plates are made and it is not a defect\\&quot;. I was sadly disappointed but when I tried the stamp it only really made an impact on my thumb, which I find is typical for stamping plates anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, that is not the biggest issue. Out of 119 different designs 33 of them come out blurry or do not transfer appropriately. While this is less than a 30% failure rate, the majority of them are the full nail designs, which are my favorite ones to use. I had hoped the problem was caused by something I was doing incorrectly. I tried thin nail polish, thick nail polish, I tried letting the polish dry a little before I picked it up (which seemed to help only slightly) but although I attempted different techniques, I kept getting the same result: an unusable design. So, although there are still quite a few designs I cannot use, I am overall happy with the ones I can use, I am only sad that I am not able to use all of the great new designs. The plates I had the most problems with are the RA-107, RA-108, RA-112, and the RA-114. Maybe it is just me, maybe not? I&#x27;d really like to know though if anyone else has had this same issue??</li>
            <li> So I ordered this after extensive checking to see what was available price versus value and I&#x27;m very happy so far. It shipped very fast and you get a lot of designs for what you&#x27;re paying. I read all the reviews before I purchased it and formed my opinion. There were some complaints about not having a backing and that the edges were sharp but if you don&#x27;t handle them recklessly then you&#x27;ll be fine. There are some incredibly cute designs. Some of the full nail designs are smaller some bigger which can be nice. All in all I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a great value for what you&#x27;re paying. Some people complain that their fairies don&#x27;t have wings but if you look at the pics they aren&#x27;t supposed to.</li>
            <li> This plates are great,especially for those who like to have their nails pretty.&lt;br /&gt;Is a set of 21 pieces,some designs are large enough to cover the whole nail.all&lt;br /&gt;it takes is the imagination.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t spent a lot of time using the plates, but after searching the many options out there these nail plates had the best combination of designs. I am really happy with the choices and can&#x27;t wait to use them more! My first attempt was pretty successful and am looking forward to using them on my daughters too!</li>
            <li> I love my new plates, I have many different designs to choose from.  I previously had the Konad plates, which are more expensive.  I actually like these Red Angel ones better because they are a little deeper and I can use some regular nail polish with them (thicker is better but I don&#x27;t have to buy that expensive Konad polish all the time!)  The full designs fit my nails well, although my nails are quite small.  It is ok for my cousin, whose nails are large.  The designs didn&#x27;t quite cover her thumb, but we put a different flower design for her thumb.  I recommend this product to my friends!  Yes, the plates are a bit sharp in the back, so be careful.  I&#x27;m glad I haven&#x27;t cut myself yet, though!  I&#x27;m having tons of fun with all the design choices...probably less cutesy and more sophisticated than the shany ones.  Although the emoticons are kinda cute</li>
            <li> I love all of the different designs on the plates. They all show up really well and they&#x27;re so easy to use. I&#x27;ve never used the Konad plates before and I wasn&#x27;t about to spend so much just for one plate. This is a great deal, especially for someone who is new to the nail stamping world.</li>
            <li> Good variety of designs &amp; good value. At the mall they sell plates for $7 each, so this is a good deal. I wish we could pick-n-choose what plates are in the set, but that&#x27;s the only drawback.</li>
            <li> These plates arrived very quickly.  One plate was not the right one, but their customer service quickly resolved the matter without any hassle.  The plates are very nicely etched, and stamp great.  Great value for the price.  I have purchased some as gifts for family members as well.  I&#x27;m very happy with the product and the customer service response.</li>
            <li> There was an early version of these plates where some of the fairies were missing their wings, however I got the later, corrected version.  So far all the designs I&#x27;ve used have stamped cleanly, and they have great original designs.  I&#x27;m quite pleased and hope they come out with another set.</li>
            <li> This is the worst product ever. It is quite frustrating to get the images to work. I regret purchasing these plates.</li>
            <li> Sent to me very fast.  I havn&#x27;t tried them yet but they look great and such a wonderful price for what I got.</li>
            <li> I received the Red Angel stamping plates with mixed expectations. For a cheaper set of plates, I was worried that the images on the plates would be very shallow and difficult to use. To my pleasant surprise, most of the images are deeply etched, transfer well, and are a nice size! The full nail images cover all but my thumb nail completely and I have wide nail beds. The price on these plates is great, and there is a lovely assortment of full nail images and some smaller single images to play with. The edges on the plates can be sharp, but I haven&#x27;t modified my plates in any way yet (felt backing, sanding the edges, etc) and I haven&#x27;t cut myself on them yet. I use them on top of a napkin and that keeps the free edges from being an issue. Love the little plastic storage case, it&#x27;s a little flimsy, but has stood up to the sharp edged plates so far, and it&#x27;s great to have something provided to store/organize the plates in. Pick yourself up a Konad double sided stamper and use an old gift card/credit card as a scraper, the metal edged scrapers WILL scratch the plates (found this out for myself). This set is a perfect starter set for someone who isn&#x27;t sure if they want to invest in the larger Bundle Monster or Konad sets, and will give you the practice you need to get good at nail stamping without breaking the bank. Keep an eye out for free shipping on these plates, it seems to come and go, but it&#x27;s a particularly great deal if they&#x27;re offering free shipping. Love this!</li>
            <li> the images are cut too deep a lot of the images get smeared and they snag when u try to clean them so little hairs always get stuck, my fairy images have no wings so they look like strippers. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> These plates are amazing. I love their new and funky designs. It&#x27;s not your typical flower design (though there are some of those). The majority of the patterns aren&#x27;t dupes of Konad or Bundle Monster, which is refreshing. I used the plates, and they have no problem with complete coverage and picking up the entire design. Sometimes it seems that the engraving isn&#x27;t deep enough to transfer the entire design, but these don&#x27;t have that problem.  I highly recommend these for their price and uniqueness. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!   If this is your first set of stamping plates, be sure you also order a stamper and scraper (though an old gift card works just as well) as these are not included.</li>
            <li> These plates are a joy to work with. I found them easy to use, and worked well with ordinary nail polish in many cases. These are a great value for those who are new to nail stamping like me.</li>
            <li> The Red Angel Plates that I purchased from this seller stamp great.  I only have three comments,   1)I was sent an extra plate. I&#x27;m not complaining, I was just confused at first when I opened it and thought I was missing one when I realized I just had an extra.  2) The Fairies on the image plates do not have wings. so they basically look like naked women. I will just use butterfly wings that I have on other plates to make them look like fairies, but the wings on the Fairies were not etched into the plate.  3) I was sent 2 wrong plates in my set, but they quickly replaced them.    Overall I think that it is a good deal for image plates, and has very unique designs separate from other image plates from Konad or Bundle Monster.  The images on the plates are unique, and for $16 including shipping is a great deal for 21 plates.</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with my stamp plates. Like the other reviews stated, they are very sharp around the ends and can be dangerous if you are not careful. Because i red the reviews before purchasing, i was aware of the sharp edges so i was careful. I have tried every single design as soon as I got in the mail (which by the way was SUPER fast) and they all stamp on with no problem! I will def order from this buyer again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;to see my nail art follow me on instagram ---&gt; kanikk</li>
            <li> Love the designs, size and price of these plates. The edges are sharp so be careful. If a second set becomes available I would buy it.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I got my new red angel plates, I tried them out right away and after much trial and error finally got it right. They work awesome no complaints here. One of my fairies is missing her wings but I&#x27;m not worried about it. Don&#x27;t listen to all the negative reviews this is a good way to get started. This was my first set and now I&#x27;m hooked I&#x27;m definitely going to buy more!</li>
            <li> Good product, with plenty of pictures, just have a lot of creativity. Too bad not to have protection on the back of each card ... Besides a product to buy, no doubt ...</li>
            <li> This set is very good works just as well (if not better) as the more expensive plates. Some of the patterned designs aren&#x27;t fully stamped out but overall great product</li>
            <li> I love my Red Angel nail plates! They have so many designs you won&#x27;t find on other brand&#x27;s plates. Red Angel Rocks!</li>
            <li> the images transfer nicely. there are lots of images to choose from, and the shipping was super fast! i look forward to more plates in the future</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be giving a 5 star review if I wasn&#x27;t scared of the edges of these plates. I&#x27;m not very good at the stamping yet, but the practicing I did on paper had nice clean lines. I didn&#x27;t see any issues with the etching on the stamps, none looked too shallow.</li>
            <li> I saw these plates on a blog I regularly read and I immediately ordered them! They came fast and I tried them that night. I was pleased with them they transfer on great. I was getting tired of using the same ole Monster Bundle ones and some of my usual Konad ones too. Def a great buy!</li>
            <li> Awesome designs! I was very impressed, although I will say that the edges of the plates are a little sharp! Overall awesome though!!!!</li>
            <li> Cute designs.  Love these only a few designs are not deep enough.  Great addition to my collection. Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> Very good quality. I was very pleased with the quality and the outcome of the designs. Red Angel should come out with a second collection of nail plates.</li>
            <li> I really like these stamp plates, my clients love the detailed fun designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have fresh designs and are etched deeply. The deep etching helps make the design bolder. Other plates I use I scrape lightly as I want to leave as much polish as possible for the transfer and I press more firmly to transfer. These plates I scrape with a little more pressure depending on design and press lightly for transfer as they hold more paint and if you press to hard they smudge. The deep etching allows for time for placement [not as much problem with polish drying on stamp] and a bold imprint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The full nail designs are larger which works well longer nails. If you have small nails you can use a remover pen, you can also use nail extension forms around nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wipe plate with acetone before first use then as needed to keep design clean and concise. The plates are ruff due to deep etching and cotton fiber sticks to etching. This must be removed after cleaning use a cloth as you do not want fiber in your polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful about edges this is my 3rd purchase of plates, this one does not have a backing. I cut myself twice while trying to remove the film on the first plate I used with this set. Never had this issue when plates have backing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to nail art and don&#x27;t have a lot of cash to be spending on expensive things that may or may not work.  So when I was looking for some new image plates, I needed to spend as little as possible but still get a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Red Angel \\&quot;nailed\\&quot; it!  I bought these based on the other positive feedback I&#x27;d read and I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with these plates!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product! I am definitely recommending them to my website visitors!</li>
            <li> These plates are incredible!! I used them using both Konad polish and regular polish and they both work fantastic!!! I love them!</li>
            <li> This plate set is wonderful! The designs are all unique and fun and original to Red Angel. I didn&#x27;t have any real quality problems. These plates do not stamp QUITE as crisp as Konad but one can only tell under close scrutiny that their crispness is not up to Konad standards. The full nail images are of a good size, comparable with Konad and the second Bundle Monster set.</li>
            <li> Someone I knew on Facebook got these and told me about them so I got a set, I have only used a few designs, but I really like these plates so far. I wish I would have ordered a second set to give as a Christmas present. The designs are really different for example the snowflake is more detailed than other dupe brands, I  even think a lot of them are even cooler looking than the real Konad ones, and they seem nicer than other dupe brands. I like them a lot.</li>
            <li> Product works great. I added paper backing to the plates to fit my preference. Lots of neat designs, and variety.</li>
            <li> These nail art plates are great better than konad because they are engraved deeper so you get a good transfer of the image.  I&#x27;m just waiting for someone too do a complete holiday collection because I don&#x27;t want to buy each one separately.</li>
            <li> These plates work really well.  I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with the designs picking up, like some of the other plates.  They also did not duplicate any other plates that I already had.</li>
            <li> These plates are awesome, and have really unique but cool designs on the plates. I am already frothing at the mouth for more!  Definately a good investment.</li>
            <li> Just received my new Red Angel nail stamp plates, and I am very excited to try them out. As a first time nail stamp user, I can&#x27;t wait to see how these cool designs work. The plates came exactly as shown, and were shipped out very quickly. So far I am very satisfied with this purchase, and I am sure I won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought my nail plates and they aren&#x27;t supposed to be here til the 30th but today is the 28th and they are already here. I love the little package they come in. I have the bundle monster sets that do not come in a package and it&#x27;s a mess. I was so pleased to see a labeled package to keep my plates in. The images on all of the plates are crisp and unique. I cannot wait to start using them. My only issue with these plates is the same as the original BM Plates, the sharp edges. I worry about cutting my fingers on the edges. Other than that I&#x27;m beyond pleased with the super fast shipping and quality of the plates. Thank you!</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;ve had this set for some time and the only images I use any more are the small ones. I guess I keep my nails a little longer thean I did when I wrote my first review, so the full designs don&#x27;t cover all my nails. i&#x27;ve never had and image stamping issues though, I just wish the images were bigger</li>
            <li> I gave four stars because I would really like them to have a backing! but otherwise super cute images. I have not tried them to stamp yet, but i cant wait to do so</li>
            <li> The designs are different from the others I&#x27;ve seen - more artistic and original.  The plates are deep enough to get great prints from them. My only issue with these are that they have VERY SHARP edges - much sharper than other brand plates. My 9 year old put a nice slice in her hand when she was using these and it bled like crazy and gave me a good scare.  I would absolutely recommend the plates based on the print quality and original designs - they&#x27;re great!  Just be careful when handling them.</li>
            <li> The designs are super cute, but the edges of the round disks are razor sharp!  I have to be very careful when looking through the plates so as to not cut myself - other than that, I enjoy them.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Patterns are so nice and you can create stylish nail art. They stamp really good no problem. Edges if paletts are a but to sharp.</li>
            <li> OMG I JUST RECEIVED THESE NAIL PLATES I LOVE ALL THE DESIGNS BUT I REALLY DONT LIKE THE FACT THAT THE EDGES ARE EXTREMELY SHARP WHEN I WAS PULLING THE PLASTIC OFF I ENDED UP CUTTING MY SELF YOU REALLY NEED TO PUT BACKING ON THEM I WOULDN&#x27;T REALLY RECOMMEND THESE TO PPL OVER ALL THEY DO HAVE CUTE DESIGNS ITS JUST THAT THERE A LIL DANGEROUS</li>
            <li> These are amazing. Just a bit tiny. The designs are to small for \\&quot;wider\\&quot; fingernails. All and all, I was impressed.</li>
            <li> I like these plates a lot. This was the first set I got after I tried the Salon Express kit.  They are pretty affordable.  I wish they had the backing like some of the others do, but if you handle them carefully you&#x27;ll be fine.  I really like the amount of full nail images in this kit and I like how different they are from most of the other sets available. These are definetly plates you have to experiment with in terms of how hard to scrape or press the stamper down but they work great once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> awesome images, different designs than just the average butterfly and flowers. no backing on the plates so be careful for sharp edges but otherwise images are clear and pick up well on stamper.</li>
            <li> the plates were protected with a blue plastic, thought they were scratched at first, but actually in pretty perfect condition from removable plastic cover. pleased with amount of all over nail designs. that&#x27;s exactly what i was looking for! can&#x27;t beat the price. other stamping designs look pretty big too compared to designs from other kind of plates i got. they&#x27;ll be more visible. got all the designs i wanted and more. beats paying 7 dollars for one plate!!! would love to buy from them again! sharper edges but can still handle them, but be extra careful! comes in one-pocket-storage. don&#x27;t know anything else to say but great!!!  p.s. i tried 5 designs and they came out well.</li>
            <li> These are my second set of plates I&#x27;ve ordered, I got the shany nail plates about 2 weeks ago. I LOVE STAMPING but if I had to pick which nail plates were better, I would definitely pick red angel plates, HANDS DOWN.  First of all the shany nail plates have a blue plastic film which is impossible to take off, the red angels come off so easily, I was impressed.  Second, the shany plates have sticky residue left from the plastic film while the red angel plates have a nice smooth surface.   And third, some shany plates are so difficult to get the design on the stamper, while the red angel is easier and have deeper cuts.  Overall, both plates are good for the price but definitely go with the red angel plates, I&#x27;m happy I got these! And note that both the shany and red angel dont have backpaper so they are sharp but its not a problem for me putting backpaper, just be extremely careful!! I wanted to get the bundle monster plates but after getting the red angel plates, I think I will stick with these because they&#x27;re a better price and they stamp beautifully!</li>
            <li> WOW, these are great quality. They stamp very well. the images are clear and the fine detail is great. You wont be disappointed with this set</li>
            <li> This is a great purchase, fast shipping and beautiful images that transfer nicely .  I just wish they had backing and that the full images and French tips were a bit wider. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I get clean lines and the impressions have all been very consistent.&lt;br /&gt;The designs are all the right depth, and so easy to use!&lt;br /&gt; Love these!!!!</li>
            <li> I love these stamping plates, I love the designs pretty different from some other brands. I can&#x27;t wait to see what is next with the Red Angel brand. I recommend them, great designs and great price, and yes they work wonderfully, what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> Stamping plates arrived very fast and all but one, RA110, works. I think that it&#x27;s not etched as deep as all of the others. I plan on asking the seller for a replacement because I really wanted that one. The other plates work very well (yes, I sat down and played with them all) and for the price I can&#x27;t complain!!!</li>
            <li> If you are into nail stamping these are a must have.  I have konad and bundle monster plates and these are mostly new designs not offered by either konad or bundle monster.  The only issue I saw was that they have no backing and could be rather sharp around the edges, so take care when handling them.  I highly recommend these for their price and uniqueness. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Red Angel have designs that I have not seen in any other collection of nail plate designs. I love it!</li>
            <li> I have ordered countless bundles of stamping plates and these by far are the best!! They are etched deep enough to get a rich colorful print! I can&#x27;t wait for more designs to come out!</li>
            <li> These stamps are great quality. They are a lot like the bundle monster plates. They have a lot of new designs that I have not seen before. Great full nail images. I have only had a problem stamping with a few of them, but when I try different polishes they do seem to do better. If you can get an image to stamp well I would suggest using Konad special polish. If it won&#x27;t stamp with that, then it just won&#x27;t stamp. I would say if you are looking to fill your collection with some plates it is a great buy. You get 21 plates for $11.99 as apposed to one Konad plate for $7, can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Items showed up in good condition and in just a few days. I am satisfied with this product. I am just learning to do the stamps and nail art so it will take some practice to get good, but I enjoy playing around with it!</li>
            <li> These plates work great. I have some Konad plates and these work just as well for a fraction of the price. I tried out images from almost every plate and they work GREAT! The only negative thing is that they are unfinished and have no backing so they are razor sharp. If you are super careful, it&#x27;s fine though. I haven&#x27;t cut myself on them. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> First I would like to start by saying, these came very quickly. So I was very happy with the seller. I received them three days after I ordered them. Second, they are VERY sharp. I have many other plates from other manufacturers that do not have backing, however, I cut my finger on one when I was removing the protective film. Be very careful. I wouldn&#x27;t give these to kids. If I was going to give plates to kids I would stick to the Bundle Monster plates. I haven&#x27;t actually stamped with them yet so I will come back and revise my review after I stamp with them, so I can let you guys know how well they transfer.   Now, I was disappointed in a few things. Plate RA-102 in the picture is not the same as the plate that I received, which disappointed me. The image in the top left corner which looks like snowflakes and Christmas ornaments was not on the plate. I was specifically looking for a Christmas themed stamp when I ordered these. Instead the image was the same as plate RA-107&#x27;s bottom left corner. I was also excited for plate RA-118 because of the snowflake for the same reason, however, there was not a snowflake on my plate and instead was just a generic looking flower. The image on my RA-107 plate in the bottom left corner was an amoeba looking stamp, similar to the stamp on RA-113 top left.  Plate RA-110 as shown in the product description shows the bottom middle stamp as a leaf looking stamp, however, mine has a stamp that looks like bubbles. Stamp RA-111 appears to have a fairly good size \\&quot;tinker bell\\&quot; stamp but in reality it is much smaller than the other four stamps on the plate.  The next stamp that disappointed the heck out of me was plate RA-112. My plate did not have the cool star pattern that is pictured in the description but instead has animal printy pattern.  On the RA-113 stamp in the description, the two bottom images that look like (argyle sweater and the sun) were not on my RA-113 stamp. Instead my RA-113 stamp had very small argyle pattern and another stamp that looked like bubbles. The argyle pattern on my stamp has small rows of diamond shapes. Seven across and eight down. It looks like the top image on the French plate 101. All in all, the set has a good variety of images, but since I didn&#x27;t get what I was really hoping for it reduces the amount of stars that I am going to give. Also, because of the razor sharp edges on these stamps. Every other plate company I have ordered from (Mash, Bundle Monster, and a generic plate company) have always been completely accurate with the pictures and descriptions.   I hope this helps. Happy stamping ladies.  Update: 12/12/2011.  I logged in yesterday to show my mom the discrepancy of the images on the product description and the actual plates I received, and it seems that after they read my review they updated the images on the description. So it appears that they show images that reflect the actual product now. It was too late for me but good for everyone in the future. I also used a few of the plates this weekend and they all seemed to transfer really well, so I am updating from 3 stars to 4. The missing star is because these plates are still extremely SHARP.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how well these were etched.  I had much better luck with designs stamping with the entire image fully covered with polish - I can physically feel the difference between these and my Bundle Monster plates when I run my fingertip over the designs.  I&#x27;m thinking, given other reviews, that it&#x27;s just luck of the draw whether or not yours take polish well or not.  Seems like etch quality is pretty random in ALL brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the designs more on these as well. Another reviewer called them whimsical, I believe, and that&#x27;s pretty apt.  There&#x27;s a number of heart themed ones as well as a couple that say &#x27;love&#x27; in various pretty ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are the edges sharp?  Yes, but there&#x27;s a simple way to avoid getting cut.  Don&#x27;t run your hands/fingers along the edges!  This really shouldn&#x27;t be something that would stop you from purchasing these lovely plates.  A little personal awareness and the problem is solved.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever done nail stamping, and these plates turned out pretty good.   Being my first time, I obviously need to get the hang of it and practice a bit, but that&#x27;s the same with all nail stamping plates.  After playing around and seeing what nail polishes stamped the best, I did my final designs and they look really good!   I have nothing to compare these plates to, but all I know is at this price they are wonderful! I&#x27;m not about to pay $7 per plate from konad. I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> I took a chance buying these plates after watching a review on youtube and looking at reviews on nail blogs.  They arrived with no backing, and a plastic coating which needed some care to remove because the edges are sharp.  Please  be careful.    Many of the designs are whimsical and while I was skeptical as to if the designs would transfer to my nails, the etching was iffy on some of the plates, they did so easily.  The square designs appear to cover barely cover my thumb but are perfect for my other fingers. If I have one complaint one lace design would have been nice.  If you are looking for a starter nail stamping kit Red Angel would be a good place to start.</li>
            <li> Love them !! The stamps come out nice and clean and sharp ! There are so many designs to choose from !</li>
            <li> fast shipping, just what i expected. great seller on amazon, would definitely go back and order more. so happy that theres people seeling this hard to find product</li>
            <li> I too love this set, the designs are Awesome, New and fresh! I am a COMPLETE Nail junky and Soon to be nail tech :) For the price and quantity... its a great buy! For beginners if you have never used a stamping plate before, it does take time to master. I too have larger nail beds, so sometimes i do have to double stamp... but i have to do that with konad plates too. These Angel full stamp images are same size as a konad image. I hope they make more! Thank you for a GREAT buy!</li>
            <li> On first impression: As soon as I opened these plates I was in love! There are a couple of scratches on the plates from manufacturing, but this does not bother me as they will undoubtedly become scratched with constant use. The blue protective film was effective and easy to pull off. these plates have no backing, which would lead you to believe that they are sharp; I did not find this to be the case, I even ran the edges across the skin of my hands and didnt have any problems. The images were gorgeous and extremely detailed, and they are quite noticeably deeper-set than other brands. The designs are fun and new with excellent variety- this drew me to them from the get-go.  On using these plates: Let me start of by saying that they certainly did not disappoint. I thought that the deeper-set images would give and advantage when transferring, but in practicality, that means more polish, which means it doesnt dry as fast(could be a good thing or bad) and the volume of polish transferred made it easy for me to smudge the design. (Sometimes I apply too much pressure) To spite that (with a bit of adjusting my handling) the images transferred beautifully. I own Bundle Monster, Kaying(faux-nad), and now Red Angel plates. Red Angel was a perfect investment to my image plate collection, and I find that i use them much more than my other plates, if not for anything else, but for thier beauty. I highly recommend these plates to anyone in love with nail art, even the inexperienced nail-lover will get endless joy out of these. And for $13, can you really think of a reason why not?</li>
            <li> I really love the unique designs on these Red Angel plates.&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD NOT MIND PAYING A COUPLE OF BUCKS MORE TO ENSURE I WOULD NOT CUT MY SELF ON THE OVERLY SHARP EDGES.&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE MAKE THEM PAPER BACKED.&lt;br /&gt;I had one plate not transfer at all and the company is sending the replacement.&lt;br /&gt;Good customer service.&lt;br /&gt;Having read the reviews about the edges, right out of the box I took a nail file and dulled the edges as best I could.&lt;br /&gt;While better then before they are still ridiculously sharp.&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing in the description warning people they are so sharp and could be cut....&lt;br /&gt;There is zero reason this company should be selling this with out being paper backed.&lt;br /&gt;Please think of your customers safety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~UPDATE 1/31/2012~~~&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THE REPLACEMENT PLATE AS PROMISED AND A RESPONSE BACK FROM MY INITIAL EMAIL STATING THIS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From: JMGlobal - Amazon Marketplace &amp;lt;7lh3qldk17fs5mj@marketplace.amazon.com&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sent: Saturday, January 28, 2012&lt;br /&gt;Subject: RE: Product details inquiry from Amazon customer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are sorry about the problem. We will implement paper back for our next new batch. We are already aware of this situation. Thank you for your input.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we will have to wait and see. Happy stamping!</li>
            <li> Just became obsessed with stamping and have been buying different stamps to see what works.  Had just bought the Bundle Monsters because they had a backing on the back of the plates.  Not a good reason.  They were really hard to work with.  Need a lot of practice on them.  A lot of their designs are not deep enough.  The Red Angel ones are great.  Have been watching YouTube, so I knew they would be sharp without a backing, but fixed that by filing them down with the coarse end of a nail file.  They work amazing.  So far everything I have tried to stamp with them, stamps easily and the first time.  The designs are great!  I would&#x27;ve given 5 stars, but some of my fairy&#x27;s were missing wings (I won&#x27;t use the fairy&#x27;s anyway), and a crown image was stamped wrong, but I probably won&#x27;t use it anyway.  Great buy and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these plates for about 2 weeks now &amp; can not quit using them, I LOVE THEM!!!  The designs are great &amp; they work very well, I was very impressed w/ how good they are for the price!  If your looking for an A+ product @ a low price these plates are the answer!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Plus great price, havent used them yet, but cant wait to try them out. Plates look very professional and durable</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am a little disappointed with the size of the full nail stamp.  I was hoping that they would be larger than the standard but they are not. Not sure why everyone including konad thinks that we all have short narrow nails.  Having said that I am pretty happy with the purchase overall.  For the price they are a good buy.  The designs are cute and I am especially happy with the happy faces.  These have no backing on them so they are sharp.  I have not stamped with these yet but just from what I have seen on blogs and from my inspection of the plates they all look to be cleanly engraved and deep enough that the polish wont scrap out.  The blue plastic was easy to remove much to my delight.    I think these would make a nice addition to any collection and lets hope that this manufacture will listen to demands and make plate images BIGGER! I own konad, both bundle monster sets, Chez Delaney,  and Mash.</li>
            <li> Not much success stamping the designs, but I have only tried a few. Product was shipped in a timely manner and in good condition. I hope that with more experience I can get better images, but right now I don&#x27;t know if it is me or the product.  I will try to update after using the product more.  I have had success with other plates.  Ie. Konad, Mash, Salon Express.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I have gotten better, but some of these plates are not etched well There is on plate that is etched way to deeply.  Of the ones that are etched OK I can easily make beautiful designs.  I am not changing my rating because I realized that a lot of these plates were just bad.</li>
            <li> i love my red angel plates, use them all the time. the edges are sharp so be careful, i did cut myself a few times just by looking through them, but i put a sticky back foam paper on the back of them and it didn&#x27;t make them sharp anymore. When my plates came in some of them were scratched. But i contacted the seller and they told me they would replace them for free.  i would definitely recommend this product if you love stamping!</li>
            <li> This was my first step of stamping plates and I really like them! The variety of designs are good and work well. Shipping was fast as well.</li>
            <li> They are just fine I bought them for my daughter she already had the monster bundle . So once I seen the review on the Red Angel plates on u tube. I had to purchase these for my little Diva! Thanks a lot</li>
            <li> Las plaquitas me han llegado en dos semanas y son estupendas. Tienen buen precio, los dibujos son preciosos y estampan super bien.  Me encantaría que los diseños de uña completa fuesen un poco mas grandes para poder cubrir de una sola vez la uña del pulgar.  Ojo! Hay que tener mucho cuidado con los bordes afilados.  Recomiendo el producto y estoy deseando el siguiente conjunto de placas. Gracias</li>
            <li> I was excited to get my Red Angle Nail Art plates and I loved the varity of designs. I can&#x27;t wait to try them.</li>
            <li> A couple of weeks ago, I received the Red Angel plates. They&#x27;re packed in a plastic baggie so you can store them together. Very nice!  I discovered 2 other plates than the Red Angel plates. I accidentally received two Shany-plates.  I mailed the seller about this little mixup and I immediately got an e-mail back with apologies and the note that they would send the two missing plates a.s.a.p.  A couple of days later I received the 2 missing plates.  I&#x27;m very happy with them and I think the communication with the seller was great.  This was a great deal. The engravement of te plates are great and the designs are also very beautiful!  Kim from The Netherlands</li>
            <li> Just got these and I can&#x27;t wait to try them.  All of the images look awesome and feel like they are deeply engraved.  I&#x27;ll post a more thorough review after I use them for the first time.</li>
            <li> I bought these because of the angel images, but when I received them I noticed they had no wings. I contacted the company and said there must be a defect with my plates, but they said they made some changes and the angels no longer have wings. So basically they turned what once where angels, into just plain whores. I&#x27;m really disappointed in their \\&quot;improvement\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I read a review for the Red Angel plates and had to have them. I have a few konads and both Bundle Monster sets, and the Red Angel plates had a lot of unique designs (and lots of full nail designs that i prefer). The designs are large and there is no problem covering the whole nail (unlike BM series 1)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are few flowery designs which are great and a large diamond (harlequin) style design which is good because that was always a design i loved on the BM Plate but it was too small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The metal of the plates feel of cheap, lower quality but it hasn&#x27;t effected the stamping process, they just don&#x27;t seem as strong as the BM or Konad plates&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for the price, there is a good variety of patterns that are unique and not found in other plate systems. I think they are worth it!</li>
            <li> I thought product I was receiving was images in pictures taken by other customers. Not so, but I feel ok about purchase based on price paid for the amount of plates. I have used three images so far and have found that one of them doesn&#x27;t work. Even so I am happy with this purchase. The shipment came very fast. I hope that the more I use the plates the happier I will become overall with this purchase. I would do business with seller again, but would probably ask for better pictures of product I&#x27;m buying before making my purchase.</li>
            <li> These plates are slightly sharp on the edges, but we have not had any cuts from them.  They are etched deeply for each design and stamp beautifully.  Definitely good quality.  I would purchase from them again.  I would like to see some plates with only one design on it, but with different sizes of that same design to fit onto different size nails (ie: big toe and littlest toe).  As with any of the plates, they work best with thick polish.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the designs and depth of the designs on the plates. Just as others have said the only down side is the sharpness of the plates.  Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> These stamp plates designs are beautiful. The plates are sturdy and easy to use. Changing your nail design is easy and fun.</li>
            <li> These came nicely packaged in a little soft plastic envelope and while I haven&#x27;t tried all the plates yet, the few designs I tested worked just fine. These are a great price and a great addition to my Konad supplies.</li>
            <li> The plates work well, but not of them all are my style. They all work with the konad scraper and stamp.</li>
            <li> I love these stamping plates!  Lots of full nail patterns to chose from.  Images are the same size as the Konads, but they are more deeply and intracately engraved.  Transfers beautifully.  Use some sandpaper to dull sharp edges.  Would definately order the Red Angel brand again.</li>
            <li> I love this set, the plates are great, new designs that are fresh and fun! They arrived very quickly and I haven&#x27;t put them down!! Would definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I tried the plate right after I received, and I did not really like them. The cut on the plate is too deep, so the images are thick and smear on the nail when I stamp it.</li>
            <li> Received the plates. Very fast shipping it was everything I expected. I love the designs especially the smiley faces. They worked well with the stamp. Images are clear.</li>
            <li> These plate images were fantastic for the price!  The ones I&#x27;ve tried stamped well.  The edges are sharp, so do be careful...my little boy cut his finger when he was helping me peel off the blue protective film.  There are some cute images, and the full nail images are large enough for my thumb.  I&#x27;m happy with my Red Angel plates!</li>
            <li> To rate this, I want to hear back from JMGlobal. 6 of my plates are damaged with either pock marks near the designs or huge scratches running through the plates. If they will replace the damaged plates I will give them an excellent rating.&lt;br /&gt;P.S.&lt;br /&gt;They immediately responded to my email and are going to replace 3 of the worst plates! Very impressive.&lt;br /&gt;Now to wait for the plates!</li>
            <li> i got this  plates 1 month ago and i love them. the only thing that i believe is important to say is that they are too sharp.. i cut myself trying to take off the protection wrap. ohh and some of the dessigns are kind of too small for my nail. other that that they are great.!!</li>
            <li> A favor:  Me encantan, son muy baratas, los dibujos son preciosos y estampan bien.  En contra:  Tienen bordes afilados, una placa me ha llegado defectuosa, está mal grabada.  Me las volvería a comprar? si, me encantan sus diseños.</li>
            <li> you will love them. they are great you get so many different ones you will have so much fun with them</li>
            <li> These are great. The designs are creative and have lots of variety. They aren&#x27;t the usual designs that you see. This is going to be so much fun.  I am really happy I got this. They are beautiful.</li>
            <li> Different images from the other popular brands.  Stamps clear images for the most part.  Could use a paper backing to protect fingers from the sharp edge; but isn&#x27;t a problem if you are careful.  I get compliments all the time.  People always ask how I&#x27;m able to get such intricate designs myself.</li>
            <li> These image plates have great images.  If all of the plates worked, this would be my favorite image plate set.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried each image on these nail plates, and have found that on 7 of the plates, the images are etched too deeply.  The plate is not usable because of this.  When I try to use any of the images on these 7 plates, due to the deep etching too much polish is left after scraping and then too much polish is picked up on the stamper.  When stamped on the nail, it just looks like a smeared mess.&lt;br /&gt;The plates that are not usable are:&lt;br /&gt;RA101, RA103, RA104, RA106, RA107, RA114, and RA120.&lt;br /&gt;I tried contacting the company about the defective plates, but did not receive a reply.</li>
            <li> I had seen a review on these plates on youtube and I knew that I wanted to get them. When they arrived I fell in love with all the images. Totally impressed with this product.If they make another set I would definately purchase them.</li>
            <li> Very original designs on those plates, no exact dupes of Konad or bundle monster plates.... And at a good price.  The designs are large enough for my nails.  I&#x27;m really happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> My husband purchased this product for me and I absolutely love the designs on the plates, the designs pick up easy on your stamper with any kind of polish. The designs are like none that I have seen so far that is one of the factors that led me to have my husband purchase the set for me. They come in a small plastic holder which can be kept to keep the plates in if you so desire unlike bundle monster or kondad. The only complaint I have about them is that the edges are very sharp. They have no backing to them like bundle monster or konad and they can cut you if you&#x27;re not careful pulling the blue plastic off before using.  Great product for the price, also speedy delivery as well. Over all very very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I just received my Red Angel plates in the mail! They have great designs and I am thrilled with the value. The price was fantastic for the number of plates I received! I am also VERY pleased with how quickly they came in the mail! I will certainly purchase items from them in the future!</li>
            <li> Wonderful selection of images that aren&#x27;t too floral or too cute. Different from Konad and BundleMonster so there is no over-lap in design selection. A great set to have!</li>
            <li> I just received these plates. I am new to nail stamping and purchased these plates to begin my collection. I did a LOT of research before I purchased these plates. I felt like these plates had the designs I was looking for and other than being VERY sharp, as I&#x27;ve read most plates are ( I just cut up some old cereal boxes and glued them to the back of the plates to prevent injury),  I am happy with the designs and how well the plates work. Of course there are designs I will never use on my own nails, but I think I will eventually use most of the designs, which makes me believe this was a worthwhile purchase. I have had no issue picking up the entire design because they are well etched into the plates. This being my first experience with nail stamping plates, I am very satisfied and encouraged to continue on in my new found hobby of nail art!</li>
            <li> it was sent quick and i received it quick i loved the product i couldnt bleive how great the product was and how easy it was to use it</li>
            <li> These plates don&#x27;t stamp we&#x27;ll at all. I have tried several different things and still not good. I really want my money back.&lt;br /&gt;I have stamping plates from a few other companies and these are the worse.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping. Overall, these are very good plates. Crisp, clear stamps, with a few exceptions. On a couple of the plates there are deep scratches, but only 2 designs are affected, and I didn&#x27;t care for those particular ones anyway. The fairy and a few others blur, which is why 4 stars. But for the price, these exceed my expectations. I am impressed with the overall function and value. Most designs stamp perfectly. And the designs are not rehashed Konad designs, which is nice. At this price, the amount of designs, plates and possibilities are awesome. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It looks great, it has a great price,  you will love it. my darling daughter  loves it so much! Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I love these and I must say that they are better than the Konad stamping plates. The designs seem to be more defined and it makes for very pretty nails.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these nail plate designs, it an absolute must have product. I had a wonderful ordering experience and the plates arrived in a very timely manner. 5 stars!!!</li>
            <li> My experience with previous nail stamping kits (I have not used Konad yet) has been that some of the designs are not deep enough and do not stamp well. However, with this kit, I have had minimal problems with getting images to stamp and the images come out crisp. It includes a nice variety of designs for a great price.&lt;br /&gt;While some of the whole nail designs are smaller they do cover the majority of the fingernails. They do come with a blue film which needs to be peeled off and the kit does not include a scraper or stamp which need to be bought separately. The plates are a little on the thin side so I put my own backing on them to make them more comfortable to hold. These are definitely my go to when it comes to stamping and I get tons of compliments.</li>
            <li> I really love these plates. They came with so many different designs and all seem very unique. They are easy to use and clean. Even my sister in laws are comming to borrow my Red Angels. Wonderful product. Can&#x27;t wait for the next new idea from them.</li>
            <li> I was concerned buying a cheaper (compared to Konad) set of plates since I&#x27;ve had several I&#x27;ve bought off amazon that were not stampable or in some cases the plates just weren&#x27;t clear when stamped, but I&#x27;m pleased with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: we need paper backing on these. You will straight slice yourself open on these. I&#x27;m willing to pay a few more bucks for that. Most people are. You feel like you&#x27;ll cut yourself on these and in fact I did. What&#x27;s a little blood for cute nails though?  The full nail designs need to be BIGGER. I can never cover a full thumb with most of the etched designs...look at all that extra space you have on the template surface and help a girl out. :) Just increase them. Go find a dude with decent sized nails and throw some patterns in that would cover HIS nails. That way us girls would be covered. Plus, I&#x27;d like to do my toenails sometime in one stamp and that will never happen with these little ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: cost, designs are cute (especially the smilies) I&#x27;ve only tried a few...but the designs are etched deep enough on most plates I think that they will all stamp okay. One had too much etched space and didn&#x27;t stamp well (you know when you have a huge area and the stamp bottoms out and the stamp ends up splotchy) and one looks too light. MOST are awesome so great job! The designs are original...not just copies of other plates (which is why I bought them even though I have more plates than I could possibly need :O) ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes. THESE PLATES ARE A GOOD BUY. :) You&#x27;ll be happy with them.</li>
            <li> This collection of plates certainly is not disappointing.  There are so many interesting designs to choose from, I know that I will not be bored with my nails for quite some time.  There definitely are a handful of designs that I would not have purchased individually, such as the one with the emoticons.  Also, personally, I don&#x27;t have many polishes that are best for stamping.  I have a vast collection of nail polish, but the majority of it doesn&#x27;t hold well when it comes to stamping.  It seems like a lot of the patterns bring out the color of the polish being stamped rather than the one underneath.  I would like to have a set of stamping patterns that focuses on the base color.  If you have a wide selection of colors that are stampable, then this set is fantastic; it still is wonderful without.  The two floral patterns on RA-109 are my favorite.</li>
            <li> I was extremely happy with my purchase of the Red Angel Nail Stamping Plates. I couldn&#x27;t believe how many different designs, and how many plates I was able to receive for such a reasonable price. They work GREAT, and make doing and changing my nail art designs super easy!!! I would definitely tell a friend about it.</li>
            <li> I received my stamping plates exactly as advertised, they look great.  No scratches or dents.  I&#x27;ve already used one plate for my nails and it was perfect!</li>
            <li> Red angel This product come damage and scratcher every plates. One plate come  very damage no image in the plates  Bad products</li>
            <li> I am working on my Konad collection, but wanted something to hold me over until I get more Konad plates. So I ordered these cause the price was right and it had good reviews! I tested these yesterday on paper and on some artificial nails (since I had just did my own nails :P).&lt;br /&gt;I had to work really fast for the image to come out right. When I use my Konad plates I usually have time to double check the image and make sure I position it on the nail exactly where I want it. These seem to not be engraved as deep as the Konad plates, so the polish is thinner on the stamp and therefore dry&#x27;s faster!&lt;br /&gt;I used all Konad polishes, and the images came out ok. If I was to slow it would only transfer half the image and the other half was dried on my stamp, but if I was really fast it worked perfectly. There was one on RA-113 that did not work at all no matter how fast I worked, it was the image of the girl.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, these are great for the price, most of them work if you are fast enough :P. They will definitely get the job done until I expand my Konad collection.&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest to test the image you want to use on a piece of paper or a fake nail before using it on your nail, just to be sure it will stamp correct and to get a feeling how fast you have to be. ;)&lt;br /&gt;I also found the protective plastic to peel off the plates very easy!!! :)</li>
            <li> I love the designs but some of them don&#x27;t come transfer to the rubber applicator.  I say about half don&#x27;t work as well but I still use the set all the time with the ones that transfer properly.</li>
            <li> Sharp edges, they could use some paper backings. Nice designs, they look pretty shallow but I haven&#x27;t had any issues picking up the images.</li>
            <li> Some images are good and transfer well but the plates are made of cheap metals so I see some rusty stain already.&lt;br /&gt;what can I say, they are cheap.&lt;br /&gt;I like these in general.</li>
            <li> This is a great collection with lots of different designs. I bought this one because it had more full nail designs than the others. The plates may have worked better with the konad polish or a polish meant for stamping. They still did good, I just wish they were a little deeper set so you could pick up more polish.</li>
            <li> I bought these and the images don&#x27;t transfer to well. It may be the Konad stamping pad I bought for it is faulty, so don&#x27;t discard them, but make sure to buy a different stamping pad to go with these plates.</li>
            <li> Some of the full nail sized images are too shallow to pick up will and transfer completely across the nail- although the perfect polish may help remedy that.  It did seem some were more shallow than others when I was stamping different ones all w/the same polish.&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful designs &amp; you will get an awesome mani!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get used to using these if you have never used them before, you have to be quick before the polish dries though, but they are fun to play with. The tip designs don&#x27;t fit on my thumbs, but I must have larger thumb nails than most average women.  I am enjoying playing around with using different color combinations to see what shows up on top of what colors.</li>
            <li> The designs are alright the plates are etched well and stamp well they do come with paper backing and plastic peel off cover to keep them from getting damaged in transit.</li>
            <li> I had read other reviews and knew to watch for the sharp edges, but was surprised when I opened it up and every plate had a backing on it. I love these plates and the images. Every one I&#x27;ve tried has been flawless.</li>
            <li> Not all the plates work very well, they are not deep enough, so the stamping is very light.</li>
            <li> love the RA plates but if only the plates have paper backing just so the edges of the plate won&#x27;t be that sharp, plus there are two plates that had scraches on them but thank God that didn&#x27;t ruin the images!! i&#x27;m looking forward to the next set of plates *wink wink*</li>
            <li> I bought these because I found that I really liked nail stamping, I wanted new designs....AND The first set of plates (MASH) that I bought, had small full nail designs. This seemed to fit the bill, the reviews were good, and some review videos left me hopeful. Thankfully they were almost exactly what I expected. The full nail designs are large enough to go way over my thumbs. They are etched very deeply as well which is good....The only \\&quot;con\\&quot; is that there is no paper backing which makes them sharp, and makes the blue film a pain to take off...I just re-positioned the blue film from the front to the back so they are safer to handle....Also, because they are etched deeply, they are a pain to clean with cotton or q-tips, or anything that leaves lint or can snag...because it will...so I plan to get lint free cloths to use....These two negatives don&#x27;t take away from the review though, because overall they are better than the MASH plates IMO, but even the MASH plates are really good. All of my colors (I don&#x27;t use konad polishes) pick up really well, and for $15 it really can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> These images transfer very well. I love all of the designs, but my favorite it the ones with the bubbles :) I have the konad stamper and some konad plates and I think these work just as well. I couldnt really point out any flaws in these plates!</li>
            <li> I ordered these to go with my konad, mash, etc. plates and was expecting them to be sharper on the edges based on other reviews. They are, but it&#x27;s nothing that 10 seconds with a nail file won&#x27;t fix so it&#x27;s not an issue, or certainly shouldn&#x27;t be imo. The shipping was VERY fast! I had a small problem with 4 of my plates being gouged badly and emailed the company. They responded 6 minutes later! They remedied the problem immediately and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the plates. They are a bit thinner and not etched quite as deep so you have to make sure you scrape well but the images are beautiful and I can&#x27;t wait for new ones from this company! You can&#x27;t go wrong for the money here.</li>
            <li> I am new to the whole world of nail art, and being that I am not a free-hand artist by any means, I am addicted to these image plates! I have bought a few different sets of these from different companies and I would def rate these among the top 3! The designs are cut well and they go on perfectly! I am excited to have a new NOTD look every day. The only problem is trying to decide which design I want to use and what colors!</li>
            <li> Sweet new designs. Etched in well, and transfers great. I can&#x27;t complain at all, for this price, it&#x27;s even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All designs are like nothing I&#x27;ve seen on other plates. I only found two designs that can be considered as \\&quot;dupes\\&quot;, but aside from that, everything else is amazing.</li>
            <li> I received my red angel plates a few days ago and decided to try out a few stamps before making my review.  the very first thing i noticed was the sharp edges. i thought the blogs and reviews i read were exagerating, but they truly are sharp. how sharp, you ask?.. last night, i was peeling the blue plastic cover off a plate and ended up cutting my finger. it drew blood for a little bit, and today, the cut is making it uncomfortable to type. so BEWARE!!.. sharp edges are true!  next, as i looked at the images, i saw lots of new designs that i haven&#x27;t seen before. the drawback though, is that some of the images were too deep. i used keankolor, opi, china glaze and the konad specialty polish, which all scraped off pretty well.. but once you take your stamper to get the image, the color splatters out because the images were cut so deep, that when you try to transfer it, the entire image is blotted and completely distorted. also, because the images were cut deep, it made it a little more difficult to clean them out, and like the edge of the plates, the images also have a similar sharp edge, so you&#x27;ll have some small shreds of cotton in the picture that you&#x27;ll need to go back over to remove.  i don&#x27;t have an image plate holder, so i would suggest you do what i do: put the plate over a rag or paper towel, as the edges aren&#x27;t too smooth and can cause you to scratch the surface you have it on.  overall, about 2/3 of the plates i got are use-able and i really do like the images. this is still a great value (even with shipping cost), and i would still recommend it to friends, although i can not express this enough: please take caution with the sharp edges, as it is not an exaggeration. even if you&#x27;re careful, it only takes one moment for it to slip your grip, and before you know it, you&#x27;ve already cut yourself.</li>
            <li> These are very good image plates to make so many beautiful nail arts. This set is one of my favorite image plates.</li>
            <li> I ordered these just because I liked some of the patterns, but did not expect them to work well. Boy was a happy when I found that they work better than the bundle monster plates I have. I think the images at etched deeper into the metal, so the pattern picks up better. The only thing I dont like are the sharp edges because they do not have the paper on the back, but this is easily fixed with a roll of the sticky paper used to line cabinets.</li>
            <li> Was very pleased when I started to peel the blue covering off. The detail and depth of etching is very good. I love the images, they are very wide in range of topics. Am very happy I took the chance on these. Would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> I received this product in a timely manner. At first I had a duplicate of #19 and missing #5. The seller was very accomadating. They sent me the missing #5 promptly. I only had to send an email and they responded really fast. Excellent customer service. :) Wonderful product, stamps out beautifully. The only issue like many of the customers has is that it doesn&#x27;t have a backing. The good thing is that I just bought contact paper and stuck it to the back, works perfectly!! :)</li>
            <li> These stamped okay and had nice designs.</li>
            <li> This is a great set of nail art plates. I have other name brands and just wanted to add to my collection of designs with this set. It came as promised and performs just as well as some of the other more expensive ones. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> Nice assortment of images but there are no real full size designs big enough for the average nail. My ten year old niece likes the designs, great for tiny nails.</li>
            <li> I received these for Valentine&#x27;s Day from my Husband and I truly Love them...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried each one and they all stamp extremely well...!!! :)&lt;br /&gt;My only down fall and complaint with them is the sides are sharp, they need some kind of backing on them...but for the price their still worth it and I Love the designs...over-all I&#x27;m happy with this product...</li>
            <li> Different designs from the others plates I have. They stamp great and I like the quality.  I love them.  I hope they keep coming out with new ones!</li>
            <li> I bought this item based off of a nail tutorial and am beyond pleased with the product and how fast they shipped this. Item was protected and sent in a few short days. Definitely looking forward to ordering more!</li>
            <li> These are very cheap compared to the Konad stamps.  I bought the Konad stamper and these stamp plates--lots of different designs to choose from, and they work just fine.  Love them!</li>
            <li> These plates are, to me, the best plates ever !&lt;br /&gt;The designs are so cute and a lot different from other plates we can find everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Too bas that JM Global never answer any emails, neither by amazon nor facebook.&lt;br /&gt;And they don&#x27;t want to ship outside the USA... what a shame...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, buy these plates, you won&#x27;t be disappointed ! I swear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And sorry for my english, I&#x27;m french.</li>
            <li> Love them so far, easy to use and love so many of the designs.&lt;br /&gt;Noticed though that I got a duplicate of one and was missing another.&lt;br /&gt;Great deal if you&#x27;re looking for a lot of designs for a small price.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and they now come backed with paper so ignore all the previous reviews about them being sharp and without a paper backing.  They also come with their own storage pouch.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how bad these plates turned out to be after reading all the good reviews. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get these plates because the full nail images are so beautiful. I have Konad and other non-Konad brands of image plates, and these are by far the worst ones. None of full nails images pick up the full design, and even if that wasn&#x27;t a problem, the full nail images are too narrow to cover the entire width of all the nails. A few of the small single item designs work okay, but not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The images on the plates are really rough and uneven. They don&#x27;t pick up the polish well, nor transfer it to the nail completely. Also, the edges are extremely uneven and will cause many little cuts on your fingers, as many others have mentioned in their reviews. That roughness is part of the problem with the images. You can just look at them at tell how uneven they are. Even though these are so cheap compared to the Konad plates, they are a total waste of money. Shany &amp; Bundle Monster work well, spend your money on those brands, if don&#x27;t want to pay the high price for Konad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, these plates seemed dirty when I got them. I cleaned them up well, but it didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li> If I could give zero stars for this set of stamping plates, I would have. I purchased these back in December and used them for the first and last time in February. The price was fair and they arrived quickly and that is all I can say that is positive. So, I suppose one star is merited, after all. The reason why I hate these plates is that they are so deeply etched that every image comes out smeary and totally without detail. I am so incredibly disappointed by these plates and wasn&#x27;t going to leave a review, at all. But I feel that other customers need to know what they may be getting, if they order these plates. A huge disappointment in shiny steel disks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is my sincere hope that Red Angel has solved this problem, by now.</li>
            <li> Most of the stamps stamp very well. Must make sure the paint you use is good enough. Consider getting the special polish. One inconvenience was that Red Angel only ships in the U.S.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait for this to come in the mail. Came before expected ship date and I was overly excited. I used most images and worked perfectly fine.&lt;br /&gt;TIP**** - Make sure to use nail polishes that are more opaque and thick (the cheaper nail polishes do the job well). ;)&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely order red angel nail plates again. :)</li>
            <li> I am in love with these image plate !! I wish I had gotten them sooner. The quality is great and the designs are siper cute ! So much better than Cheeky . Thank you for such a great product xoxo</li>
            <li> I was dissappointed by these plates.  After using many other stamping plate products, I believed these plates would be just as good.  However, I was not happy with them, after I tried to use them and found they did not work.  I am not sure if these plates are defective or what, but I would never order from this company again.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried any other plates other than the ones that came with my salon express. These work great n have cute detailed designs. I really recommend these.</li>
            <li> I ordered the plates a wednesday afternoon and got them on saturday. WOW! One of the plates was messed up so I contacted the seller and they sent me a replacement almost as quickly. The only thing was the set came with the backing on all plates but my replacement didnt. Not a biggie. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> i really like the selection that these plates offer. they are great quality and they had a pattern I couldn&#x27;t find anywhere else! gteat service too. I strongly reccomend this seller and product :)</li>
            <li> These are just about free and they&#x27;re the best stamping plate out there!!!! Each and every design is crispy and transfers well!! Not a single complain here!!! I will order the next set they come up with!!!</li>
            <li> Most of these designs are dupes of other brands.  The metal plates are quite thin and the edges are razor sharp.  I have very small nailbeds but some of these designs are too small even for me.  And the image quality isn&#x27;t that great.  For the one or two designs I enjoy using the rest of the product is a waste.</li>
            <li> This set of nail stamping plates is PERFECT! It has just the right amount of full-nail designs with a bit of small designs as well. **IGNORE PREVIOUS REVIEWS OF THE EDGES BEING EXTREMELY SHARP! RED ANGEL HAS FIXED THIS PROBLEM AND EACH PLATE COMES WITH A BACKING!** The designs on these plates are all new and unique. Most of these designs stamp crisply. This set is perfect and in-expensive!  These came in the mail quickly! None of my plates were scratched or damaged at all. I recieved exactly what I wanted! I will definately buy more of these to give as gifts to friends!</li>
            <li> I did a test with a couple of plates, and there aren&#x27;t deep enought so the images can be transfer to the nails, I really expect more of this product because of the reviews. Also the bag that contains the plates were damaged.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these stamps! So many options when it comes to my nails now! I would reccomend this to anyone new to stamping, some of the pictures could be engraved a little deeper to get all those details but overall these are very well made!</li>
            <li> I like this set, the designs are new &amp; fresh which is exciting because I have a slight obsession with nail stamping &amp; own many sets from different brands. To compare to some of the better brands this one is ok. Its worth the money but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for beginners because you have to know a few tricks to get optimum results. The patterns are set pretty deep which is good because you get a better transfer but they are so hard to clean it can be frustrating.   The images are awesome &amp; are large enough to cover all fingers including the thumb nail which is an issue with some other brands. The variety is great I even like that they change up the configuration of images from plate to plate.   Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase. Not the best but far from the worst. Happy Stamping!</li>
            <li> These designs are so unique and stamp very well. Shipping was beyond fast! I highly recommend for other nail stamping junkies like me. :-)</li>
            <li> I have a few Konad plates, that are around 6.99 each... these plates are just as good. Sometimes the designs aren&#x27;t etched deep enough and they have a bit of trouble transferring but I&#x27;ve been using these for a few weeks and they are still amazing. I love the designs. It shipped the next day and was delivered within 4 days. I would even go as far as to say that I like them better than Konad.</li>
            <li> I love the red angel stamping set....first off, i ordered mine on November 20th and received it November 23rd....fastest shipping i ever had purchasing over the net...so i was extreamly happy for that. The plates are great for the price. i have konad, bundle monster and some other one, and i really am glad i bought this one.  the images are diffrent from konad and bundle monster. the quality is really good for the price.</li>
            <li> This product is very good. I got the item and it was more than I expected. It was very nice and very neatly packaged. It was at a reasonable price for this type of product. Love it.</li>
            <li> These are awesome. I love having my nails look awesome every week!&lt;br /&gt;They can be a bit of a pain to clean and sometimes the designs. Don&#x27;t go onto the stamp completely.&lt;br /&gt;but over all a great product.</li>
            <li> When I got my 1st set of red angle they stamped great. they were a little thin but with this new set they fixed that. this images are great. They need some more hello kitty designs, breast cancer ribbons, an aunk and even a Celtic knot on the next set. I only buy Red Angle, MASH and now I&#x27;m going to try GALS. I think I&#x27;m addicted. lol. Keep the stamping plates coming Red Angle. THX</li>
            <li> Los diseños y la calidad de las placas son excelentes muy bonitas, ya los he probado y estoy muy contenta.</li>
            <li> The images were nice and clear, I had not problems with these plates.  There&#x27;s a great variety of images, and I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a set of plates that are a good price.</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;m disappointed I received my plates and they will not stamp I don&#x27;t no why they won&#x27;t stamp I&#x27;m gonna purchase another stamper hopefully it works</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used all of the images on the Red Angel plates, but the ones I&#x27;ve used stamped just as well as the far more expensive Konad plates. They come nicely packaged in a heavy plastic storage pouch. Each plate has a backing, and I was unable to find any sharp or rough edges on any of the plates. The images stamp crisp and clear with both regular and special Konad stamping polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem was that the full nail images were a bit on the small side. While I have long nail beds, I keep my nails fairly short. Even so, I had to be very careful to get the entire nail covered from cuticle to tip. Were my nails any longer, these image plates wouldn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small full-nail images are the only reason I wouldn&#x27;t give this product a 5-star rating. In all other ways, the quality and value are superb.</li>
            <li> I was researching these image plates for a gift, and I think that this set has the best quality and best value.  After seeing it work I ended up going back and buying a set for myself too!  The images on the plates are clear and they are easy to clean.  No complaints yet.</li>
            <li> I got this product for my girlfriend who does her own nails, she loved it.. it worked perfectly for her. she said its was easy to use and she has saved so much time and money by not having to go to the nail salon. she loves it..</li>
            <li> I received SEVERAL misprinted plates, a reversed plate and even a used plate. The company was nice enough to plate them, but those replacements were not much better. I still had issues with a few new ones and they have extremely sharp edges. When I commented on that to the seller I was told, well that was what the company sent us. There is no backing on the replacement plates as well. The full nail designs are micro so if you have long or wide nails, you&#x27;ll have to double stamp. I would NOT buy another set from them, talk about a waste of money</li>
            <li> Brought these plates for my first try with nail art stamping and they were great. So far, I have only tested about half of the designs in set and they all turned out crispy and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to nail stamping then some times the image issue might be due to the polish or the technique you are using. I did find out that if the polish is too thin, then the color would not be bright as it should be (ex: white polish will appears to be gray on a black background). Also, if you are too slow during removing the excess polish on the plates and stamping the design on to the stamper, then most of the time the design would not be fully transferred onto the stamper since some of the polish might be already dried. Of curse, the way you are stamping the design onto the stamper matters too. Although, it might sounds complicated but once you get the hang of it, it is quite easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plates are easy to handle and there wasn&#x27;t any sharp edges since there are paper backing for each of the plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did wish that there are some mirrored designs for the ones that have a direction. For example, the image of the phoenix is facing right. It would have been nice if i can have the phoenix facing right for one hand and the other hand have it facing left. However, that is just my preference.</li>
            <li> Great quality, great stamping, but designs are almost same size as Konad, very small for my nails, but it does have a great variety of designs, even a weed leaf hahaha&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> I own Konad, bundle monster, mash and winstonia, which all stamp great. I was expecting red angel to be of similar quality, but it wasn&#x27;t.  I watched video reviews on youtube about this red angel set and I was really impressed. However, when I received them, they appeared dirty looking and the etchings seemed really uneven. Sure enough, many of the images had missing areas when transferred. For example, the cow print image had missing holes within the print, not cute looking at all. I am an experienced stamper, I also used the konad special polish (which gives you more optimal results) but still no success. I don&#x27;t even want to include this set in my binder that I organize my plates in. Don&#x27;t waste your money, I know the designs are super cute, but you won&#x27;t be satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> This is the first collection I purchased after I saw a review on YouTube. This is such a deal (or a steal) for the fact that the Konad plates are more pricey just for 1. Here you&#x27;re getting all these plates for a good price. The designs are very pretty; the full nail designs do seem a bit small but workable.</li>
            <li> Bought this along with the Konad starter kit and I am very happy.  Quality seems good and you get a lot of plates for the $$</li>
            <li> These plates are great, with only one drawback. The images are clear and a good size. Some could be bigger, but for the most part, they fit my nails and my they&#x27;re not too big for my daughter. My only con with these plates is there is no protective backing. These plates (like all the others) are VERY sharp so they need some sort of backing. I&#x27;m going to make my own for this set, but it would definitely improve the plates if they came with it.  All in all, for the price I am VERY pleased with these plates and will order from Red Angel again. I got exactly what I wanted and the shipping was very fast!</li>
            <li> I just got my package of Red Angel Beauty stamping plates and I have to say I&#x27;m blown away!  The images are clean and sharp, the stamps are big enough even for thumb nails and they shipped fast!  Now my only problem is deciding which one to use first!  I need more fingers.  :-)</li>
            <li> The plates are great, they stamp very well and the designs are gorgeous. I was very excited to receive these, they ship fast and the packaging is perfect. They come with a blue film over each plate so don&#x27;t forget to take that off before you start stamping!</li>
            <li> I gave it two stars because at least some of the plates were fine, but the majority of them were warped plates. I have three of them that have missing or half cut out designs, and one of the plates are not even a full circle. It&#x27;s been cut into a half crescent. I would like a replacement set if possible this is not worth the money I spent on them which is a shame because they do have some good looking designs.</li>
            <li> Love the plates............ just one issue is that they are very sharp...they need some sort of backing!!!!! Angels on 2 plates are missing wings also. Overall they are nice......Great designs .....just wish I had not cut my finger taking them out of the plastic sleeve. Someone suggested using a sticky foam on the back going to try that.</li>
            <li> I am new at nail stamping.  I have had success with Konad plates and was afraid to try this less expensive brand.  I used the red angel plates on my 4th attempt at nail stamping ever and it worked perfectly.  The image transferred without any problems every time.  I can highly recommend this product.  The price was great and the images are fun, fun, fun!!  I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.  See the photo above that I used image plate 120.  I only used a portion of the image.</li>
            <li> Some of the fairy designs on these sets are missing their wings. Kind of disappointing, but overall the plates are still a great value.</li>
            <li> I love them. They were shipped fast and the were exactly as advertised. I found the stamps very easy to use and a high quality product.</li>
            <li> Excellent plates! I&#x27;m very impressed with the quality of these plates. So far, I have tried about six plates and all the images transferred crisp and clear. Loving them and hope to see more from Red Angel.</li>
            <li> Their ok and do their job, the only thing is they rally sharp and need be handle carfuly.[[ASIN:B005VX8S4G Red Angel (tm) Nail Art Nailart Polish Stamp Stamping Manicure Image Plates Accessories Set Kit 21pc]]</li>
            <li> I love these plates! The images come out very clean and look good on my nails.  I am looking for to more image plates to come out.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> When these plates arrived I fell in love with the images. I started using them right away. Most of the images worked great, but some did not pick or transfer well. So i ordered a different brand of stamper. Now I have no issues at all. These plates arev a great deal!! i have been stamping for a year now, I wish that I had orderd these plates sooner!!  Red Angel PLEASE MAKE ANOTHER SET SOON!!!!! :D</li>
            <li> Full size nail stamps didn&#x27;t fit my entire nail. Other than that, I really like it</li>
            <li> Images are large and well-cut. Love the designs - all totally different from 1st &amp; 2nd Bundle Monster sets. A nice addition!</li>
            <li> These plates are great. They are great quality for a very reasonable price. I am very pleased with my purchase. I have played around with several designs and do far they have all came out perfect.</li>
            <li> After doing a manicure with these plates I had about 80% of each design actually show up on my nails. If I had no other choice I would have kept these, but I am still looking for a bulk order that actually works the way it should.</li>
            <li> While the images aren&#x27;t quite as well etched into the metal as Konad plates are, Red Angel is the best alternative I have found so far. With some of the other brands that followed Konad at least one image per plate was faulty. I have only found a couple images in the entire 21 plate set that I had trouble with. Also, the whole nail images are larger than most of the other knock off brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However Konad plates are $5-6 each, while Red Angel plates were @$15 for 21 plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to value per dollar spent, I don&#x27;t think you can come up with a better buy than Red Angel. I would buy any stamping product Red Angel produced.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after seeing some of the reviews as well as some of the pics that went with this product. I was really excited about some of the new designs that this particular brand offered so I decided to finally order them. I look forward to trying some of the designs very soon.</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured. As with any plates, it does take a little patience, but they work well.  Would definately again!</li>
            <li> All the stamps are really cute. I haven&#x27;t tried them yet but I have other stamps that I love. Good buy! Also came faster than what the estimated shipping said so that was a bonus.</li>
            <li> I purchase a red Angel  Nail Art Stamping for my wife Birthday. I am very dissapointed, because the images on the plates are too shallow, hence the reason the pattern is not ;printing.  Very, very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Some of the plates work great, others don&#x27;t seem to transfer very well or at all.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, they are just alright.</li>
            <li> These plates have so many different images not repeated ones like the other plates. The image transfer very good from all plates. Also work very good with other polishes that are not konad. I would recommend this set and the seller. Had a lil delay because of post office loosing package but seller was very helpful and send out a replacement.</li>
            <li> Great designs. Love the quantity and quality. I totally recommend these plates to anyone. with a little practice it is a cinch to do.</li>
            <li> I really wanted these sets .. I bought both .. to be my favorites but some of the images are just not engraved all that well. Most that I used worked .. but some seem to lack in detail or do not pick up at all. Still would buy their next set just because for the price I can justify a few bad images.</li>
            <li> These Red Angel nail plates have designs that you will not see in any other set. They are a great set to start with if you are interested in stamping &amp; are not too picky about your nails. The image quality is not as good as some other brands so if you&#x27;re a perfectionist then you&#x27;ll want to spend $5-$7 on each plate. For the price these are a bargain &amp; the quality is good, just not the best.</li>
            <li> I have been doing nail art for many years, but I only recently discovered how amazing nail stamping can be! The plates are of the best quality, the prints are deep and catch the polish well, equaling very good transfer to a stamper and then to your nail. Highly recommend you try these plates!</li>
            <li> This item is cheap but it does it job pretty well.  I am still getting use to the whole stamping process but I am pleased with the results. There are plenty of nice designs to chose from.</li>
            <li> I must say I ADORE the designs on these plates they&#x27;re simply stunning..However apparently my nails must be considered Very Long and wide as the only fingers the images fit are my ring and pinkie ;( I&#x27;m still keeping the set as there are lots on non full nail images that are adorable and I can use all the others on my friends daughters nails which will thrill them. I&#x27;m going to go with a DRK-A plate and I&#x27;m hoping they&#x27;ll work out. As an additional note these are roughly the same size as all of the standard plates out there so if they fit so should these and I would most definitely put these on you high priority list!!!</li>
            <li> These plates are super cute and the designs are very unique! The plates do have a paper-backing so that the edges aren&#x27;t so sharp! I love them!!</li>
            <li> Good Image plates at a good cost value.  Some images are similar to other manufacturer&#x27;s but there were some different images that I did not have in my vast Image Plate collection.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> I am a nail tech and own my own salon and my customers keep coming back because I very regularly invest in new designs for them. I decided to try out the Red Angel plates for the first time and they have been a HUGE hit. I&#x27;ve used at least one print off of each plate and so far, they are absolutely perfect. All images are etched well and even very small details come out. There is a bow on one of the plates that has been a huge hit and it has a very dainty lace design on it and that comes off the plate and onto the nail very clearly.&lt;br /&gt;My only qualm is that the sides are a little sharp so if you&#x27;re not careful you can cut your finger and that these need a proper carrying case- like a photo album made specifically to hold the plates or something.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very happy and will order more Red Angel plates!</li>
            <li> I love this set and it does its job. I mean the images came out perfect when I stamp my nails with it. And the way how it came wrapped was good.</li>
            <li> Met my expections! All the plates worked very well stamps clean &amp; easy. I would recommend this to all who loves to do nails</li>
            <li> I thought the Red Angel Stamps were a good idea.  I have watched many YouTube Videos and have gone to lots of websites to get hints, tricks, and how-tos.  I even wasted too much money on \\&quot;special nail polish.\\&quot;  After more than a few hours of trying to get it to work, the best I was able to come up with is some inconsistent transfers.  The plates are a real waste of money.</li>
            <li> Unfourtnately several images don&#x27;t stamp well at all, it seems the etching isn&#x27;t consistent and the images won&#x27;t transfer. It&#x27;s a bummer, because I was really excited to get this set. Red Angel images are cute, but worthless if they don&#x27;t work. I will try to contact the seller and see if my dud plates can be replaced. That may be what makes me a return customer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE*** I had 2 plates that were duds, so I emailed the seller and immediately got a response that they had shipped replacements for the defective plates. Sure enough, a few days later, they arrived and I am very impressed with the prompt action and courtesy JMGlobal provided. I have been using my images and have been having fun with them :)  This set is a great addition to any stamping collection!</li>
            <li> Though I haven&#x27;t used all of the plates, I already have a few favorites that I&#x27;ve used serveral times.  Works well with Color Clubs Halo Hues holographic polishes</li>
            <li> So many great designs on these plates, and a great price for how many designs you get.  Easy to use, high quality plates.  Fast shipping and responses, impressive customer service.  Highly recommended, would definitely buy from again!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> ok, good designs on some. The only issue i had with them is that some images are to big for my nails (i have natural short nails), it would come out more like lines and geometric designs instead of an image or background. Practice does make perfect, however some just have issues. Seems to that they would would great for some with acrylic or long nails.  Still there are enough great designs in this batch that work to satisfy me. All in all, I am happy with the product will definitely order from them again. Plus i got it super fast ^_^ (it came in 3 days!)</li>
            <li> For the price, it is a great deal.  Plates RA-110 (Christmas bell, peppermint swirl &amp; heart), RA-116 (feathers &amp; flowers), RA-118 (leaf &amp; flowers) are my favorites.</li>
            <li> I am currently making it my mission to purchase as many nail stamping sets as possible!  Wonderful price, great quality, speedy delivery!!!</li>
            <li> So many good designs. Fun to use! I&#x27;m a professional nail tech and use them all the time.  Good buy!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to enjoy my plates, You have to try a lot of times to get what You want.</li>
            <li> Very nice, lost of images, can&#x27;t wait to use them all and start making eventually my own designs. !!! !</li>
            <li> Love the designs. Not really much else to say! Takes practice if you have never stamped before but really fun :)</li>
            <li> Package was sticky and had other products&#x27; labels on them.  2 plates were gouged beyond use but the company replaced them fast &amp; free.</li>
            <li> Came as described in their own plastic pouch and covered with plastic film.  The one&#x27;s that I have used so far work great.  From what I can see of the images I don&#x27;t expect to have a problem with any of them working.</li>
            <li> I have lost count of how many of these I have, I&#x27;m just addicted to all Nail Plates and polishes. You will be too!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very impressed by these nail stamping plates.  I only got one or two images that would transfer properly.  The images are really shallow and don&#x27;t pick up the design at all. A real waste of your time and money.  If Red Angel wants to send me new some plates with better images, then I&#x27;m all for it. I might change my review.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve tried 5 of the designs, and they are all fairly difficult to transfer over. Any other brand I can use the same nail polish on, but only one of my polishes will transfer over from these plates with any success. One of the plates came HIGHLY damaged with a huge gauge of a scratch right down the middle, and another was lightly scratched several times like something had scraped it. The designs are great, but I don&#x27;t like spending that much time redoing a nail over and over trying to get it to apply. Nor do I like that it came damaged.</li>
            <li> I have had these plates almost two months now, I wanted to give them a fair chance before I commented on them. I am new to nail art stamping and these are the very first set of plates that I bought. When I was looking online I thought that this set had the prettiest images of all the the sets available so I ordered them. They came in a little plastic pouch that can be used for storage and had the proper backing, even the blue plastic came of without much fuss. They were really great until I started to use them.&lt;br /&gt;When I got them home and tried them out I was convinced that I was doing something wrong. Paint, scrape and stamp right? I couldnt get the images to pick up they were faded,they didnt transfer. In all fairness I didn&#x27;t use it with special polish, just regular polish and I was mostly scraping with an old card because the metal scraper I have scrapes my plates which is annoying. I thought that this might be reason why. After these I got plates from GALS, Cheeky, Konad and Pueen, I used the same plastic card and polishes and had no issues.&lt;br /&gt;The images will pick up maybe three times out of five. Some of the images are hard to clean because the lines are so fine like the heart and line tip on plate RA101. This makes it kind of difficult to use consecutively.&lt;br /&gt;Another thing is that these images are kind of small , the full plate ones are slightly less than half an inch and my thumb is just over half an inch so given that twelve out of the twenty plates are full nail designs and the one tip plate is also too small, I don&#x27;t get much use out of them.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t discourage anybody from buying them because I still think they have some of the prettiest images so if you have smaller hands and the patience to keep stamping the same image over and over, go for it. If you have larger nails this is just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> When the plates arrive, and the blue protective plastic is removed, most of the plates arrive damaged.  Five out of 21 plates arrived badly damaged.  I immediately contacted the seller and they promised to replace the damaged plates.  It has been 29 days, and I have not received the replacements.  I have contacted them several times.  You may want to purchase PUEEN plates.  I have placed two orders from PUEEN and overall the plates arrived in good condition.  You end up paying around the same amount with shipping and handling (Pueen &#x3D; $18.99 and Red Angel &#x3D; $18.65).</li>
