            <li>All the colors show up perfect on my lips</li>
            <li>My daughter loves the bright colors.  </li>
            <li>Love them a lil bright but great on my skin</li>
            <li>The colors are great, some definitely better than others.</li>
            <li>some colors are great and very opaque, while others aren&#x27;t that good.</li>
            <li>For the price, they work, and are cute colors.</li>
            <li>so they&#x27;re okay for that.</li>
            <li>as much anyone considering this product will be most pleased :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll take photos but, everything came fine.</li>
            <li>Also, the free gift earring was not included with my purchase.</li>
            <li>the colors are very pigmented and they smell delicious as well each one different.</li>
            <li>Grear colors but no earrings... wasn&#x27;t excited about the earring anyway</li>
            <li>but the lipstick tubes are so pretty even better</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing color lipstick I have ever used or seen not only that</li>
            <li>But lots of cool colors.</li>
            <li>I love the colors and it kinda acts like a lip stain I don&#x27;t really have to reapply</li>
            <li>The shipping was right on time from when they said.</li>
            <li>Real creamy nice neon colors.long lasting.</li>
            <li>I most likely will not but again.</li>
            <li>They were not expensive for 12 lip shades, so you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Stays on very well!</li>
            <li>The colors for me all work good except the light pink, light blue, medium blue and lime yellow green but the others look great.</li>
            <li>The free earring wasn&#x27;t in the package and the light green color was broken.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t really stick on too well</li>
            <li>I was again too high expectations.</li>
            <li>The orange goes on easily and is actually very smooth, same with the pinks and purples, the yellow is very see through and if your lips aren&#x27;t perfectly smooth, it would cake up on them as with a few other colors in this bundle.</li>
            <li>then the pictures its so vibrant exotic and unbelievable</li>
            <li>light and smelled slightly.</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t work under black light.</li>
            <li>very translucent, and several layers is needed to get the desired color for some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The other colors are pretty and vibrant.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not like the cheap crud you usually get</li>
            <li>I like the colors of the lipsticks, but they are thin &amp; will need to be applied often as they easily smear off.</li>

            <li> All the colors show up perfect on my lips</li>
            <li> some colors are great and very opaque, while others aren&#x27;t that good. The orange goes on easily and is actually very smooth, same with the pinks and purples, the yellow is very see through and if your lips aren&#x27;t perfectly smooth, it would cake up on them as with a few other colors in this bundle. None of them can compare to the NYX neon colors, though. For the price, they work, and are cute colors.</li>
            <li> Love them a lil bright but great on my skin</li>
            <li> The colors for me all work good except the light pink, light blue, medium blue and lime yellow green but the others look great. They don&#x27;t really stick on too well so I wouldn&#x27;t wear them out in public however I got them to take pictures in for my page so they&#x27;re okay for that.</li>
            <li> The colors are great, some definitely better than others. I bought these for festival season. very translucent, and several layers is needed to get the desired color for some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were wanting these for everyday use, I would spend the money for a nicer brand, but they did the job.</li>
            <li> Grear colors but no earrings... wasn&#x27;t excited about the earring anyway but if it&#x27;s advertised then it should be in the package.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll take photos but, everything came fine. I got all the colors as seen. The only thing that&#x27;s a little weird is the how moist this lipstick is and it comes off a tiny bit but not without a fight.</li>
            <li> They where broken and the seals where also broke. Never buy them again.</li>
            <li> light and smelled slightly.</li>
            <li> I received them on time, but 3 sticks were broken, I had to fix, so I could use them, and no &amp;#34;free earrings&amp;#34; were given. I most likely will not but again. I do like all the colors, but for the conditions I got some in and what I paid, kinda disappointed.</li>

            <li> I like the colors of the lipsticks, but they are thin &amp; will need to be applied often as they easily smear off. They were not expensive for 12 lip shades, so you get what you pay for. Also, the free gift earring was not included with my purchase. Tried contacting the seller about it, and got no response.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the bright colors.  Stays on very well!</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing color lipstick I have ever used or seen not only that but the lipstick tubes are so pretty even better then the pictures its so vibrant exotic and unbelievable I couldn&#x27;t stop testing each color and it&#x27;s not like the cheap crud you usually get</li>
            <li> Basic stuff. I was again too high expectations.</li>
