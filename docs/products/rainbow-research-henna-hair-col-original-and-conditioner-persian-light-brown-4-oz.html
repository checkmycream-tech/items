            <li>I followed the directions given for grey hair, and it was very successful at covering these - they look like highlights.</li>
            <li>I love being able to color my own hair at my own convience with a natural product that doesn&#x27;t burn my scalp and is affordable.</li>

            <li>Some stylists feel more comfortable than others using henna.  </li>
            <li>Henna is safe, which is extremely important to me (non-toxic) - I can put up with the messiness and also the smell of leaves -</li>
            <li>It cleaned off easily from my skin, towels, porcelain and tile, unlike permanent dyes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use</li>
            <li>My hair is the fine hair.</li>
            <li>I feel that starting with a lighter color first works best.  </li>
            <li>(it is fine to mix colors).</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s a light color</li>

            <li>( I think you could also start with clean DAMP hair)</li>
            <li>the results were amazing, and my hair is amazingly soft.</li>
            <li>If you are artistic you may want to combine colors.  </li>
            <li>I have used it several times and have found that it works better for my hair if I use more liquid than instructed to.  </li>
            <li>I have heard that various applications of oil (such as coconut) will help lift it off the hair, but it is best to think of it as basically permanent.</li>
            <li>I received my order so quick (2 days) and tried this product as soon as it arrived.</li>
            <li>Yes, it can get messy, but my color turned out great</li>
            <li>It was no longer green, when I took my shower cap off to rinse, I&#x27;m happy to stay.  </li>
            <li>I love the color and it did cover the gray hair completely even though it is lighter than the rest of my hair</li>
            <li>I love using light brown to make my hair look like I have blonde highlights.  </li>
            <li>People stop me on the street to tell me how lovely my hair color looks (even someone who is a hairdresser thought it was natural color).</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t add all the water right away.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t add all the water right away.  </li>
            <li>Together these colors add up to a lovely light brown (it is the henna which sticks to grey hairs</li>
            <li>I added and coffee, and black tea, and an egg, olive oil and vinegar :D turned out gold&#x27;ish brown and my grey hairs looked golden brownish as well</li>
            <li>I buy from Amazon all the time, but this is my first product review because I am AMAZED with the results of this Henna.</li>
            <li>really!</li>
            <li>I am mostly gray and have been dying my hair for several years.  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly.  </li>
            <li>That could be because dying it multiple times  gives the ends  more exposure.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- kneel in your tub and put your head under the faucet first to get the excess off.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a problem since I make sure there is no hair clog prior to this process.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- kneel in your tub and put your head under the faucet first to get the excess off.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a problem since I make sure there is no hair clog prior to this process.</li>
            <li>I actually added more liquid to mine so that it would be smoother and easier to apply.  </li>
            <li>Please be aware that henna WILL interact with chemical hair dye if you have it on your hair, so you must wait a while before applying it if you have used chemical dyes (or your hair</li>
            <li>will be diluting more next time.</li>
            <li>My hair is light brown, naturally.  </li>
            <li>I think you could leave it on safely for an extra thirty minutes to an hour longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think you could leave it on safely for an extra thirty minutes to an hour longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it might have to be applied more often, but that is no big deal.</li>
            <li>Make sure it is not too thick (more like yogurt)</li>
            <li>It is best notto wash it for at least 48-72 hours after using (rinsing it out is necessary of course - just not shampoo) because the color is still &amp;#34;setting&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>then did my whole head.</li>
            <li>my hair looks shiny and much</li>
            <li>I thought this was a ready to use product, but there is mixing, then boiling water, mixing again and applying like dye then waiting.  </li>
            <li>The directions are written really well.  </li>
            <li>Really like this product.  </li>
            <li>but this might not be something you value as much, so it is something to consider.   </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much about this aspect as my hair wasn&#x27;t dyed, but you should research this if this is your case</li>
            <li>Probably too much,</li>
            <li>Probably too much,</li>
            <li>It took a month before I really started to notice it fading.</li>
            <li>It is also very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>My hair is now back to auburn after using the light brown formula.</li>
            <li>So I rinsed it and rinsed it and washed with some shampoo then a good, thick conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It did take a long time to wash out and does have a strong earthy, grassy smell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I read the other reviews and their helpful hints.  </li>
            <li>I did not add vinegar or anything as was suggested to help with a more complete coverage of grey.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of dry and gritty when you&#x27;re trying to rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Well, when they say to start with clean, dry hair.</li>
            <li>back when I used to color my hair just for fun.  </li>

            <li>But my final word is that it is WORTH IT to me and they sent me two jars.  </li>
            <li>I now know that henna leaves my hair conditioned and a very natural shade.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I used this henna, I took this and all the extra ingredients to my hair stylist so she could apply it, and use all her equipment (the caps, the heating).  </li>

            <li>mixed about half of the container of this light brown henna with boiling hot coffee, two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar, and two tablespoons of olive oil per manufacturer instructions.  </li>
            <li>but I just don&#x27;t feel clean if I don&#x27;t, and I tend to wash hair color out of my hair a lot sooner than other people might.  </li>

            <li>This product is actually a mixture of pure henna (which is red/orange) and indigo (another plant, with a bluish tone) plus another colorless plant.</li>
            <li>It lasts for at least 6 weeks, but I don&#x27;t feel I need to re-do it until more than 8 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t worry if you feel like the tub is not draining fast enough, your tub uses suction when the shower head is on to remove the excess water in</li>

            <li>Rinsed/rinsed/rinsed/rinsed out as much as I could - henna left quite a bit of grit in my hair.  </li>
            <li>You really need to shampoo and especially condition to get all of this stuff out of your hair.  </li>
            <li>But this has held so far</li>
            <li>But this has held so far</li>
            <li>My hair came out a warmer brown than my natural color, but it still looks natural.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally light brown with red highlights, but bleaches out due to sun/water in the summer.  </li>
            <li>It is rather coarse...not as fine as henna I used in the past.  </li>
            <li>It does cover my dark brown hair to make it a warmer golden color.  </li>
            <li>So I did some research before ordering this product, both on the Amazon website and on the Rainbow Research website and a few other places just to see as many product reviews as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;take&amp;#34; exactly the same on each hair, but it is slightly variegated, so it looks very natural.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s supposed to bring out golden tones, and I&#x27;ll thin it out a little more.</li>
            <li>I tried this color henna to get back to my natural color.  </li>
            <li>To prepare for this I simply covered my hairline in Vaseline, lined my sink with paper towels, and threw an old towel on the floor.</li>
            <li>You want it to be smooth like thick pudding, but not so moist it is runny.  </li>
            <li>You want it to be smooth like thick pudding, but not so moist it is runny.  </li>
            <li>I used this for the first time the other night, and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results!  </li>
            <li>My advice is to make sure the mix is not too thick because then it&#x27;s much harder to apply it evenly.</li>
            <li>I also prefer to use coffee in the place of water, it creates a much richer brown and less &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; tones (which I prefer).  </li>

            <li> My hair is naturally light brown with red highlights, but bleaches out due to sun/water in the summer.  </li>
            <li> It is rather coarse...not as fine as henna I used in the past.  </li>
            <li> It does cover my dark brown hair to make it a warmer golden color.  </li>
            <li> So I did some research before ordering this product, both on the Amazon website and on the Rainbow Research website and a few other places just to see as many product reviews as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;take&amp;#34; exactly the same on each hair, but it is slightly variegated, so it looks very natural.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s supposed to bring out golden tones, and I&#x27;ll thin it out a little more.</li>
            <li> I tried this color henna to get back to my natural color.  </li>
            <li> To prepare for this I simply covered my hairline in Vaseline, lined my sink with paper towels, and threw an old towel on the floor.</li>

            <li> My advice is to make sure the mix is not too thick because then it&#x27;s much harder to apply it evenly.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s hard to say what you&#x27;re exact color will be at the end since it depends on your hair color and the time you leave it on.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I buy from Amazon all the time, but this is my first product review because I am AMAZED with the results of this Henna. I stopped using highlights because my hair was thinning- as soon as I stopped the chemical hair treatment, my hair was healthier- but with a lot of gray- I told myself that gray was just the way it was going to be- I&#x27;m 48 after all...but- my sister and law convinced me to try this product- did a test strand- then did my whole head. I was thrilled- really! Color was vibrant- reddish, and the gray strands look like blind highlights- an added benefit- my hair looks shiny and much healthier- I&#x27;m a convert and so happy that a botanical product exits for hair color. Advice- take your time- coat every strand as best you can and wrap your whole head in plastic wrap after- it works.</li>
            <li> My hair is the fine hair. My hair got frizzy hair. Bought 2 because returned one. Not for my hair.  If you want to get the terminal hair, maybe could be.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent.  I used it to touch up the roots on previously colored hair.  Interestingly, it actually covered over darker hair and came out lighter than the darker hair - I&#x27;m surprised because henna typically cannot lighten, only darken.  I applied this to graying hair and it took - usually you have to do two passes on gray hair.  I can&#x27;t recommend this product highly enough.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a ready to use product, but there is mixing, then boiling water, mixing again and applying like dye then waiting.  I am a Registered Nurse and do not have time to wait almost an hour while something &amp;#34;works&amp;#34;.  I want to return.</li>
            <li> I received the product and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.  I am mostly gray and have been dying my hair for several years.  I had about 2 inches of gray showing and the rest dark brown.  I followed the directions exactly.  I did not add vinegar or anything as was suggested to help with a more complete coverage of grey.  I allowed the product to be on my hair for just under 60 minutes.  It did take a long time to wash out and does have a strong earthy, grassy smell.  I love the color and it did cover the gray hair completely even though it is lighter than the rest of my hair it gave the rest of my hair a nice highlighted look.  I intend to keep using this product until all the dyed hair grows out.  My hair and scalp feel much better with this product than using hair dyes.</li>
            <li> Covers gray well. I used it with coffee, as recommended, to increase &amp;#34;brownness&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I love this henna!  I have used it on myself for over a year, and also hennaed my friend&#x27;s hair.  We both have 20-30% gray hair.  I didn&#x27;t want to use chemicals on my hair since I have a lot of sensitivities.  It cleaned off easily from my skin, towels, porcelain and tile, unlike permanent dyes.  The directions are written really well.  I looked through a few reviews before my initial use to get tricks and tips.  Since they were helpful to me I thought I&#x27;d write my experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dark ash brown hair, my gray hair is silver.  I love using light brown to make my hair look like I have blonde highlights.  It does cover my dark brown hair to make it a warmer golden color.  It lasts for at least 6 weeks, but I don&#x27;t feel I need to re-do it until more than 8 weeks.  I don&#x27;t know how it does it, but it fades around your hair line so I don&#x27;t see or feel I have a line where I dyed my hair. Believe me, I have an eye for that detail and I inspect it regularly. It does tend to be more permanent around the ends of hair.  That could be because dying it multiple times  gives the ends  more exposure.  Since it&#x27;s a light color I just do my entire head for touch ups.  It&#x27;s hard to say what you&#x27;re exact color will be at the end since it depends on your hair color and the time you leave it on.  I feel that starting with a lighter color first works best.  You can also go darker.  If you are artistic you may want to combine colors.  In it&#x27;s pre-mix state, it is just a powder.  Use a weighing scale to repeat your results for color mixing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using:&lt;br /&gt;- put it on wet hair.  Otherwise it won&#x27;t stick as well.  It will start to crumble rather than coat your hair. You also won&#x27;t have enough to fully cover your hair.&lt;br /&gt;- use coffee or black  tea instead of water, to make it less brassy.&lt;br /&gt;- use apple vinegar to make it stick to your gray hair.&lt;br /&gt;- Mix the vinegar with a raw egg&lt;br /&gt;- AFTER  mixing most of the HOT coffer or water with the henna and you have mixed it well, add the raw egg.  Otherwise you cook the egg if you dump it in with the water (guess how I know)&lt;br /&gt;- Don&#x27;t add all the water right away.  Depending on humidity you may need more or less water.  You want it to be smooth like thick pudding, but not so moist it is runny.  Dip a gloved finger in it to see the consistency.  No liquid should run or drip from it.&lt;br /&gt;- When applying, start on the most gray areas first.  That way it will have the longest amount of time to sit on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;- I use a heating cap I bought on Amazon.  I feel the cap makes it shinier and softer.  It also seems to make  the color stay on my hair longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When rinsing:&lt;br /&gt;- kneel in your tub and put your head under the faucet first to get the excess off.  Don&#x27;t worry if you feel like the tub is not draining fast enough, your tub uses suction when the shower head is on to remove the excess water in the tub.&lt;br /&gt;- shampoo your hair several times.  You may still feel there is residual on your hair (I&#x27;m picky).  But it will come out in the next day&#x27;s shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;- I clogged the shower once.  Only once. It was already draining slow due to a hair clog.  I just got out the plunger and plunged until the water flowed.  I haven&#x27;t had a problem since I make sure there is no hair clog prior to this process. I thought I would mention it in case someone was worried this might happen, or it happened in the middle of rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this henna, I took this and all the extra ingredients to my hair stylist so she could apply it, and use all her equipment (the caps, the heating).  I let her charge me the same price. I was happy to just not be exposed to the chemicals.  Some stylists feel more comfortable than others using henna.

            <li> This is not a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; henna product. It will seal your hair and no hair color will penetrate it.  You will have to have your hair stripped before hair color can be applied.  Your $125 cut and color just turned into another hour and probably $80 more depending on where you have hair done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have used this product, you must let colorist know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that never intend on coloring hair in future, this product may work for you. Henna shades are lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to someone that never plans on coloring hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I have used it several times and have found that it works better for my hair if I use more liquid than instructed to.  I also prefer to use coffee in the place of water, it creates a much richer brown and less &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; tones (which I prefer).  I love being able to color my own hair at my own convience with a natural product that doesn&#x27;t burn my scalp and is affordable.</li>
            <li> Really like this product.  I&#x27;m glad I read the other reviews and their helpful hints.  I actually added more liquid to mine so that it would be smoother and easier to apply.  Yes, it can get messy, but my color turned out great and I think my hair is healthier already.  I have sisterlocs and they permeate my locs and still give good color.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product! I followed the directions given for grey hair, and it was very successful at covering these - they look like highlights. I left it on 4 hours, and wrapped my head in saran wrap (upon advice from Indian hair stylist), and followed this with a wool cap. Heat is very important for henna color to develop, so be patient. Henna is NOT like chemical hair dye - it is a ground up leaf - when you add liquid it will become a paste. Make sure it is not too thick (more like yogurt) because a) it will be clumpy and won&#x27;t cover all hairs well and b) because it needs water to release its color. Too runny is not good either. If you look on the internet you will find lots of pics with good advice on this. This product is actually a mixture of pure henna (which is red/orange) and indigo (another plant, with a bluish tone) plus another colorless plant. Together these colors add up to a lovely light brown (it is the henna which sticks to grey hairs BTW - indigo then sticks to the henna). Darker tones in the Rainbow line have a greater proportion of indigo, and redder tones have a greater proportion of henna.  A good thing to know is that this henna will NOT dye any of the skin on your face (or your ears) so there is no need to be concerned with this when you wrap up your hair while the henna is releasing its color (henna WILL dye the skin of the hands, however, so you must use gloves!) It IS messy (line your sink with paper towels, put newspaper down on the floor or do it in the shower - careful not to get too much down the drain if you have issues with clogging) but in my opinion extremely worth it. People stop me on the street to tell me how lovely my hair color looks (even someone who is a hairdresser thought it was natural color). Henna is safe, which is extremely important to me (non-toxic) - I can put up with the messiness and also the smell of leaves - but this might not be something you value as much, so it is something to consider.   It is best notto wash it for at least 48-72 hours after using (rinsing it out is necessary of course - just not shampoo) because the color is still &amp;#34;setting&amp;#34;. For me the color lasts months (I just have to re-touch the roots). Please be aware that henna WILL interact with chemical hair dye if you have it on your hair, so you must wait a while before applying it if you have used chemical dyes (or your hair will turn green) I don&#x27;t know much about this aspect as my hair wasn&#x27;t dyed, but you should research this if this is your case (you must wait a few weeks between applying chemical hair dye and henna). Also know that Henna is permanent - it binds to the hair, and coats it - so it will be very hard to remove it. You can darken the color, but not lighten it so you should start lighter and go darker with subsequent applications if you want to experiment with the color (it is fine to mix colors). I have heard that various applications of oil (such as coconut) will help lift it off the hair, but it is best to think of it as basically permanent. Again, look on the internet as there is a wealth of information….!! Good luck!</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally light brown with red highlights, but bleaches out due to sun/water in the summer.  I tried this color henna to get back to my natural color.  Big mistake!!! I followed instructions carefully and ended up with a green paste.  Left it on my hair for 60 min.  Rinsed/rinsed/rinsed/rinsed out as much as I could - henna left quite a bit of grit in my hair.  Shampooed and conditioned.  Although I was darker, I now unfortunately have a green highlight to my hair instead of a natural red one.</li>
            <li> I always heard henna ends up really dark, but the light brown didn&#x27;t do much other than make my hair smell like grass and was dry for a week.&lt;br /&gt;Tried the same brand in dark brown and the results were amazing, and my hair is amazingly soft. Think I just got a bad batch with this one.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this henna. My advice is to make sure the mix is not too thick because then it&#x27;s much harder to apply it evenly. That was the mistake I had and will be diluting more next time. My hair is waist-long and one jar was barely enough. I added and coffee, and black tea, and an egg, olive oil and vinegar :D turned out gold&#x27;ish brown and my grey hairs looked golden brownish as well (I&#x27;m 29 and I have about 2% gray hairs). My hair felt SO silky and smooth after it! Will be buying more!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I did wrong, but it didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> I have using this henna for a while now.  It&#x27;s easy to use and I get complements on the color.  Not only does it work well as a dye, but my hair seems thicker and healthier afterwards.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.  I haven&#x27;t used any henna hair color of any type since the 80&#x27;s...back when I used to color my hair just for fun.  Ha!  I&#x27;m now fifty-one, and I have about 30% gray hair to color.  My hair is light brown, naturally.  I used to use a product called Hennalucent that was really wonderful, but it has been discontinued.  I had to STOP using other kinds of hair color, i.e. salon color, box hair color because they were making my scalp itch and break out.  Not good.  Not to mention I feel like those hair colors were damaging my hair over time.  So I did some research before ordering this product, both on the Amazon website and on the Rainbow Research website and a few other places just to see as many product reviews as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mixed about half of the container of this light brown henna with boiling hot coffee, two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar, and two tablespoons of olive oil per manufacturer instructions.  I used the coffee to help tone down the red...it is henna, after all.  The vinegar is for helping the henna hold onto gray hair a little better.  The olive oil is for conditioning.  This mixture is hard to get stirred up and get the lumps out, I must admit.  It is rather coarse...not as fine as henna I used in the past.  I know a lot of reviewers also complain about the smell.  Well it has a smell like grass or hay. And it is the vibrant green of grass clippings when you mix it up, which might be a little disconcerting for first-time users.  In any case, I put this stuff all over my hair, which was about  two and a half or three inches below shoulder length, at the time.  I then put a shower cap on over it and left it on for an hour.  It was no longer green, when I took my shower cap off to rinse, I&#x27;m happy to stay.  More of a brown color.  So I rinsed it and rinsed it and washed with some shampoo then a good, thick conditioner.  You really need to shampoo and especially condition to get all of this stuff out of your hair.  It&#x27;s kind of dry and gritty when you&#x27;re trying to rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final result was excellent!  A natural looking light brown..NOT red.  And my grays were a bit lighter so they blended and looked like highlights.  Tips for users - I read some other complaints about the product online - complaints about the smell - it goes away after a wash or two.  A few said it turned their hair orange...or green.  Well, when they say to start with clean, dry hair. ( I think you could also start with clean DAMP hair) that means you shouldn&#x27;t have any other styling product in it that could react with the henna.  I also didn&#x27;t use ANY hair color of ANY kind for four months before I used this. .I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s necessary, but I feel not having any salon or boxed color on my hair helped my result.  The only thing I would have done differently is to leave it on a little longer, I think.  I wash my hair a LOT.  Probably too much, but I just don&#x27;t feel clean if I don&#x27;t, and I tend to wash hair color out of my hair a lot sooner than other people might.  But this has held so far and it&#x27;s been about three weeks.  I think you could leave it on safely for an extra thirty minutes to an hour longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have to rinse my tub and shower out afterwards.  The stuff gets all over when rinsing it out.  But my final word is that it is WORTH IT to me and they sent me two jars.  Enough product to color my hair about three times!  Good investment.our hair.

            <li> Absolutely the best product on the market for dying your hair. It is totally botanical and organic. The color is rich and because it is botanical it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;take&amp;#34; exactly the same on each hair, but it is slightly variegated, so it looks very natural. It is not sold as permanent color but it lasts for a very long time. It took a month before I really started to notice it fading. If it were summer and I were washing my hair more often it might have to be applied more often, but that is no big deal. It is easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad or sting like regular hair dye. It is also very inexpensive. What else could you ask for? It is virtually a perfect product. It could not be better.</li>
            <li> I received my order so quick (2 days) and tried this product as soon as it arrived. I read the reviews so I already knew that henna is smelly (sort of like dirt and manure) and it was messy. To prepare for this I simply covered my hairline in Vaseline, lined my sink with paper towels, and threw an old towel on the floor. I was very impressed with my results. My hair severely fades through summer from auburn to a weird shade of muted blond. My hair is now back to auburn after using the light brown formula. I am going up a shade next time because I was scared of using henna. I now know that henna leaves my hair conditioned and a very natural shade. I will use this product again especially since it is extremely affordable.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time the other night, and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results!  I have medium brown hair with a little gray and I&#x27;ve never dyed my hair before.  I mixed the henna with coffee and apple cider vinegar, like the directions suggested.  My hair came out a warmer brown than my natural color, but it still looks natural.  I think next time I&#x27;ll try adding the black china tea - that&#x27;s supposed to bring out golden tones, and I&#x27;ll thin it out a little more.</li>
