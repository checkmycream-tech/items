            <li>Not only did it give me perfect and consistent curls</li>
            <li>Ladies if you want to spend less time curling your hairs this is going to be your best friend.</li>
            <li>Super device!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy, fast and effective.</li>
            <li>control buttons are also placed nicely, and the Light up screen is easy to read - no confusing configurations or displays - just a nice simple and easy to use iron!!</li>
            <li>My hair did not ever really hold a curl but this iron is amazing and gets my hair done quickly!</li>
            <li>Definitely give this a try, makes a great gift for any women in your life.</li>
            <li>The timer is great, because it won&#x27;t let you burn your hair off and, depending on what temperature you use, the curl will come out differently.</li>
            <li>So I finally decided to invest in the Miraqeen, and I&#x27;m SO HAPPY that I did.</li>
            <li>It brings fantastic results.</li>
            <li>Works fantastic.</li>
            <li>But, it gives great, lasting curls</li>
            <li>In addition, there’s a 360 degree swivel cord so you can move about freely while you’re curling your hair.</li>
            <li>It keeps my curls frizz free and shiny</li>
            <li>Great value, would definitely recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>The best part is that my curls last whole day.</li>
            <li>For professional grade hair curling, the Miraqueen Professional Steam Curling Wand is an excellent choice.</li>
            <li>I am left with beautiful hair that is full of body and shine.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so straight that even with the best hair products on the market, within thirty minutes it is as flat as a washboard.</li>
            <li>so the different heat settings come in very handy for the two of us.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations based on the reviews here, but my wife ultimately didn&#x27;t find this to be as awesome as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Quick and easy curls.</li>
            <li>super easy to use.</li>
            <li>This curling iron is super easy to use.</li>
            <li>The design makes it quick and easy to get a curly look</li>
            <li>This curling iron is super easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love it very much.</li>
            <li>The price is worth it!</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s exactly what I got and MORE.</li>
            <li>It heats up really quickly and it gets very hot!</li>
            <li>My hair never holds a curl,  but the steam setting makes mine last for a good 16 hours with a light spray rather than caking it on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thanks so much for making this professional curling iron in that I truly enjoy using it and love the manual settings.&amp;#60; My hair never dries in that you can set the heat levels.&amp;#60; :) God bless!</li>
            <li>The LCD screen is so easy to read and this curling iron has three heat levels and the timer insures you get the right curl every time.</li>
            <li>Works OK, but certainly does not curl as well as promised no matter what settings are used.</li>
            <li>but I just couldn&#x27;t find the right technique for my hair!</li>
            <li>I have poofy frizzy hair and this tames my hair into beautiful, soft professional looking curls.</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>Curls thick hair beautifully!</li>
            <li>My curls indeed come out full and bouncy.</li>
            <li>and I don’t have to wait forever because I want to be able to use it when I’M READY to use it.</li>
            <li>I love this product and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>and It&#x27;s easy to use and makes the curls look more natural.</li>
            <li>You absolutely must wear the mitt because this thing gets HOT!!!</li>
            <li>Awesome, no more &amp;#34;hickey&amp;#34; burns!</li>
            <li>It works well, does the job quickly, and doesn&#x27;t burn my hair.</li>
            <li>It heats up so quickly</li>
            <li>Whether you want a low maintenance style or a more sophisticated look, the Miraqueen steam waver can deliver the style you&#x27;re after without damaging your hair.</li>
            <li>I might not be the type to use this product on my hair everyday, but it&#x27;s a LIFESAVER for special occasions, and it works perfectly for even the least experienced at styling hair.</li>
            <li>But I do have to go out and look nice a few times a year, and my hair is straight as a poker (NOT in a good way).</li>
            <li>I purchased the curling iron for my daughter, I purchased one a few months ago and loved it so much and was loving the compliments on how my hair looked.</li>
            <li>so I don’t burn the counter or in that case (the HOUSE) down, lol.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s her new favorite tool for her hair</li>
            <li>This is my favorite new tool in the beauty routine.</li>
            <li>Long or short hair turns out beautifully!</li>
            <li>Miraqueen never fails to impress!</li>
            <li>This curling iron looks so pretty!</li>
            <li>I was worried at first about purchasing this product because, I have tried everything else!</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life I can style my hair!</li>
            <li>Miraqueen is easy to use and provides many different options for curl styles.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This model makes the entire process so easy (no to mention safe...</li>
            <li>Did not work at all right out of the box quick refund tho</li>
            <li>Did not work for my fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li>You cannot take a huge or even a large chunk of hair.</li>
            <li>is of professional standard and has lots of great features.</li>
            <li>This works like a dream and having a selection of temps, steam and different times gives a nice variety of curl.</li>
            <li>Looks fun to operate.</li>
            <li>She curled her hair on her own with no problem, and the curls lasted the entire day!</li>
            <li>so fun to use.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a nice visual to have.  </li>
            <li>Its definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really worth</li>
            <li>told, the Miraqueen works better, quicker and more efficiently than any other curling iron I have ever had.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not hard to read the setting and to find out the temperature because of the easy to read LED screen.  </li>
            <li>and you can set the timer length, temperature, even the direction of the curl right on the screen.</li>
            <li>I took this with me to my trip right after I got it in the mail.</li>
            <li>Yea right.</li>
            <li>I probably didnt use it right.</li>
            <li>It was her first curling iron and I&#x27;ve never seen her more excited to try a present.</li>
            <li>The LCD display is easy to use, in fact the whole unit is easy to use in general.  </li>
            <li>It came to me defective.. bought a new one from sallys ( red one ),works good.</li>
            <li>I wear my hair in many different styles, but so far all my friends say that my beach waves is their favorite hairstyle.</li>
            <li>The loose waves is also my favorite style!</li>
            <li>I have thicker,longer hair and this Iron curls my hair super fast</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have time to look up videos on how to use it, but I was surprised on how easy it was to use.</li>
            <li>I find it very sketchy that all these people bought 4 or 5 of the same items and all gave them amazing reviews.</li>
            <li>SUPER FAST SHIPPING!!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>An easy to use curling wand that leaves hair with a professional finish look.  </li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and ready to go.</li>
            <li>It does get hot quick, so you have to act fast while using it.</li>
            <li>She has very straight hair, that used to never curl</li>
            <li>Does a professional job and quick!</li>
            <li>She also loves hot</li>
            <li>Since I attend numerous gatherings and birthday parties with my friends during this time of the year, I wanted to make sure that I look presentable for my outings this time around</li>
            <li>It makes great curls that last long.</li>
            <li>Although it works better using smaller section of hair</li>
            <li>With the Miraqueen, the heat distribution is pretty even so</li>
            <li>I really love all the different features and settings it has to offer.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>and I love all the different options and settings.</li>
            <li>Over all the wand is well worth the cost, it seems like it is very well made.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>I love that the heating setting goes all the way up to 450 degrees because, at times, I have the frizziest hair and low level heating settings</li>
            <li>I know some people might say higher the temperature</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s durable, safe and a high-quality product that actually lives up to the hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommend for anyone interested in glowing, wavy hair that turns heads.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried steam rollers, hot rollers and curling iron and although they do work for about the first hour, but curls always come out</li>
            <li>This curling iron is a lot better for me than traditional curling irons.</li>
            <li>I thought I had a favorite, but after borrowing this model from my sister on a recent vacation, I realized I had been settling!</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>The  Miraqueen Professional Steam Curling Wand is a curling wand with a ceramic chamber for a smooth curling experience.  </li>
            <li>It has the ability to curl even the most stubborn hair within a short period of time.</li>
            <li>I can definitely say this was one of the better Christmas gifts I&#x27;ve gotten.</li>
            <li>Your hair zips into the heating chambers, and after mere seconds, your perfect curls will come bouncing out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that I have unruly hair.  </li>
            <li>great when I&#x27;m running late and forget to unplug it.  </li>
            <li>you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also beeps when it&#x27;s ready to use, and at the right temp - you can also set the desired time for use, and it will beep when done prompting you to release the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even for a newbie that can barely brush her hair, this iron is SO EASY to use.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product because the curls last a long time and in my opinion it is a very awesome curler!</li>
            <li>Bought this to upgrade my current curling iron that lasted a good 2 years before it finally gave in.  </li>
            <li>but this is so much easier and gives way better curls that last!</li>
            <li>Besides allowing me to have beautiful curls that last, the ceramic materials don&#x27;t damage my hair and the timer keeps me from worrying that I will burn the house down.</li>
            <li>I have long straight - VERY FINE - hair.</li>
            <li>I have very straight hair with a straight perm and it still works,</li>
            <li>I love that it is not just a hot dry plate.</li>
            <li>but i like it as long as it lasts :)</li>
            <li>I just love it , I can curl my long hair and the curl stays in for days .</li>
            <li>In fact, if my hair is not in a ponytail, it&#x27;s pretty much a miracle.</li>
            <li>First off, this curling iron is FAST to heat up.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and hot.  </li>
            <li>The curls, as she says, stay for a long period of time, and much more.</li>
            <li>Last month, I was looking to give my sister a good lasting gift for her birthday and knew any hair care products would be much appreciated.</li>
            <li>All the heating and curling action occurs within the head of the device, leaving the outsides cool to touch.</li>
            <li>I love the long lasting waves this product gives me, it leaves my hair looking gorgeous all day long.</li>
            <li>Such a cool curling iron!</li>
            <li>It is highly suspicious that ALL  these 5 star reviews are from unverified buyers who have all bought several of the same products, and every single one of their  reviews is &amp;#34;marvelous, wonderful, and perfect&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>it’s easy to forget to turn it off between being rushed, or a teen’s forgetfulness.</li>
            <li>The LCD digital display makes it easy to set the iron to 1 of 3 desired heat settings, timer settings, curling direction, and steam switch.</li>
            <li>Really easy and simple to use without the fear of burning yourself.</li>
            <li>She thanks me for this pretty much every time we plan to go out.</li>
            <li>Really easy and simple to use without the fear of burning yourself.</li>
            <li>I must say that all of the positive reviews on this product is what really sold me.</li>
            <li>Have fine blonde hair, that would never hold a curl longer than 2 hours.</li>
            <li>My fine blonde hair would not curl?  </li>
            <li>automatic curling as the main star, curling could not be any faster!</li>
            <li>The Miraqueen seems much better than her other hair things, and she’s very happy with it (which is really what matters)!&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, long story short, THANK YOU for helping this old man with his teenage daughter crisis.</li>
            <li>Purchased this for my wife a few months back, absolutely a great gift.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I would  highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>After a week, my hair is still straight and curly.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my wife and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>No curling iron has ever worked on my hair—the curls are always gone within a couple hours no matter how much hairspray I add.</li>
            <li>very easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>I have straight and stubborn hair.  </li>
            <li>It uses steam to help set the curls and the ceramic plates really minimize damage to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>won&#x27;t do much for my hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for yourself or a gift!</li>
            <li>It really works</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Miraqueen curling iron!</li>
            <li>the ceramic plates with steam gets me ready to go in the morning.</li>
            <li>I really tried to make this product work for me</li>
            <li>If you add to much hair it will tell you and unreel your hair without tangling it.</li>
            <li>After you get the hang of it, it is much faster then curling your hair with an iron.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I was trying to find one that was a reasonable price</li>
            <li>I give A++++ and reasonable price.</li>
            <li>For a non Shirley Temple look, straight iron ends and don&#x27;t start at crown of head.</li>
            <li>After you get the hang of it, it is much faster then curling your hair with an iron.</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>The Miraqueen Professional Steam Curling Wand combines beauty and science into a durable and useful styling tool.</li>
            <li>I have not had any hair get stuck in it, but have put too much in a couple of times.  </li>
            <li>The device just beeps to tell me there&#x27;s too much hair, and I remove some.  </li>
            <li>My hair would come out curly but it would be uneven and not look nice at all.</li>
            <li>The Miraqueen Professional Steam Curling Wand is definitely by far, MY FAVORITE curling iron thus far.</li>
            <li>Our friends are always asking her how she gets her curls so perfect, and after the first few days using it she has been thanking me at least once a day for it.</li>
            <li>that was worth more than the small fee of this curling iron.  </li>
            <li>When my cheap old curler went out on me a little bit before my best friend&#x27;s bday, I was not a happy camper -__-.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The steam technology with high heat really seems to set the hair well.  </li>
            <li>LED screen not only gives you a multitude of options, but they also let you give special attention to layering details on every part of your hair.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t write reviews for products but this curling iron is so amazing it deserves my time.</li>
            <li>The outside of the curling iron remains cool so there is no danger of getting burned.</li>
            <li>And if your like me and burn yourself all the time by accident the outside of this curler stays cool to the touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Miraqueen kept my hair curled for over six hours; a new record for this hair!</li>
            <li>Once all the hair is curled I mist lightly with hair spray and let dry.</li>
            <li>Less complaining, more curls, everybody wins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>MiraQueen is also light and easy to grasp, making those accidental drops less likely to happen and reduce fatigue.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know how many times I would go back to my house after leaving for work to double check if the iron was off.  </li>
            <li>The button are right next to the screen for easy access, and gets hot enough for lasting curls.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend watching the YouTube instructional videos before using.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and your hairdo is ready in less than 20 minutes - no need to go to the salon.</li>
            <li>This is the new age and new technology!</li>
            <li>I had been really wanting a steam curling iron for some time and my husband surprised me with one for Christmas.</li>
            <li>She was able to watch a few YouTube videos to figure everything out</li>
            <li>This actually turned out to be a fairly useful gift.</li>
            <li>personally think this curing iron is definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Normally I have to put a lot of product in my hair to get curl to set.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant about trying this curling iron because I&#x27;ve already wasted so much money on irons that are &amp;#34;guaranteed&amp;#34; to work and literally fall flat, but I&#x27;m so glad I gave this one a chance!</li>
            <li>My straight, awful hair came out full, wavy, and gorgeous, and I go so many compliments on it at my company&#x27;s holiday party--</li>
            <li>The curl that I did get was nice near my scalp then slowly loosened and practically straight at the ends.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve finally got an easy to use curling iron that&#x27;s durable and actually works!</li>
            <li>My wife spend far less time styling her hair, she  could not have asked for a better curling iron.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel my hair very soft and fluffy after doing my curls. :)</li>
            <li>However, this product was definitely the right choice for my look</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Miraqueen Professional Steam Curling Wand!</li>
            <li>I purchased a different Miraqueen curling product with alot of the same features found in this curling iron for my step-daughter who has very fine blonde hair</li>
            <li>I grab my hairspray quickly after curling my hair but it goes back to being straight 20 minutes later.</li>
            <li>My standard curling iron was becoming a real problem due to the length of my hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Miraqueen Professional Steam Curling Wand</li>
            <li>The iron is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>Does exactly the same work you want to do with this.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I remove each curl carefully and let cool.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and is ready to use in less than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, especially those with stick straight hair</li>
            <li>Although i will say my stubborn straight hair falls back down to non curly very quickly -</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend to other people in the market for a nice, low cost iron.  </li>
            <li>After I did some research and found out she was in need of a new curling iron, I went for the search and landed here to find the &amp;#34;Miraqueen Professional curling wand&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was a little afraid to try the Miraqueen at first, but I went ahead and tried it and the curls I got were beautiful, my hair didn&#x27;t feel damaged, and they stayed in all night without hairspray!</li>
            <li>This is the one product that we&#x27;ve found so far that easily achieves those results, no other iron has worked even half as well.</li>
            <li>My hair is so silky that when I use curling irons it goes back to being straight.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like what a professional salon would use.</li>
            <li>no problems so far.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the way my natural hair looks</li>
            <li>So far, I have had this iron for a couple weeks</li>
            <li>I bought another one on Amazon that nearly burned my hair.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I am purchasing this item and will leave an actual real review that is not paid for or coerced .This</li>
            <li>I recommend to anyone, young or old, looking for a full and long lasting curl.</li>
            <li>I got this as an early gift for Valentines Day</li>
            <li>Even if you don’t understand the science like me, you’ll appreciate the natural looking appearance and long-lasting curls that the Miraqueen Professional Steam Curling Wand evokes.</li>
            <li>It curls really fast but protects the hair, and this was an issue for me because I have a very fragile blond hair.</li>
            <li>I purchased it for my 13 year old granddaughter and she has no problem using it at all</li>
            <li>I got my girlfriend this as a gift recently and she absolutely loves it, and so do I.</li>
            <li>and I gotta say that I&#x27;m completely blown away by the quality of this product</li>
            <li>I also used Moroccan oil to make hair soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been natural for nine years now</li>
            <li>Until I received the Miraqueen Curling Iron for Christmas, I would always have to pay a ton of money just to have my hair professionally straightened and styled.  </li>
            <li>I have shoulder length, thick hair and this give me nice curls that last throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Yeah, I’m a guy writing this review, but I’m also a single father who loves his daughter very much.</li>
            <li>My hair is usually flat and doesn&#x27;t hold a curl, but this product helps my curls to stay in much longer</li>
            <li>- you can either let your hair out after the first beep for loose curls or after a couple beeps for tighter ones.</li>
            <li>The high tempature also allows my wife&#x27;s curls to last all day and night, no matter what the weather.</li>
            <li>and she raved about it; so when I found this new version of the same iron I knew I had to have it for myself.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I live in a very rural area in the Midwest, the nearest hair salon is approx.</li>
            <li>Apparently negative ions can stop the growth of bacteria in hair and also allow tiny water molecules to penetrate the hair shaft and seal the cuticle, which gives a healthy appearance to the tresses.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find the right hair curler for my dull and straight hair.</li>
            <li>I have super thick hair too, and this iron handled my course, thick hair just fine!</li>
            <li>Anyone with flat hair that normally doesn&#x27;t hold a curl should try this.</li>
            <li>I normally have naturally curly hair and when I used this curling iron, I did not even have to blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li>Since she’s a teacher she has to wake up very early just to get ready for school; now that has this curling wand, she has cut that time in half.</li>
            <li>Definitely works for fine, thin, straight hair..</li>
            <li>The fact that my hair would curl and steam at the same time leaving the finish product soft was mind blowing.</li>
            <li>I set it on the highest setting (450) for the longest time (12 seconds) and it BARELY curled.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Looking back at my old iron, I weep for all the time I lost when I could have been using this.</li>
            <li>Well, the excitement is about not having your hair damaged from overheating because The Miraqueen Professional Steam Curling Wand have 3 heat levels, 4 timer settings and as an extra precaution it has an auto power off.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a boost in your everyday hair-styling routine, this versatile product can provide exciting styling options.</li>
            <li>With a normal curling iron, even with products like hairspray, my curls only hold for maybe an hour after I finish before my hair falls flat again.</li>
            <li>I suggest if you have thick or curly hair that you straighten it as much as you can first, and only do 1/2 in sections at a time.</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair, so I was a little skeptical, but it certainly does its job.</li>
            <li>This curling iron is much easier to use and actually holds compared to my some of my other curling irons.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it if you&#x27;re lazy like me.</li>
            <li>I love that I can use the different heat setting to determine how formal I want the curls to look or to even create a messy texturized look for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>My hair is thin, fine, and color treated, so according to the product description it should curl with the lowest heat setting, but it barely curled even with the highest heat and longest timer setting.  </li>
            <li>and i am not sure about the little water on the top and how it helps</li>
            <li>PLUS my hair stays curly so much longer when I use the Miraqueen as opposed to a typical curling iron.</li>
            <li>I let my hair dry naturally and than I used it to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that it takes a lot less time to get ready every</li>
            <li>It cuts her time getting ready in half.</li>
            <li>The various settings are also amazing as sometimes I only want a slight curl while other times, usually when I go to parties, I want heavier curls.</li>
            <li>And as another previous reviewer stated, many of the very glowing reviews here are fake.</li>
            <li>my hair doesn&#x27;t get super dry, brittle, or crunchy like the curling iron I had in the past.</li>

            <li> But my favorite thing is the timer settings.</li>

            <li> I never knew the role ions have in creating healthy looking hair, but the women in my family told me how important they are.</li>
            <li> greatest thing about this iron is how it makes your hair smooth and shiny, even if you&#x27;re using it after a long day, it smooths it out and makes it so silky soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a GREAT tool, it works smoothly, simply, and super safe!</li>
            <li> The Miraqueen is a dream come true!</li>
            <li> This is especially great because we have 3 kids, and with 2 full-time working parents, it cuts down on the most important commodity that we have: time.</li>
            <li> So we&#x27;ve been looking for quality products that are easy to learn and use.</li>
            <li> You can easily create the look with this curling wand.</li>

            <li> This is the only time I&#x27;ve posted a review for something I did not buy for myself, but it&#x27;s because the product is deserving of all five stars, if just for the happiness</li>
            <li> but with this curling iron, it looks almost as strong as it did in the morning.</li>
            <li> This intense heat, plus the ions and the steam the wand generates, means you can come up with some very creative hairstyles.</li>
            <li> This iron gives me the beautiful curly look that I wanted and they actually last all through the night when I am at my gatherings.</li>
            <li> Not only did it give me perfect and consistent curls</li>

            <li> control buttons are also placed nicely, and the Light up screen is easy to read - no confusing configurations or displays - just a nice simple and easy to use iron!!</li>
            <li> My hair did not ever really hold a curl but this iron is amazing and gets my hair done quickly!</li>
            <li> Definitely give this a try, makes a great gift for any women in your life.</li>
            <li> The timer is great, because it won&#x27;t let you burn your hair off and, depending on what temperature you use, the curl will come out differently.</li>
            <li> So I finally decided to invest in the Miraqeen, and I&#x27;m SO HAPPY that I did.</li>
            <li> It brings fantastic results.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic.</li>
            <li> But, it gives great, lasting curls</li>
            <li> In addition, there’s a 360 degree swivel cord so you can move about freely while you’re curling your hair.</li>
            <li> It keeps my curls frizz free and shiny</li>
            <li> Great value, would definitely recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> The best part is that my curls last whole day.</li>
            <li> For professional grade hair curling, the Miraqueen Professional Steam Curling Wand is an excellent choice.</li>
            <li> I am left with beautiful hair that is full of body and shine.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so straight that even with the best hair products on the market, within thirty minutes it is as flat as a washboard.</li>
            <li> so the different heat settings come in very handy for the two of us.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations based on the reviews here, but my wife ultimately didn&#x27;t find this to be as awesome as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Quick and easy curls.</li>
            <li> super easy to use.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is super easy to use.</li>
            <li> The design makes it quick and easy to get a curly look</li>
            <li> This curling iron is super easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love it very much.</li>
            <li> The price is worth it!</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s exactly what I got and MORE.</li>
            <li> It heats up really quickly and it gets very hot!</li>
            <li> My hair never holds a curl,  but the steam setting makes mine last for a good 16 hours with a light spray rather than caking it on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thanks so much for making this professional curling iron in that I truly enjoy using it and love the manual settings.&amp;#60; My hair never dries in that you can set the heat levels.&amp;#60; :) God bless!</li>
            <li> The LCD screen is so easy to read and this curling iron has three heat levels and the timer insures you get the right curl every time.</li>
            <li> Works OK, but certainly does not curl as well as promised no matter what settings are used.</li>
            <li> but I just couldn&#x27;t find the right technique for my hair!</li>
            <li> I have poofy frizzy hair and this tames my hair into beautiful, soft professional looking curls.</li>
            <li> I love it so much</li>
            <li> Curls thick hair beautifully!</li>
            <li> My curls indeed come out full and bouncy.</li>
            <li> and I don’t have to wait forever because I want to be able to use it when I’M READY to use it.</li>
            <li> I love this product and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> and It&#x27;s easy to use and makes the curls look more natural.</li>
            <li> You absolutely must wear the mitt because this thing gets HOT!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome, no more &amp;#34;hickey&amp;#34; burns!</li>
            <li> It works well, does the job quickly, and doesn&#x27;t burn my hair.</li>
            <li> It heats up so quickly</li>
            <li> Whether you want a low maintenance style or a more sophisticated look, the Miraqueen steam waver can deliver the style you&#x27;re after without damaging your hair.</li>
            <li> I might not be the type to use this product on my hair everyday, but it&#x27;s a LIFESAVER for special occasions, and it works perfectly for even the least experienced at styling hair.</li>
            <li> But I do have to go out and look nice a few times a year, and my hair is straight as a poker (NOT in a good way).</li>
            <li> I purchased the curling iron for my daughter, I purchased one a few months ago and loved it so much and was loving the compliments on how my hair looked.</li>
            <li> so I don’t burn the counter or in that case (the HOUSE) down, lol.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s her new favorite tool for her hair</li>
            <li> This is my favorite new tool in the beauty routine.</li>
            <li> Long or short hair turns out beautifully!</li>
            <li> Miraqueen never fails to impress!</li>
            <li> This curling iron looks so pretty!</li>
            <li> I was worried at first about purchasing this product because, I have tried everything else!</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life I can style my hair!</li>
            <li> Miraqueen is easy to use and provides many different options for curl styles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This model makes the entire process so easy (no to mention safe...</li>
            <li> Did not work at all right out of the box quick refund tho</li>
            <li> Did not work for my fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li> You cannot take a huge or even a large chunk of hair.</li>
            <li> is of professional standard and has lots of great features.</li>
            <li> This works like a dream and having a selection of temps, steam and different times gives a nice variety of curl.</li>
            <li> Looks fun to operate.</li>
            <li> She curled her hair on her own with no problem, and the curls lasted the entire day!</li>
            <li> so fun to use.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a nice visual to have.  </li>
            <li> Its definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really worth</li>
            <li> told, the Miraqueen works better, quicker and more efficiently than any other curling iron I have ever had.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hard to read the setting and to find out the temperature because of the easy to read LED screen.  </li>
            <li> and you can set the timer length, temperature, even the direction of the curl right on the screen.</li>
            <li> I took this with me to my trip right after I got it in the mail.</li>
            <li> Yea right.</li>
            <li> I probably didnt use it right.</li>
            <li> It was her first curling iron and I&#x27;ve never seen her more excited to try a present.</li>
            <li> The LCD display is easy to use, in fact the whole unit is easy to use in general.  </li>
            <li> It came to me defective.. bought a new one from sallys ( red one ),works good.</li>
            <li> I wear my hair in many different styles, but so far all my friends say that my beach waves is their favorite hairstyle.</li>
            <li> The loose waves is also my favorite style!</li>
            <li> I have thicker,longer hair and this Iron curls my hair super fast</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have time to look up videos on how to use it, but I was surprised on how easy it was to use.</li>
            <li> I find it very sketchy that all these people bought 4 or 5 of the same items and all gave them amazing reviews.</li>
            <li> SUPER FAST SHIPPING!!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> An easy to use curling wand that leaves hair with a professional finish look.  </li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and ready to go.</li>
            <li> It does get hot quick, so you have to act fast while using it.</li>
            <li> She has very straight hair, that used to never curl</li>
            <li> Does a professional job and quick!</li>
            <li> She also loves hot</li>
            <li> Since I attend numerous gatherings and birthday parties with my friends during this time of the year, I wanted to make sure that I look presentable for my outings this time around</li>
            <li> It makes great curls that last long.</li>
            <li> Although it works better using smaller section of hair</li>
            <li> With the Miraqueen, the heat distribution is pretty even so</li>
            <li> I really love all the different features and settings it has to offer.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> and I love all the different options and settings.</li>
            <li> Over all the wand is well worth the cost, it seems like it is very well made.</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> I love that the heating setting goes all the way up to 450 degrees because, at times, I have the frizziest hair and low level heating settings</li>
            <li> I know some people might say higher the temperature</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s durable, safe and a high-quality product that actually lives up to the hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommend for anyone interested in glowing, wavy hair that turns heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried steam rollers, hot rollers and curling iron and although they do work for about the first hour, but curls always come out</li>
            <li> This curling iron is a lot better for me than traditional curling irons.</li>
            <li> I thought I had a favorite, but after borrowing this model from my sister on a recent vacation, I realized I had been settling!</li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> The  Miraqueen Professional Steam Curling Wand is a curling wand with a ceramic chamber for a smooth curling experience.  </li>
            <li> It has the ability to curl even the most stubborn hair within a short period of time.</li>
            <li> I can definitely say this was one of the better Christmas gifts I&#x27;ve gotten.</li>
            <li> Your hair zips into the heating chambers, and after mere seconds, your perfect curls will come bouncing out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that I have unruly hair.  </li>
            <li> great when I&#x27;m running late and forget to unplug it.  </li>
            <li> you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also beeps when it&#x27;s ready to use, and at the right temp - you can also set the desired time for use, and it will beep when done prompting you to release the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even for a newbie that can barely brush her hair, this iron is SO EASY to use.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product because the curls last a long time and in my opinion it is a very awesome curler!</li>
            <li> Bought this to upgrade my current curling iron that lasted a good 2 years before it finally gave in.  </li>
            <li> but this is so much easier and gives way better curls that last!</li>
            <li> Besides allowing me to have beautiful curls that last, the ceramic materials don&#x27;t damage my hair and the timer keeps me from worrying that I will burn the house down.</li>
            <li> I have long straight - VERY FINE - hair.</li>
            <li> I have very straight hair with a straight perm and it still works,</li>
            <li> I love that it is not just a hot dry plate.</li>
            <li> but i like it as long as it lasts :)</li>
            <li> I just love it , I can curl my long hair and the curl stays in for days .</li>
            <li> In fact, if my hair is not in a ponytail, it&#x27;s pretty much a miracle.</li>
            <li> First off, this curling iron is FAST to heat up.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and hot.  </li>
            <li> The curls, as she says, stay for a long period of time, and much more.</li>
            <li> Last month, I was looking to give my sister a good lasting gift for her birthday and knew any hair care products would be much appreciated.</li>
            <li> All the heating and curling action occurs within the head of the device, leaving the outsides cool to touch.</li>
            <li> I love the long lasting waves this product gives me, it leaves my hair looking gorgeous all day long.</li>
            <li> Such a cool curling iron!</li>
            <li> It is highly suspicious that ALL  these 5 star reviews are from unverified buyers who have all bought several of the same products, and every single one of their  reviews is &amp;#34;marvelous, wonderful, and perfect&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> it’s easy to forget to turn it off between being rushed, or a teen’s forgetfulness.</li>
            <li> The LCD digital display makes it easy to set the iron to 1 of 3 desired heat settings, timer settings, curling direction, and steam switch.</li>
            <li> Really easy and simple to use without the fear of burning yourself.</li>
            <li> She thanks me for this pretty much every time we plan to go out.</li>
            <li> Really easy and simple to use without the fear of burning yourself.</li>
            <li> I must say that all of the positive reviews on this product is what really sold me.</li>
            <li> Have fine blonde hair, that would never hold a curl longer than 2 hours.</li>
            <li> My fine blonde hair would not curl?  </li>
            <li> automatic curling as the main star, curling could not be any faster!</li>
            <li> The Miraqueen seems much better than her other hair things, and she’s very happy with it (which is really what matters)!&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, long story short, THANK YOU for helping this old man with his teenage daughter crisis.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my wife a few months back, absolutely a great gift.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I would  highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> After a week, my hair is still straight and curly.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> No curling iron has ever worked on my hair—the curls are always gone within a couple hours no matter how much hairspray I add.</li>
            <li> very easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I have straight and stubborn hair.  </li>
            <li> It uses steam to help set the curls and the ceramic plates really minimize damage to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t do much for my hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for yourself or a gift!</li>
            <li> It really works</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Miraqueen curling iron!</li>
            <li> the ceramic plates with steam gets me ready to go in the morning.</li>
            <li> I really tried to make this product work for me</li>
            <li> If you add to much hair it will tell you and unreel your hair without tangling it.</li>
            <li> After you get the hang of it, it is much faster then curling your hair with an iron.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I was trying to find one that was a reasonable price</li>
            <li> I give A++++ and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> For a non Shirley Temple look, straight iron ends and don&#x27;t start at crown of head.</li>
            <li> After you get the hang of it, it is much faster then curling your hair with an iron.</li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> The Miraqueen Professional Steam Curling Wand combines beauty and science into a durable and useful styling tool.</li>
            <li> I have not had any hair get stuck in it, but have put too much in a couple of times.  </li>
            <li> The device just beeps to tell me there&#x27;s too much hair, and I remove some.  </li>
            <li> My hair would come out curly but it would be uneven and not look nice at all.</li>
            <li> The Miraqueen Professional Steam Curling Wand is definitely by far, MY FAVORITE curling iron thus far.</li>
            <li> Our friends are always asking her how she gets her curls so perfect, and after the first few days using it she has been thanking me at least once a day for it.</li>
            <li> that was worth more than the small fee of this curling iron.  </li>
            <li> When my cheap old curler went out on me a little bit before my best friend&#x27;s bday, I was not a happy camper -__-.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The steam technology with high heat really seems to set the hair well.  </li>
            <li> LED screen not only gives you a multitude of options, but they also let you give special attention to layering details on every part of your hair.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews for products but this curling iron is so amazing it deserves my time.</li>
            <li> The outside of the curling iron remains cool so there is no danger of getting burned.</li>
            <li> And if your like me and burn yourself all the time by accident the outside of this curler stays cool to the touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Miraqueen kept my hair curled for over six hours; a new record for this hair!</li>
            <li> Once all the hair is curled I mist lightly with hair spray and let dry.</li>
            <li> Less complaining, more curls, everybody wins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> MiraQueen is also light and easy to grasp, making those accidental drops less likely to happen and reduce fatigue.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know how many times I would go back to my house after leaving for work to double check if the iron was off.  </li>
            <li> The button are right next to the screen for easy access, and gets hot enough for lasting curls.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend watching the YouTube instructional videos before using.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and your hairdo is ready in less than 20 minutes - no need to go to the salon.</li>
            <li> This is the new age and new technology!</li>
            <li> I had been really wanting a steam curling iron for some time and my husband surprised me with one for Christmas.</li>
            <li> She was able to watch a few YouTube videos to figure everything out</li>
            <li> This actually turned out to be a fairly useful gift.</li>
            <li> personally think this curing iron is definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Normally I have to put a lot of product in my hair to get curl to set.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about trying this curling iron because I&#x27;ve already wasted so much money on irons that are &amp;#34;guaranteed&amp;#34; to work and literally fall flat, but I&#x27;m so glad I gave this one a chance!</li>
            <li> My straight, awful hair came out full, wavy, and gorgeous, and I go so many compliments on it at my company&#x27;s holiday party--</li>
            <li> The curl that I did get was nice near my scalp then slowly loosened and practically straight at the ends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally got an easy to use curling iron that&#x27;s durable and actually works!</li>
            <li> My wife spend far less time styling her hair, she  could not have asked for a better curling iron.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel my hair very soft and fluffy after doing my curls. :)</li>
            <li> However, this product was definitely the right choice for my look</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Miraqueen Professional Steam Curling Wand!</li>
            <li> I purchased a different Miraqueen curling product with alot of the same features found in this curling iron for my step-daughter who has very fine blonde hair</li>
            <li> I grab my hairspray quickly after curling my hair but it goes back to being straight 20 minutes later.</li>
            <li> My standard curling iron was becoming a real problem due to the length of my hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Miraqueen Professional Steam Curling Wand</li>
            <li> The iron is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> Does exactly the same work you want to do with this.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I remove each curl carefully and let cool.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and is ready to use in less than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, especially those with stick straight hair</li>
            <li> Although i will say my stubborn straight hair falls back down to non curly very quickly -</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend to other people in the market for a nice, low cost iron.  </li>
            <li> After I did some research and found out she was in need of a new curling iron, I went for the search and landed here to find the &amp;#34;Miraqueen Professional curling wand&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a little afraid to try the Miraqueen at first, but I went ahead and tried it and the curls I got were beautiful, my hair didn&#x27;t feel damaged, and they stayed in all night without hairspray!</li>
            <li> This is the one product that we&#x27;ve found so far that easily achieves those results, no other iron has worked even half as well.</li>
            <li> My hair is so silky that when I use curling irons it goes back to being straight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like what a professional salon would use.</li>
            <li> no problems so far.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the way my natural hair looks</li>
            <li> So far, I have had this iron for a couple weeks</li>
            <li> I bought another one on Amazon that nearly burned my hair.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I am purchasing this item and will leave an actual real review that is not paid for or coerced .This</li>
            <li> I recommend to anyone, young or old, looking for a full and long lasting curl.</li>
            <li> I got this as an early gift for Valentines Day</li>
            <li> Even if you don’t understand the science like me, you’ll appreciate the natural looking appearance and long-lasting curls that the Miraqueen Professional Steam Curling Wand evokes.</li>
            <li> It curls really fast but protects the hair, and this was an issue for me because I have a very fragile blond hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased it for my 13 year old granddaughter and she has no problem using it at all</li>
            <li> I got my girlfriend this as a gift recently and she absolutely loves it, and so do I.</li>
            <li> and I gotta say that I&#x27;m completely blown away by the quality of this product</li>
            <li> I also used Moroccan oil to make hair soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for nine years now</li>
            <li> Until I received the Miraqueen Curling Iron for Christmas, I would always have to pay a ton of money just to have my hair professionally straightened and styled.  </li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, thick hair and this give me nice curls that last throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Yeah, I’m a guy writing this review, but I’m also a single father who loves his daughter very much.</li>
            <li> My hair is usually flat and doesn&#x27;t hold a curl, but this product helps my curls to stay in much longer</li>
            <li> - you can either let your hair out after the first beep for loose curls or after a couple beeps for tighter ones.</li>
            <li> The high tempature also allows my wife&#x27;s curls to last all day and night, no matter what the weather.</li>
            <li> and she raved about it; so when I found this new version of the same iron I knew I had to have it for myself.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I live in a very rural area in the Midwest, the nearest hair salon is approx.</li>
            <li> Apparently negative ions can stop the growth of bacteria in hair and also allow tiny water molecules to penetrate the hair shaft and seal the cuticle, which gives a healthy appearance to the tresses.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find the right hair curler for my dull and straight hair.</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair too, and this iron handled my course, thick hair just fine!</li>
            <li> Anyone with flat hair that normally doesn&#x27;t hold a curl should try this.</li>
            <li> I normally have naturally curly hair and when I used this curling iron, I did not even have to blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> Since she’s a teacher she has to wake up very early just to get ready for school; now that has this curling wand, she has cut that time in half.</li>
            <li> Definitely works for fine, thin, straight hair..</li>
            <li> The fact that my hair would curl and steam at the same time leaving the finish product soft was mind blowing.</li>
            <li> I set it on the highest setting (450) for the longest time (12 seconds) and it BARELY curled.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Looking back at my old iron, I weep for all the time I lost when I could have been using this.</li>
            <li> Well, the excitement is about not having your hair damaged from overheating because The Miraqueen Professional Steam Curling Wand have 3 heat levels, 4 timer settings and as an extra precaution it has an auto power off.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a boost in your everyday hair-styling routine, this versatile product can provide exciting styling options.</li>
            <li> With a normal curling iron, even with products like hairspray, my curls only hold for maybe an hour after I finish before my hair falls flat again.</li>
            <li> I suggest if you have thick or curly hair that you straighten it as much as you can first, and only do 1/2 in sections at a time.</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair, so I was a little skeptical, but it certainly does its job.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is much easier to use and actually holds compared to my some of my other curling irons.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it if you&#x27;re lazy like me.</li>
            <li> I love that I can use the different heat setting to determine how formal I want the curls to look or to even create a messy texturized look for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin, fine, and color treated, so according to the product description it should curl with the lowest heat setting, but it barely curled even with the highest heat and longest timer setting.  </li>
            <li> and i am not sure about the little water on the top and how it helps</li>
            <li> PLUS my hair stays curly so much longer when I use the Miraqueen as opposed to a typical curling iron.</li>
            <li> I let my hair dry naturally and than I used it to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that it takes a lot less time to get ready every</li>
            <li> It cuts her time getting ready in half.</li>
            <li> The various settings are also amazing as sometimes I only want a slight curl while other times, usually when I go to parties, I want heavier curls.</li>
            <li> And as another previous reviewer stated, many of the very glowing reviews here are fake.</li>
            <li> my hair doesn&#x27;t get super dry, brittle, or crunchy like the curling iron I had in the past.</li>
            <li> have long hair that is both very thick, yet fine.</li>
            <li> Naturally, I was extremely hesitant to pay $130 for a curling iron.</li>
            <li> After I curl it, an hour later it will fall flat again.</li>
            <li> I have stubborn, very straight hair that has a hard time holding curl.</li>
            <li> have also had a problem in the past with irons that heated some parts of my hair too much and others not enough.</li>
            <li> but they didn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> the curls last for a long time.</li>
            <li> and they last all day long.</li>
            <li> I have coarse thick straight hair that never curls with my standard curling irons.</li>
            <li> I mean really hot</li>
            <li> and she has a new project everyday, and she is smiling again,</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty long and thick so maybe that&#x27;s the issue.</li>
            <li> I have had other products &#x27;promise&#x27; to curl my hair for all day results, only to have my hair fall back flat in a couple hours.  </li>
            <li> I have long, really thick hair, and it only takes me 20 minutes to do my whole head.  </li>
            <li> Curls like an iron worth twice as much, I mean, it even has a timer!</li>
            <li> two hours from where my house is, so I knew that option was out because I don&#x27;t drive long distances.</li>
            <li> so you don’t have to wait for long.</li>
            <li> it takes a long time to curl it all.</li>
            <li> The four timer settings and the automatic shutoff feature give you the peace of mind that you’re not going make a mistake and leave it on too long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used a wand or a curling iron on my long hair.</li>
            <li> My hair long, thick and straight, it will not curl without kilograms of product in it.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long hair and the new steam technology added to this curling iron produced soft, bouncy, long-lasting curls for me with ease.</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give 5 stars is due to design.</li>
            <li> No more manual wrapping of the hair around old school curling irons!</li>
            <li> She is not naturally curly but with this Miraqueen she is now!  </li>
            <li> The Miraqueen works like a charm, the steam creates moisture so her hair doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li> this curling iron doesn&#x27;t damage hair like other curling products tend to, as the steam mist moisturizes as it curls, and the curls last all day, every single time!</li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t buy curling wands, because I&#x27;ve had so many bad experiences in the past.</li>
            <li> and she said she always wanted loose wavy curls.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually have time to style my hair, but recently I had a couple of big events</li>
            <li> Ever feel like your arms are screaming at you after only doing half of your hair?</li>
            <li> This also doesn&#x27;t dry out her hair like other curling irons used to.  </li>
            <li> My wife has owned many curling irons and has been  frustrated with the results.</li>
            <li> Generally in the past after curling my hair, the curls would tend to lose shape within a couple of hours, no matter what products</li>
            <li> I bought my wife the Miraqueen steam curing wand for her birthday a few months back</li>
            <li> This product is a total waste of time and money.  </li>
            <li> Ironically I still recommend miraqueen, just not for the inexperienced.</li>
            <li> The heat allows the curls to last for a few days.</li>
            <li> After that the choices are endless, I use a wide tooth comb to loosen the curls into softer curls, fluff a bit, spray and go.  </li>
            <li> Average, everyday curling and flat irons did nothing but damage my hair, leaving it frizzy and dry.  </li>
            <li> i finish my hair in less than half the time as your traditional curling irons.</li>
            <li> I dry my hair upside down to give fullness to the crown and then use the Miraqueen to curl the length.</li>
            <li> Maybe this takes more practice, but I&#x27;m a little concerned that after a day&#x27;s use the motor is making an unpleasant mechanical noise.</li>
            <li> I have straight thick hair and usually by the end of the day, you can&#x27;t tell I curled anything</li>
            <li> The LED screen is unlike any other curling iron I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li> Bonus feature is the auto shut off, my other iron didn&#x27;t have that</li>
            <li> My favorite rollers died and are no longer sold :(</li>
            <li> (unlike other products I have had in</li>
            <li> They are all also within 1 week of each other.</li>
            <li> No more burning myself with the traditional curling</li>
            <li> I have only been using it a few days and my hair&#x27;s volume and bounce are like night and day!</li>
            <li> happens with some of the other curling irons like this that are made by other brands.</li>
            <li> hair crimps, other curling irons</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> It only accepts a small amount of hair each time.</li>
            <li> It can only be used with a certain side towards the head  and makes for a bit of awkward holding of the machine.</li>
            <li> I was so tired of looking at my straight hair style that I knew it was time to invest instead of waste another $12-$40 on a curling iron that wouldn&#x27;t give me what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I have thick THICK curly hair that goes past my shoulders and would normally take 1.5 hrs to curl with a standard iron.</li>
            <li> Usually by the last few curls I&#x27;m getting impatient and if there&#x27;s no timer I don&#x27;t hold them in as long.</li>
            <li> No more bad hair days and more peace of mind.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> My straight hair is about down to my tush and it is incredibly difficult to get a curl and keep it.</li>
            <li> I am usually down within 10 minutes or so.</li>
            <li> (I personally am too lazy for those!).</li>
            <li> and my hair wasn&#x27;t dry like it usually is when I use my curling iron.</li>
            <li> She has a few other curling irons and was always complaining about how they never worked.</li>
            <li> I know less than nothing about beauty and things like hair styles are beyond me.</li>
            <li> so you can cut curl time in half.</li>
            <li> Having long hair it is hard to maintain the health and shiny</li>
            <li> My hair is so thick and long</li>
            <li> You basically put your hair into it and control the temp (based on how tight you want the curls).</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want too tight of curls.</li>
            <li> I did a bunch of my friend&#x27;s little sister&#x27;s hair for a party with this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit I was a little terrified to use this, but after I read a billion reviews I thought I&#x27;d take a chance.  </li>
            <li> It came in a few days.</li>
            <li> and I curl my hair almost everyday.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> And after a few seconds of playing around with it my hair got stuck in this thing</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> BUT not after it got caught a few times</li>
            <li> I had mentioned to my mom a few weeks before Christmas how I wanted a steamer for my hair.</li>
            <li> And a few seconds around face.</li>
            <li> The curling iron was to heavy for me</li>
            <li> Before, she just did her hair with different things and then went to school, but she was very frustrated that she hadn&#x27;t found the right hair iron.</li>
            <li> My hair is less than shoulder length and it makes the cutest curls for my hair as well!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty lazy, terrible at curling my own hair, and I usually wouldn&#x27;t take the time to curl it in the mornings, but with this it&#x27;s impossible to mess up the curls</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s not easy for a beginner.</li>
            <li> and I just about had a heart attack (I did lose a little chunk of hair, but no more then i would have pulled out styling otherwise).  </li>
            <li> I usually have to use the highest heat setting on curling irons</li>
            <li> And no more burning myself, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> Even with small amounts of hair, the machine would beep and reverse a bit.  </li>
            <li> The timer makes the curls fool proof, and keeps me from burning my hair, which is what usually happens.</li>
            <li> however I am not sure</li>
            <li> Have purchased in the past and purchased again with no hesitation.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t usually curl my hair, but now with this one that isn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
            <li> , small wave there.</li>
            <li> Curling irons are a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> Lately, I have been obsessed with the big curly hair look, so that was the look that I was going for this year.</li>
            <li> The Miraqueen not only straightens my hair with ease, it actually maintains the moisture needed in my hair without annoying frizz.  </li>
            <li> mess!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m admittedly clumsy and have hurt myself in the past.</li>
            <li> It does wonders for my thick, hard to manage hair.</li>
            <li> It will take at least 10 minutes to curl. .</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair and the curling iron does wonders.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair and the curling iron does wonders.</li>
            <li> The other reviews must be fake.  </li>
            <li> No more burns on your face, forehead or fingers!</li>
            <li> NO more doubts, give it a try!</li>
            <li> I have such thick hair and have always found curls very difficult to stay put.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to leave it on too long.</li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed with this curler!</li>
            <li> Also, I share it with my sister who has very thick hair.</li>
            <li> Instruction are not great</li>
            <li> If you are timid at all, or not experienced with styling your hair</li>
            <li> I just received this 5 minutes ago and the dropper is broken like someone stepped on it.  </li>
            <li> Worked with her thin hair and didn&#x27;t harm it at all.</li>
            <li> She has very thin, hard to manage hair.</li>
            <li> I needed a curling iron badly and this never dries my hair like the other one I&#x27;ve used for years.</li>
            <li> It is unfair for me to judge, bc daughter decided to return it.  </li>
            <li> However, I get bored with my hair as it is quite often.</li>
            <li> anything EVER does go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s soooo difficult to do by myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong buying this.</li>
            <li> Disappointing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always afraid I&#x27;m going to burn myself</li>
            <li> I know people are very skeptical about this product</li>
            <li> How badly was this package treated for this to happen?  </li>
            <li> A friend gave me this curling iron because she knows how frustrated I have been trying to get curly hair.</li>
            <li> So disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> Returning it :(</li>
            <li> I was shocked!  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed, I can guarantee you that!</li>
            <li> This thing is awful.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wished for curly and even got a perm years ago, but when perms grow out they look horrible and vowed never to do it again.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>

            <li> This is an amazing curling iron. My hair is so silky that when I use curling irons it goes back to being straight. I grab my hairspray quickly after curling my hair but it goes back to being straight 20 minutes later. This curling iron is much easier to use and actually holds compared to my some of my other curling irons. Miraqueen never fails to impress! The price is worth it!</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my wife a few months back, absolutely a great gift. She has a few other curling irons and was always complaining about how they never worked. The Miraqueen works like a charm, the steam creates moisture so her hair doesn&#x27;t dry out. The high tempature also allows my wife&#x27;s curls to last all day and night, no matter what the weather. Definitely give this a try, makes a great gift for any women in your life.</li>
            <li> Me and my sister love this curling iron! The story is that I bought this curler for my sister for her birthday as I saw all the good reviews.She ended up loving it and told me to get one for myself. I fell in love with how it leaves my hair! I would totally recommend this curler to anyone!</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve finally got an easy to use curling iron that&#x27;s durable and actually works! The LED screen is unlike any other curling iron I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife. She has hair that has sensitivity to the drying heat of traditional curling irons. She loves how this one uses steam to set the curls. She also loves hot the ceramic chamber curls her hair. It&#x27;s like what a professional salon would use.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is one of the best things I have have purchased this year.  Heats up quickly, doesn&#x27;t fry my hair, and curcls perfectly.  My favorite part is that it arrived quickly, cheap, and is easy to hold and tote to work with me.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My wife has owned many curling irons and has been  frustrated with the results. She was hesitant  to buy another,  but decided to give this one a trial.  To her delight it does a great curling job. No more bad hair days and more peace of mind.&lt;br /&gt;It is of professional standard and has lots of great features. The led screen is a beauty and you can set the timer length, temperature, even the direction of the curl right on the screen. This curling iron Miraqueen was design with the user in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Miraqueen for making this product. My wife spend far less time styling her hair, she  could not have asked for a better curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I highly recommend the Miraqueen Professional Steam Curling Wand</li>
            <li> Love this! My hair did not ever really hold a curl but this iron is amazing and gets my hair done quickly!</li>
            <li> So easy to use! I love the ease of use and the curls come out perfect - you can either let your hair out after the first beep for loose curls or after a couple beeps for tighter ones. So simple to set up and use and i am not sure about the little water on the top and how it helps but mayeb thats how my hair is preserved. Although i will say my stubborn straight hair falls back down to non curly very quickly - but i like it as long as it lasts :)</li>
            <li> I just love it , I can curl my long hair and the curl stays in for days . Best tool I have purchased in a long time .</li>
            <li> I have thicker,longer hair and this Iron curls my hair super fast and it looks great.I usually have to use the highest heat setting on curling irons and It&#x27;s easy to use and makes the curls look more natural.I would definitely recommend this product !</li>
            <li> Honestly speaking i have been through tons of curling irons for my entertainment shows but none have done the job likwe this one. Does the job, and i want to buy one for the rest of my family! Get it now!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my girlfriend. She had been needing a curling iron for a while, and this one had several great reviews, and for good reason. She could not be happier with it! Our friends are always asking her how she gets her curls so perfect, and after the first few days using it she has been thanking me at least once a day for it. This is the only time I&#x27;ve posted a review for something I did not buy for myself, but it&#x27;s because the product is deserving of all five stars, if just for the happiness it&#x27;s brought my Megan. :)</li>
            <li> Great curling iron that gives consistent results.  Heats quickly, curls nicely, no problems so far.  Bonus feature is the auto shut off, my other iron didn&#x27;t have that and I don&#x27;t know how many times I would go back to my house after leaving for work to double check if the iron was off.  I would definitely recommend to other people in the market for a nice, low cost iron.  Very pleased customer!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. It came in a few days. Box and packaging was great. The curling iron is great! The curls are so bouncy and not frizzy like with some curling irons. Very easy to use. I highly recommend. Great product!</li>
            <li> Did not work for my fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased a different Miraqueen curling product with alot of the same features found in this curling iron for my step-daughter who has very fine blonde hair and she raved about it; so when I found this new version of the same iron I knew I had to have it for myself. I have very thick, long hair and the new steam technology added to this curling iron produced soft, bouncy, long-lasting curls for me with ease. I&#x27;ve never had a curling iron that gave me curls with such staying power. I recommend watching the Youtube videos for how to use this properly. They help alot. All in all, I am super-impressed with this curling iron and highly recommend it for every woman wanting beautiful curls.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift from a friend and it&#x27;s wonderful. I&#x27;m pretty lazy, terrible at curling my own hair, and I usually wouldn&#x27;t take the time to curl it in the mornings, but with this it&#x27;s impossible to mess up the curls and I curl my hair almost everyday. The timer is great, because it won&#x27;t let you burn your hair off and, depending on what temperature you use, the curl will come out differently. I have shoulder length, thick hair and this give me nice curls that last throughout the day. Definitely worth it if you&#x27;re lazy like me.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. I don&#x27;t like the way my natural hair looks so my options are to either straighten it or curl it. I have no problem straightening, however, I had no luck with curling wands. My hair would come out curly but it would be uneven and not look nice at all. I almost gave up on curling my hair until I saw this product. It&#x27;s obviously very different from a curling wand so I decided to give it a shot. Once I got the hang of it, I got the most beautiful curls! I love how fool-proof this product is for me. And no more burning myself, which is a plus. Even if curling wands work for you, I say give this thing a try, you might love it even more; I know I did.</li>
            <li> So let me start off by saying that I&#x27;m NOT a girlie girl. In fact, if my hair is not in a ponytail, it&#x27;s pretty much a miracle. But I do have to go out and look nice a few times a year, and my hair is straight as a poker (NOT in a good way). So I finally decided to invest in the Miraqeen, and I&#x27;m SO HAPPY that I did. Even for a newbie that can barely brush her hair, this iron is SO EASY to use. My straight, awful hair came out full, wavy, and gorgeous, and I go so many compliments on it at my company&#x27;s holiday party-- and all without a ton of work or hassle. I also like how after I use the Miraqueen my hair doesn&#x27;t get super dry, brittle, or crunchy like the curling iron I had in the past. PLUS my hair stays curly so much longer when I use the Miraqueen as opposed to a typical curling iron. I might not be the type to use this product on my hair everyday, but it&#x27;s a LIFESAVER for special occasions, and it works perfectly for even the least experienced at styling hair. LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Yeah, I’m a guy writing this review, but I’m also a single father who loves his daughter very much. I&#x27;ve been going out of my mind trying to help her move into her teenage stage, hair just isn&#x27;t my thing. Before, she just did her hair with different things and then went to school, but she was very frustrated that she hadn&#x27;t found the right hair iron. So we&#x27;ve been looking for quality products that are easy to learn and use. She has very straight hair, that used to never curl and she said she always wanted loose wavy curls. This is the one product that we&#x27;ve found so far that easily achieves those results, no other iron has worked even half as well. She was able to watch a few YouTube videos to figure everything out and then it worked like a charm! Curls like an iron worth twice as much, I mean, it even has a timer! It heats up quickly and is ready to use in less than 2 minutes. The Miraqueen seems much better than her other hair things, and she’s very happy with it (which is really what matters)!&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, long story short, THANK YOU for helping this old man with his teenage daughter crisis.</li>
            <li> Steam stopped working after 1 use.</li>
            <li> This actually turned out to be a fairly useful gift. I did a bunch of my friend&#x27;s little sister&#x27;s hair for a party with this and they loved the results!</li>
            <li> Since I attend numerous gatherings and birthday parties with my friends during this time of the year, I wanted to make sure that I look presentable for my outings this time around (lol, you never know if you might meet that special someone). Lately, I have been obsessed with the big curly hair look, so that was the look that I was going for this year. When my cheap old curler went out on me a little bit before my best friend&#x27;s bday, I was not a happy camper -__-.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I live in a very rural area in the Midwest, the nearest hair salon is approx. two hours from where my house is, so I knew that option was out because I don&#x27;t drive long distances. After extensive research online for the best curling irons that can give me the look I wanted, I came across Miraqueen. I must say that all of the positive reviews on this product is what really sold me. I felt it was time to get a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; curling iron anyway. So far, I have had this iron for a couple weeks and I love it. This iron gives me the beautiful curly look that I wanted and they actually last all through the night when I am at my gatherings. I get so many compliments. I would definitely recommend this iron. It is very easy to use and safe.&lt;br /&gt; Five stars all the way!</li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed with this curler! Looking at all the different reviews online I thought it would work great but I really just wasted 100 bucks. My hair is pretty long and thick so maybe that&#x27;s the issue. On the hottest and longest time I got good curls but they didn&#x27;t last long at all. With a regular iron my curls last forever. If you can use a regular curling iron I would definitely not recommend wasting your money on this.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations based on the reviews here, but my wife ultimately didn&#x27;t find this to be as awesome as advertised.  Even with small amounts of hair, the machine would beep and reverse a bit.  We got it working properly about 1/2 of the time.  Maybe this takes more practice, but I&#x27;m a little concerned that after a day&#x27;s use the motor is making an unpleasant mechanical noise.</li>
            <li> I was shocked!  It works and lasts for days.  I love it so much I immediately took it to work and did my friends&#x27; hair! They all want one now!</li>
            <li> Great curls but unfortunately&lt;br /&gt;it stopped working after one use so had to return.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome curling iron, provides great curls in excellent price. It is really very easy to use. Does exactly the same work you want to do with this. Heats up real quick so you don’t have to wait for long. It makes great curls that last long. I would  highly recommend this product! It brings fantastic results.</li>
            <li> My friend loves this curling iron. I got one for myself and one for her birthday and her hair has been curly ever since. I think it&#x27;s her new favorite tool for her hair and I don&#x27;t blame her. Quick and easy curls. You don&#x27;t have to worry about burning yourself.And the styles come out amazingly! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Purchased this item for a friend on her birthday and she absolutely loved it.  She had been in search for a product of this quality since her last one (of a competitor brand) broke.  She will now exclusively deal with this brand.</li>
            <li> My husband ordered this for me and I really like it.  My standard curling iron was becoming a real problem due to the length of my hair. This works like a dream and having a selection of temps, steam and different times gives a nice variety of curl. It also tells you when the time is up. I dry my hair upside down to give fullness to the crown and then use the Miraqueen to curl the length. Although it works better using smaller section of hair I am usually down within 10 minutes or so. I remove each curl carefully and let cool. Once all the hair is curled I mist lightly with hair spray and let dry. After that the choices are endless, I use a wide tooth comb to loosen the curls into softer curls, fluff a bit, spray and go.  The only reason I did not give 5 stars is due to design. It can only be used with a certain side towards the head  and makes for a bit of awkward holding of the machine.</li>
            <li> WOW great curls and no tangles</li>
            <li> Love it.... Instruction are not great</li>
            <li> This curling machine is awesome. Have fine blonde hair, that would never hold a curl longer than 2 hours. These curls last all day!!</li>
            <li> This is the best curling I have come across in a very long time. The LCD screen is so easy to read and this curling iron has three heat levels and the timer insures you get the right curl every time. But my favorite feature is the auto turn off, it’s easy to forget to turn it off between being rushed, or a teen’s forgetfulness. This curling iron also features ceramic technology, which protects your hair from damage, another thing I like.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product. I normally have naturally curly hair and when I used this curling iron, I did not even have to blow dry my hair. I let my hair dry naturally and than I used it to straighten my hair. After a week, my hair is still straight and curly. thank you. I love this curing iron.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all right out of the box quick refund tho</li>
            <li> Always looking for a great curling product. My favorite rollers died and are no longer sold :( Tried this on the advise of my cousin in cosmetology. Works fantastic. My straight hair is about down to my tush and it is incredibly difficult to get a curl and keep it. Honestly, I don&#x27;t get all the fancy ion words or understand them, but it takes my hair in, steams it and unrolls into these luxurious bouncy curls that are great for date night outs. I love that it is not just a hot dry plate. Having long hair it is hard to maintain the health and shiny look - this product helps keep it that way. Can adjust heat setting depending on the curl level you are looking for or your hair type. I prefer a lower setting.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife and she absolutely loves it.  Here is her feedback:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The TIMER FUNCTION works perfectly! When the alarm sounds based on how you set it, and my hair is always done perfectly and never burns or cinges my hair (unlike other products I have had in the past)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also had a problem in the past with irons that heated some parts of my hair too much and others not enough. This would make it take longer to do my hair than it should have. With the Miraqueen, the heat distribution is pretty even so I have noticed that it takes a lot less time to get ready every day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the way the Miraqueen works. The designers obviously factored in EASE OF USE when designing this and it has paid off! The cord never gets tangled (which makes me never get tangled with it!) and the way it curls the hair makes it such that I don&#x27;t have to wrap my hair around the iron (helpful because I burn myself wayyy too much)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All told, the Miraqueen works better, quicker and more efficiently than any other curling iron I have ever had. And the price is so comparable that I will never use another kind of curling iron again!</li>
            <li> Last month, I was looking to give my sister a good lasting gift for her birthday and knew any hair care products would be much appreciated. After I did some research and found out she was in need of a new curling iron, I went for the search and landed here to find the &amp;#34;Miraqueen Professional curling wand&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good reviews was a helping start and so I went ahead and took the chance. Fortunately after 3 weeks of use, she exclaimed &amp;#34;it was the best gift given to her, so for the year&amp;#34;, because its so simple yet intuitively hi-tech with its self-guided LED indicators, to get the job done well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad I made the choice, it was a long-shot.</li>
            <li> I was always a fan of the curl wand but when i got the Miraqueen curling iron i was AMAZED! Not only did it give me perfect and consistent curls i finish my hair in less than half the time as your traditional curling irons. The fact that my hair would curl and steam at the same time leaving the finish product soft was mind blowing. I really love all the different features and settings it has to offer.Ladies if you want to spend less time curling your hairs this is going to be your best friend.</li>
            <li> One of the best curling irons I&#x27;ve used!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The greatest thing about this iron is how it makes your hair smooth and shiny, even if you&#x27;re using it after a long day, it smooths it out and makes it so silky soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other great features about this iron are the auto shut off - nice to not have to worry about leaving this on at home since it takes care of that for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also beeps when it&#x27;s ready to use, and at the right temp - you can also set the desired time for use, and it will beep when done prompting you to release the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The control buttons are also placed nicely, and the Light up screen is easy to read - no confusing configurations or displays - just a nice simple and easy to use iron!! Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> This item doesn&#x27;t have steam? Not what I was expecting!</li>
            <li> It works well when it&#x27;s not eating your hair.</li>
            <li> It is unfair for me to judge, bc daughter decided to return it.  I heard wonderful things about it.  They are returning it , bc they decided not to applet heat to the hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased the curling iron for my daughter, I purchased one a few months ago and loved it so much and was loving the compliments on how my hair looked. That when my daughter said mom what are you doing differently with your hair and I told her I started using the Miraqueen, she begged me to get one for her.  We both now have one and we love this amazing product.</li>
            <li> Score one for Hubby! My wife loves it and uses it everyday. I lost count of how many times she thanked me.</li>
            <li> Works really great! My hair never holds a curl,  but the steam setting makes mine last for a good 16 hours with a light spray rather than caking it on. I have had 2 instances where my hair became entangled and it took some work to get out, but not to the point of damaging my hair. Just wish I could out larger sections of hair in to go quicker.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually have time to style my hair, but recently I had a couple of big events and I thought I needed some pro equipment to make sure my hair looks stylish. This looks like the perfect tool. You can easily create the look with this curling wand. It&#x27;s easy to use and your hairdo is ready in less than 20 minutes - no need to go to the salon.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed. I&#x27;ve been looking around for a new curling iron for a while now and am very happy with this purchase. Its very easy to use and I love all the different options and settings. My curls last longer than they ever have before! I recommend to all.</li>
            <li> A friend gave me this curling iron because she knows how frustrated I have been trying to get curly hair. I am so happy with this product!! No curling iron has ever worked on my hair—the curls are always gone within a couple hours no matter how much hairspray I add.</li>
            <li> I love the Miraqueen steam wand. My hair long, thick and straight, it will not curl without kilograms of product in it. I have had other products &#x27;promise&#x27; to curl my hair for all day results, only to have my hair fall back flat in a couple hours.  The Miraqueen kept my hair curled for over six hours; a new record for this hair! I know less than nothing about beauty and things like hair styles are beyond me. I had to watch youtube videos to figure out how to use this, but once I did it was very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iron heats up in about 2 minutes which is good for my grab and go lifestyle. The timer makes the curls fool proof, and keeps me from burning my hair, which is what usually happens. The steam helps the curl stay and the barrel spins two ways, which is good for those fancier designs (I personally am too lazy for those!). Over all the wand is well worth the cost, it seems like it is very well made. None of the plastic feels flimsy and the hinge is substantial.</li>
            <li> Had many issues with this product.</li>
            <li> Curls thick hair beautifully!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this curling iron!!!!</li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t buy curling wands, because I&#x27;ve had so many bad experiences in the past. I bought another one on Amazon that nearly burned my hair. This one, though, was definitely one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made in a while. It works well, does the job quickly, and doesn&#x27;t burn my hair. I have naturally straight hair, so this is perfect for getting some nice curls in before I head out to meet with friends or for a party.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair. However, I get bored with my hair as it is quite often. So after browsing through curling irons, I came across this one. The features and reviews made this too good to pass up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The learning curve wasn&#x27;t steep at all. You basically put your hair into it and control the temp (based on how tight you want the curls). The timer feature is nifty so I don&#x27;t damage my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great curling iron that&#x27;s gotten me compliments!</li>
            <li> Christmas was coming up so i brought my girlfriend oneof these, turns out she foundi t and loves it and says its amazing. thanks! 5/5</li>
            <li> Super cute design that does wonders! I took this with me to my trip right after I got it in the mail. I didn&#x27;t have time to look up videos on how to use it, but I was surprised on how easy it was to use. Curls came out perfect. I have super thick hair too, and this iron handled my course, thick hair just fine! Curls lasted all day. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I Love this curling iron. Really a great product.</li>
            <li> I bought my wife the Miraqueen steam curing wand for her birthday a few months back and she absolutely loves it. Since she’s a teacher she has to wake up very early just to get ready for school; now that has this curling wand, she has cut that time in half. I’m not known as being someone to do well picking out beauty supplies for her, but I have to pat myself on the back for this one. She is a lot happier in the mornings because she can get her hair done quickly, and it looks great. This is especially great because we have 3 kids, and with 2 full-time working parents, it cuts down on the most important commodity that we have: time. This is truly a great product, and it proves rule #1 - Happy Wife…Happy Life!</li>
            <li> So who else has noticed that NONE of the reviews are from verified purchses? They are all also within 1 week of each other. 50 reviews in 1 week? Yea right.</li>
            <li> I used it one time and it stopped working halfway through curling my hair!  It just shut off by itself over and over.  Disappointing because if it worked, I think I would have liked it.</li>
            <li> It is highly suspicious that ALL  these 5 star reviews are from unverified buyers who have all bought several of the same products, and every single one of their  reviews is &amp;#34;marvelous, wonderful, and perfect&amp;#34;. I am purchasing this item and will leave an actual real review that is not paid for or coerced .This is where the review section on Amazon leaves a lot to be desired. I find it very sketchy that all these people bought 4 or 5 of the same items and all gave them amazing reviews.</li>
            <li> This a great curling iron!  I have straight and stubborn hair.  Nothing will hold by curls.  After I curl it, an hour later it will fall flat again. I like using this curling iron because it helps my curls to stay all day.  It uses steam to help set the curls and the ceramic plates really minimize damage to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it is easy to use. No more burning myself with the traditional curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough about this product.  It is a must have for those who love to wear curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it and you will fall in love with it like I did.</li>
            <li> This is an impressive bit of technology for curling your hair. I bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas and she loves it. I can&#x27;t help but be impressed with the results she has gotten with this. The technology geek in me likes the functions and specs this curling iron has. The LCD digital display makes it easy to set the iron to 1 of 3 desired heat settings, timer settings, curling direction, and steam switch. The steam technology with high heat really seems to set the hair well.  The outside of the curling iron remains cool so there is no danger of getting burned. Finally the most impressive thing is how it automatically winds up the air, then heats it and notifies you when it is done. Out pops her hair with nice bouncy curls. Looks fun to operate. Almost makes we jealous I can&#x27;t try it.</li>
            <li> Received this as a gift from my husband. It does wonders for my thick, hard to manage hair. My curls indeed come out full and bouncy. I highly recommend the Miraqueen Professional Steam Curling Wand!</li>
            <li> This curling iron looks so pretty! I love that the heating setting goes all the way up to 450 degrees because, at times, I have the frizziest hair and low level heating settings won&#x27;t do much for my hair. This curling iron also features ceramic plates, which is always a plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally think this curing iron is definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> SUPERB!!! Absolutely love this product! So easy to use. I like that it has different heat levels and timer settings. It’s ceramic so it slides through my hair with ease without pulling or tugging, protecting it from damage. Also, sometimes I can be scatter-brained so I love the automatic shut off feature (GOD FORBID) I do ever happen to forget to turn it off so I don’t burn the counter or in that case (the HOUSE) down, lol. It heats up so quickly and I don’t have to wait forever because I want to be able to use it when I’M READY to use it. I love the long lasting waves this product gives me, it leaves my hair looking gorgeous all day long. I love that it moisturizes my hair as well. I’m also very happy to hear that it has a one year warranty just in case (knock on wood) anything EVER does go wrong with it. My daughter uses this product every day and loves it too! The Miraqueen Professional Steam Curling Wand is definitely by far, MY FAVORITE curling iron thus far. Thank you Miraqueen! Happy Holidays to Everyone! :)))</li>
            <li> Best gift I got for Christmas!  I had been really wanting a steam curling iron for some time and my husband surprised me with one for Christmas. I have only been using it a few days and my hair&#x27;s volume and bounce are like night and day! It even adds some shine to my hair! My hair is usually flat and doesn&#x27;t hold a curl, but this product helps my curls to stay in much longer and my ends don&#x27;t feel dry/frizzy after use. Highly recommend for yourself or a gift!</li>
            <li> SUPER FAST SHIPPING!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Everything is GOOD however I am not sure but it seems like the curl does not longer lasting because of steam.... I know some people might say higher the temperature but I want to minimize the damage my hair.....</li>
            <li> The other reviews must be fake.  This thing is awful.  I set it on the highest setting (450) for the longest time (12 seconds) and it BARELY curled.  And after a few seconds of playing around with it my hair got stuck in this thing and I couldn&#x27;t get it out, which kind of had me freaking out.  So disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews for products but this curling iron is so amazing it deserves my time. I have coarse thick straight hair that never curls with my standard curling irons. I&#x27;ve always wished for curly and even got a perm years ago, but when perms grow out they look horrible and vowed never to do it again. I was a little afraid to try the Miraqueen at first, but I went ahead and tried it and the curls I got were beautiful, my hair didn&#x27;t feel damaged, and they stayed in all night without hairspray! I never got my hair caught in it, which I&#x27;ve read happens with some of the other curling irons like this that are made by other brands. I highly recommend this product, especially those with stick straight hair like I have who have always longed for curls.</li>
            <li> Great , great product. Love it . It really works</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long hair that is both very thick, yet fine. Generally in the past after curling my hair, the curls would tend to lose shape within a couple of hours, no matter what products I tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter The Miraqueen...this curling iron doesn&#x27;t damage hair like other curling products tend to, as the steam mist moisturizes as it curls, and the curls last all day, every single time! I couldn&#x27;t believe what a difference using this iron made versus using standard curling irons or wands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Miraqueen is easy to use and provides many different options for curl styles. My daughters love it as well...it&#x27;s durable, safe and a high-quality product that actually lives up to the hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend for anyone interested in glowing, wavy hair that turns heads.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday. Sometimes more than once. Works great. I would highly recommend this product. Have purchased in the past and purchased again with no hesitation. Good quality product</li>
            <li> Naturally, I was extremely hesitant to pay $130 for a curling iron. I did see more consistently good reviews for the Sultra irons than its wand competitors (CHI, T3, cheaper brands, etc.). I wanted a curling iron that didn&#x27;t have the clip in it and that&#x27;s exactly what I got and MORE. First off, this curling iron is FAST to heat up. In about 30 seconds it&#x27;s already heated and good to go. Second, it comes with a mitt to wear on your hand that is twisting your hair around the wand. I cannot stress this enough-- SAFETY people!! You absolutely must wear the mitt because this thing gets HOT!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit I was a little terrified to use this, but after I read a billion reviews I thought I&#x27;d take a chance.  I have thick THICK curly hair that goes past my shoulders and would normally take 1.5 hrs to curl with a standard iron. It took me 35 minutes to curl my hair with this magical tool!! BUT not after it got caught a few times and I just about had a heart attack (I did lose a little chunk of hair, but no more then i would have pulled out styling otherwise).  I suggest if you have thick or curly hair that you straighten it as much as you can first, and only do 1/2 in sections at a time. If you are timid at all, or not experienced with styling your hair this is NOT for you. BUT!  IT WORKS!!!</li>
            <li> This product makes me undeniably happy! I couldn&#x27;t find the right hair curler for my dull and straight hair. However, the Miraqueen curling iron ended up being the perfect hair tool for me! I was worried at first about purchasing this product because, I have tried everything else! hair crimps, other curling irons but I just couldn&#x27;t find the right technique for my hair! However, this product was definitely the right choice for my look and I am more than happy that I purchased it. I highly recommend the Miraqueen curling iron! You will not be disappointed, I can guarantee you that!</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron as a gift for my teenage daughter for Christmas. It was her first curling iron and I&#x27;ve never seen her more excited to try a present. She curled her hair on her own with no problem, and the curls lasted the entire day! She and I were so pleased with Miraqueen that we bought another for my wife. I recommend to anyone, young or old, looking for a full and long lasting curl.</li>
            <li> I love this! Best decision i&#x27;ve made ordering it. I was skeptical at first but I use it on a daily basis now. It&#x27;s easy, fast and effective.</li>
            <li> Such a cool curling iron! so fun to use.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!! Loved it!! Definitely works for fine, thin, straight hair.. It&#x27;s really easy to work with. It takes maximum 30 mins to curl your medium size hair. I feel my hair very soft and fluffy after doing my curls. :)</li>
            <li> Bought this to upgrade my current curling iron that lasted a good 2 years before it finally gave in.  This one has a lcd screen that displays the current functions so it&#x27;s a nice visual to have.  The button are right next to the screen for easy access, and gets hot enough for lasting curls.  It has a auto shutoff feature that every iron should have and the ceramic plates with steam gets me ready to go in the morning.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron! It is so easy to use. I use to use a curling wand but this is so much easier and gives way better curls that last! Not to mention the color is just so cute! Super device!</li>
            <li> My hair is thin, fine, and color treated, so according to the product description it should curl with the lowest heat setting, but it barely curled even with the highest heat and longest timer setting.  The curl that I did get was nice near my scalp then slowly loosened and practically straight at the ends. The curl didn&#x27;t hold for even 5 minutes, let alone all day.  It is not a matter of using it correctly, or practice and getting the hang of it.  I really tried to make this product work for me and it just doesn&#x27;t.  This product is a total waste of time and money.  And as another previous reviewer stated, many of the very glowing reviews here are fake.</li>
            <li> This steamy curling iron makes super awesome curls. I got this as an early gift for Valentines Day cause I&#x27;m always giving my hair curls in interesting ways, but I keep complaining to my boyfriend on how difficult it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re both happy now! Less complaining, more curls, everybody wins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it c:</li>
            <li> Works like a charm.... super easy to use. I now use it everytime I want to add extra volume and body to my hair!</li>
            <li> Awesome product, does the trick!</li>
            <li> The Miraqueen is a dream come true! No more burns on your face, forehead or fingers! Safe to use for all types of hair. The beep allows you to trust it to curl and not burn. The Miraqueen professional curling iron is easy to use and gives beautiful results! Be warned it reels your hair in and if you aren’t expecting that it will surprise you. If you add to much hair it will tell you and unreel your hair without tangling it. It has three heat levels and four timer settings so you can customize your look to the style you want and comes with an auto- off feature so you don’t have to panic if you leave it on. I love this product and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I loved this product. The curls lasted all day. I love all the settings. It doesn&#x27;t damage hair. It has an led screen that displays the temperature. Its definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> What a great product! It heats up fast and hot.  The iron makes awesome bouncy, shiny, healthy looking curls while the steam mist keeps your hair moisturized and prevents frizzing. I love the design of this iron. The ceramic chamber prevents your hair from tangling and helps to evenly heat the curls too – so they last longer. The iron is easy to use and the LED screen is easy to read. I also like the safety feature of the auto shut off.  This is a very quality and durable product and a great value for the money.</li>
            <li> My hair is so thick and long it takes a long time to curl it all. but it works great on all the kids.</li>
            <li> I know people are very skeptical about this product but I&#x27;ve had it now for a couple of months and it is in fact very easy to use. I have very straight hair with a straight perm and it still works, albeit I need to use a texturizer pre-hand some hairspray to set it. However, it is the easiest hair curling contraption that I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve tried steam rollers, hot rollers and curling iron and although they do work for about the first hour, but curls always come out and it&#x27;s soooo difficult to do by myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- easy to use&lt;br /&gt;- relatively inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t seem to damage my hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- takes about 15 -20 minutes to do my hair</li>
            <li> I love this curler. Really easy and simple to use without the fear of burning yourself. the curls last for a long time. I would definitely recommend this product. Very awesome curler! It is so easy to use that if I can do it, anybody can do it. After you get the hang of it, it is much faster then curling your hair with an iron. Works as well as the more expensive similar ones. I have really thick hair and the curling iron does wonders. My curls are perfect and I feel confident about my hair! I was even able to get some of my friends to purchase the curling iron as well. This curling iron is super easy to use. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> I have such thick hair and have always found curls very difficult to stay put. I was in a wedding party and the hair lady had this amazing curling iron.  Well after it worked on my hair I went out and bought one. I am very happy and now  have had many Saturday nights with big bold curls.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is a lot better for me than traditional curling irons. I&#x27;m always afraid I&#x27;m going to burn myself so I don&#x27;t usually curl my hair, but now with this one that isn&#x27;t a problem. Also, I share it with my sister who has very thick hair. My hair is very, very fine so the different heat settings come in very handy for the two of us. The auto shut off is great if you&#x27;re in a hurry you don&#x27;t have to worry about whether or not you forgot to turn it off. But my favorite thing is the timer settings. I can make sure all my curls are even. Usually by the last few curls I&#x27;m getting impatient and if there&#x27;s no timer I don&#x27;t hold them in as long. This eliminates that problem as well. The only problem now is that I have to share it!</li>
            <li> I have long straight - VERY FINE - hair. It takes a lot to get my hair to hold a curl. Normally I have to put a lot of product in my hair to get curl to set. With this curling iron, the curls come out really nice - with no product at all! They are big bouncy springy curls and I just love the way it make my hair look. The design makes it quick and easy to get a curly look so I don&#x27;t have to spend a lot of extra time when I want to do something different. Very happy with this! Works just great for me!</li>
            <li> The Miraqueen Professional Steam Curling Wand, Hair Culer with Ceramic Curling Chamber is the perfect, easy to use addition to your beauty regiem. Using steam and ceramic technology that prevents your hair from being damaged, even up to 450 degrees it gives great results each and every time. I especially love that it has 3 heat levels and 4 timer settings with an automatic shut off. The LED screen is easy to read and convient when you want to ensure that your hairstyle is uniform all around your head. With this curling wand you will find ways to use it every night out and each day in! This is my favorite for every occasion.</li>
            <li> Pros: excellent price!, great curls!&lt;br /&gt;Cons: nothing yet ;)&lt;br /&gt;Excellent Value and great wand. I am a pro hairdresser and use this constantly. It heats up really quickly and it gets very hot! I mean really hot so you can cut curl time in half. You must or you will burn the hair. So, adjust your curve immediately. Even as someone who is used to using a wand without a glove, I have burned myself with this baby. But, it gives great, lasting curls and I bought another one for my salon!&lt;br /&gt;It is a great value!</li>
            <li> I have interminably straight hair, so an excellent curling orn is must-have in my beauty arsenal. I thought I had a favorite, but after borrowing this model from my sister on a recent vacation, I realized I had been settling! I&#x27;m in love! And my morning ritual has leapt out of the stone age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model makes the entire process so easy (no to mention safe...I&#x27;m admittedly clumsy and have hurt myself in the past. This baby seems designed with people like me in mind). The steaming feature also keeps you from that accidental damage we&#x27;ve all done to our hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LED screen not only gives you a multitude of options, but they also let you give special attention to layering details on every part of your hair. Big curl here, small wave there. My hair has truly never looked better. And it does most of the work for you! Easy-peezy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking back at my old iron, I weep for all the time I lost when I could have been using this. Excellent results and easy to use.  Look no further, this is the one you want!</li>
            <li> Gave this iron to my wife as a gift for her birthday and I have never seen her so happy! She thanks me for this pretty much every time we plan to go out. Perfect for a birthday gift!</li>
            <li> This is a great curler! I bought it for a friend for Christmas and she absolutely loves it! I got this one for her because nothing else seems to work for her, traditional hair curlers, or wands. and I was hoping this would work. She also loves to forget things and shes always leaving without turning off her styling products. This one has a timer and turns off automatically. Overall great product! Would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I love this thing.  I lost mine on a trip and immediately bought another.  The LCD display is easy to use, in fact the whole unit is easy to use in general.  The steam tech is a blast to use and so effective.  And if your like me and burn yourself all the time by accident the outside of this curler stays cool to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want nice bouncy curls get it.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> What more can you ask for in a curling iron? My hair is so straight that even with the best hair products on the market, within thirty minutes it is as flat as a washboard. Only a curling iron of this caliber can work against such a force of nature to produce results time and time again. I was so tired of looking at my straight hair style that I knew it was time to invest instead of waste another $12-$40 on a curling iron that wouldn&#x27;t give me what I wanted. Besides allowing me to have beautiful curls that last, the ceramic materials don&#x27;t damage my hair and the timer keeps me from worrying that I will burn the house down. 5 Stars!</li>
            <li> My sister loves this and I just got it for her birthday and she has a new project everyday, and she is smiling again, that was worth more than the small fee of this curling iron.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Easy to use Curls!  So far so good.</li>
            <li> This thing works like the magic. The best part is that my curls last whole day. I have straight thick hair and usually by the end of the day, you can&#x27;t tell I curled anything but with this curling iron, it looks almost as strong as it did in the morning. However, it&#x27;s not easy for a beginner. The iron is very sensitive. It only accepts a small amount of hair each time. You cannot take a huge or even a large chunk of hair. So it&#x27;s not a time saver. It will take at least 10 minutes to curl. . Ironically I still recommend miraqueen, just not for the inexperienced.</li>
            <li> Wow! An easy to use curling wand that leaves hair with a professional finish look.  The  Miraqueen Professional Steam Curling Wand is a curling wand with a ceramic chamber for a smooth curling experience.  If you&#x27;re anything like me you&#x27;ve probably owned several curling irons.  When you come across one that&#x27;s being raved about then it makes you want to know what all the excitement is about.  Well, the excitement is about not having your hair damaged from overheating because The Miraqueen Professional Steam Curling Wand have 3 heat levels, 4 timer settings and as an extra precaution it has an auto power off. It&#x27;s not hard to read the setting and to find out the temperature because of the easy to read LED screen.  The best feature to me is the steam because it moisturizes your hair as you get those curls and waves that you want.. A product that can do all this has my recommendation.</li>
            <li> It came to me defective.. bought a new one from sallys ( red one ),works good.</li>
            <li> My fine blonde hair would not curl?  I was afraid to leave it on too long.</li>
            <li> I never knew the role ions have in creating healthy looking hair, but the women in my family told me how important they are. Apparently negative ions can stop the growth of bacteria in hair and also allow tiny water molecules to penetrate the hair shaft and seal the cuticle, which gives a healthy appearance to the tresses. Even if you don’t understand the science like me, you’ll appreciate the natural looking appearance and long-lasting curls that the Miraqueen Professional Steam Curling Wand evokes. This curling wand uses ceramic plates to prevent damage to the hair, and it heats only in the chambers on the inside, so there’s no burning of your hand or any part of your skin. It’s versatile: it has three heat settings and will go up to 450 degrees. This intense heat, plus the ions and the steam the wand generates, means you can come up with some very creative hairstyles. The four timer settings and the automatic shutoff feature give you the peace of mind that you’re not going make a mistake and leave it on too long. This is a fast, flexible curling wand -- it takes seconds to create perfect, long-lasting curls.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the handy LCD screen displays the timer setting, temperature, and curl direction. In addition, there’s a 360 degree swivel cord so you can move about freely while you’re curling your hair. For professional grade hair curling, the Miraqueen Professional Steam Curling Wand is an excellent choice.</li>
            <li> I purchased 3 these for my salon and they work fabulously! They are easy to use and create beautiful curls in minutes, its very easy to use and the many functions insures that I have full control of the curler.The curler is also very light so its convenient to use when working with a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> Dear all, this is heaven for hair!! My mom bought this for me on one of her trips to the US and its really the best. It curls really fast but protects the hair, and this was an issue for me because I have a very fragile blond hair. I ordered three additional irons for my best friends for xmas, yay! :D</li>
            <li> DOES ALL I EXPETED AND EVEN MORE</li>
            <li> My wife was looking for a convenient method to curl her hair at home. When I was looking for a good hair curling iron, I came across this product. My wife was impressed from the first moment that I gifted it to her. It has the ability to curl even the most stubborn hair within a short period of time. The three different heat levels are icing on the cake. I am highly satisfied with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I had mentioned to my mom a few weeks before Christmas how I wanted a steamer for my hair. I really love this product! It has this amazing feature that allows you to set a timer and the heat, and after the timer runs out it shuts off. It&#x27;s helpful feature for if you&#x27;re like me and tend to forget to turn your styling tools off, lol.  I&#x27;ve used the iron about 5 time times already and my hair wasn&#x27;t dry like it usually is when I use my curling iron. Even though my mom bought this for me, she often steals if from me. I can definitely say this was one of the better Christmas gifts I&#x27;ve gotten.</li>
            <li> Works great! This works better than the Miraqueen Pro for me. It does get hot quick, so you have to act fast while using it. I HIGHLY recommend watching the YouTube instructional videos before using. Use with a light mousse or hot spray for best results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with the Miraqueen appliance! I purchased it for my 13 year old granddaughter and she has no problem using it at all and it makes her hair look fabulous!</li>
            <li> Find hair gets tangled and caught easily. Like the results of the curl but don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to!</li>
            <li> I wear my hair in many different styles, but so far all my friends say that my beach waves is their favorite hairstyle. The loose waves is also my favorite style! I easily create the look with this curling wand. The heat allows the curls to last for a few days. I don&#x27;t have to struggle to curl my hair when using this curling iron. I love how this wand allows me to achieve flawless curls in less than 20 minutes. I have to give a five star rating to a five star curling wand.</li>
            <li> Excellent curling iron! I have stubborn, very straight hair that has a hard time holding curl. With a normal curling iron, even with products like hairspray, my curls only hold for maybe an hour after I finish before my hair falls flat again. I was hesitant about trying this curling iron because I&#x27;ve already wasted so much money on irons that are &amp;#34;guaranteed&amp;#34; to work and literally fall flat, but I&#x27;m so glad I gave this one a chance! My curls hold for hours and hours, they&#x27;re still there even if I sleep on them and when I wake up I just have to run my fingers through my hair to get it settled and I can wear the curled look again!</li>
            <li> I just received this 5 minutes ago and the dropper is broken like someone stepped on it.  :( I DON&#x27;T even want this now.  How badly was this package treated for this to happen?  Returning it :(</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift from my sister, who also has a Miraqueen Steam Pro 2 curler and loves it. Once again, she picked a winner. This is my favorite new tool in the beauty routine. It has a digital screen and timer so you get the curls you want. It heats up quickly and ready to go. I have fine, straight hair, so I was a little skeptical, but it certainly does its job. Curling irons are a thing of the past. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> Didn t curl my hair at all!&lt;br /&gt;A mess!!</li>
            <li> I got my girlfriend this as a gift recently and she absolutely loves it, and so do I. Her hair has never looked better. The curls, as she says, stay for a long period of time, and much more. Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> I got this for Christmas and I gotta say that I&#x27;m completely blown away by the quality of this product, my husband mentioned that he got a great deal. I needed a curling iron badly and this never dries my hair like the other one I&#x27;ve used for years. I absolutely love all the settings and the simplicity of the product.&amp;#60; Below are the benefits that I enjoyed.&amp;#60; :) :) :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  450 degree F, the highest heat to give long-lasting curls and waves&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  ceramic technology, protects hair from damage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  2 heat levels and 3 timer settings, beef alarm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  LED screen- displays timer, temperature, and curl direction&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  110 Voltage, 50 Watt,12-month Warranty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much for making this professional curling iron in that I truly enjoy using it and love the manual settings.&amp;#60; My hair never dries in that you can set the heat levels.&amp;#60; :) God bless!</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my daughter. Her hair is almost waist length.  It makes the most beautiful curls! My hair is less than shoulder length and it makes the cutest curls for my hair as well!  Long or short hair turns out beautifully! I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase!!</li>
            <li> Sent it back. didnt work so good for me.  I probably didnt use it right.</li>
            <li> i got one of these for my girl friend a couple weeks ago and she loves it! I was trying to find one that was a reasonable price but yet a quality item and this one is both! Its something shes never seen before but she loves the design and functionality of the item. She has very thin, hard to manage hair. And the hardest part was finding a curler that wouldn&#x27;t burn he hair. This one was great! Worked with her thin hair and didn&#x27;t harm it at all. I would highly recommend this to everyone. Its a good price and a great quality item. It cuts her time getting ready in half. Anyone with flat hair that normally doesn&#x27;t hold a curl should try this.</li>
            <li> Where do I even begin? This is unlike anything I&#x27;ve ever used. My hair has some wave to it but it&#x27;s so unruly. I try to curl it and the curl falls within hours. But not with the Miraqueen! It keeps my curls frizz free and shiny and they last all day long. I love that I can use the different heat setting to determine how formal I want the curls to look or to even create a messy texturized look for everyday wear. The best part is how simple it is to use. It doesn&#x27;t take me any longer than it would to straighten my hair. I will be buying these for my friends this year for Christmas. Everyone needs to know how great the Miraqueen curling iron is.</li>
            <li> Designed with the heating inside of the chambers, there is no burning of the hands involved. All the heating and curling action occurs within the head of the device, leaving the outsides cool to touch. Awesome, no more &amp;#34;hickey&amp;#34; burns! Ever feel like your arms are screaming at you after only doing half of your hair? MiraQueen is also light and easy to grasp, making those accidental drops less likely to happen and reduce fatigue.&lt;br /&gt;With automatic curling as the main star, curling could not be any faster! Your hair zips into the heating chambers, and after mere seconds, your perfect curls will come bouncing out. No more manual wrapping of the hair around old school curling irons! This is the new age and new technology!</li>
            <li> I have tried many curling irons but this one is far best. I love the simplicity of the design, it makes the iron easy to hold and use. The various settings are also amazing as sometimes I only want a slight curl while other times, usually when I go to parties, I want heavier curls. I recommend you try out this curling iron as well!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, Especially for the cost. I use it for all my curling. Does a professional job and quick! Love it!</li>
            <li> Curling Iron is graet.Awesome service.. I love it very much.I give A++++ and reasonable price.I like it and recommend you. Just try it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is a great curler! I&#x27;ve always used a wand or a curling iron on my long hair. My mom is a hair stylist and she was blown away. My curls lasted several days! I love how it has an alternating direction of curling. Best on clean hair with heat protection. I used it on 400 degrees for 10sec and my curls were perfect. For a non Shirley Temple look, straight iron ends and don&#x27;t start at crown of head. And a few seconds around face. You don&#x27;t want too tight of curls. I sprayed my hair with chi hairspray and brushed my hair with a brush. It&#x27;s the most amazing waves EVER. That last forEVER! I also used Moroccan oil to make hair soft.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. Really easy and simple to use without the fear of burning yourself. I would definitely recommend this product because the curls last a long time and in my opinion it is a very awesome curler! It is so easy to use that if I can do it, anybody can do it. After you get the hang of it, it is much faster then curling your hair with an iron. Works as well as the more expensive similar ones. I have really thick hair and the curling iron does wonders. My curls are perfect and I feel confident about my hair! I was even able to get some of my friends to purchase the curling iron as well. This curling iron is super easy to use. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these irons as gift and each person loves it! Quality design and easy to use.  Can&#x27;t go wrong buying this.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife as a present and she absolutely loves it.  She is not naturally curly but with this Miraqueen she is now!  It heats up and curls the perfect curl.  This also doesn&#x27;t dry out her hair like other curling irons used to.  She also loves the auto shut off feature because when in a rush you can easily forget to switch things off.  I found that a lot of curling irons didn&#x27;t offer that simple but valuable option.</li>
            <li> The Miraqueen Professional Steam Curling Wand combines beauty and science into a durable and useful styling tool. If you are looking for a boost in your everyday hair-styling routine, this versatile product can provide exciting styling options. Whether you want a low maintenance style or a more sophisticated look, the Miraqueen steam waver can deliver the style you&#x27;re after without damaging your hair.

            <li> LOVE IT! For the first time in my life I can style my hair! It&#x27;s a GREAT tool, it works smoothly, simply, and super safe! NO more doubts, give it a try!</li>
            <li> Amazing curler! I have poofy frizzy hair and this tames my hair into beautiful, soft professional looking curls. I always get tons of compliments whenever I use this. Great value, would definitely recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> This is amazing!  I did a lot of research, reading reviews of the Conair, Babyliss, etc. versions.  This one seemed to have the best reviews, and now I know why.  I have long, really thick hair, and it only takes me 20 minutes to do my whole head.  I have not had any hair get stuck in it, but have put too much in a couple of times.  The device just beeps to tell me there&#x27;s too much hair, and I remove some.  I get compliments everywhere I go, even the grocery store!  I am so glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that I have unruly hair.  I&#x27;ve been natural for nine years now and I love the freedom of changing my look without a lot of fuss.  Until I received the Miraqueen Curling Iron for Christmas, I would always have to pay a ton of money just to have my hair professionally straightened and styled.  Average, everyday curling and flat irons did nothing but damage my hair, leaving it frizzy and dry.  The Miraqueen not only straightens my hair with ease, it actually maintains the moisture needed in my hair without annoying frizz.  I am left with beautiful hair that is full of body and shine.  I love my Miraqueen!  It provides me with the versatility I need with styling without damage.  My favorite feature is that it automatically shuts off...great when I&#x27;m running late and forget to unplug it.  Ten stars for the best curling iron on the market...it&#x27;s really worth it&#x27;s weight in gold!</li>
            <li> Works OK, but certainly does not curl as well as promised no matter what settings are used.</li>
            <li> The curling iron was to heavy for me</li>
            <li> Gave it as a Christmas gift and it does not work, the box is gone.  Can I still return it??</li>
