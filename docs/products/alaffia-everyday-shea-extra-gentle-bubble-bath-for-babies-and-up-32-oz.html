            <li>Love this Bubble Bath, great smell, great bubbles</li>
            <li>The company that produces it also uses fair trade ingredients.  </li>
            <li>But it did smell good.</li>
            <li>bottle of affordable care and for your commitment to Fair Trade.</li>
            <li>You couldn&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice bath soap for babies.</li>
            <li>In any case, it&#x27;s a nice bath soap</li>
            <li>Its a nice bubble bath</li>
            <li>This Bubble Bath is gentle, smells great, feels good.  </li>
            <li>The smell is nice and the kids love it.</li>
            <li>Great scent, but very gentle on skin</li>
            <li>She always loved her baths anyhow, but she still thinks having a tub full of bubbles is a blast.  </li>
            <li>You have to use a lot, but it&#x27;s a huge bottle!</li>
            <li>I also appreciate that it is biodegradable and safe for the environment.</li>
            <li>Supposedly, the purchase and use supports the Alaffia Healthy Baby Program which provides nutrition and health care for babies in Togo.</li>
            <li>Love both the scents..</li>
            <li>I have both the lavender one and the eucalyptus one and love them both.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>I purchased this bubble bath because it was on sale, and although I love California Baby, I don&#x27;t love the price tag.  </li>
            <li>Not too overwhelming but just clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>There is also a lot more in this bottle than CB.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Again, I do wish they had a pump, or a squeeze top cap, but</li>
            <li>much better than the anemic bubbles you get from products</li>
            <li>the eucalyptus mint smell is OK...</li>
            <li>will buy it again though as it seemed the most affordable on the market.</li>
            <li>I love both of them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It also smells pretty good.  </li>
            <li>It smells so good, is gentle on their skin, and doesn&#x27;t leave a film in my bathtub.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line-&lt;br /&gt;Alaffia is significantly cheaper than California Baby and performed SO much better in the bubble department.  </li>
            <li>First off, it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>It seems very mild and supposedly is toxic free.</li>
            <li>It foams real easily and is much more foamy than his regular bath and has a nice light fragrance which smells somewhat like a mild cough drop.</li>
            <li>Really like this bubble bath because it smells soooo nice.</li>
            <li>It took a large quantity to really have good quality bubbles...</li>
            <li>My 4 year old was able to hop in the tub and wash her hair and body and the bubbles were still there!  </li>
            <li>love this gentle bubble bath product..  </li>
            <li>Item has been working really well for my kids they love the bubble and are looking foward to taking a bath every night</li>
            <li>Great bubble bath, creates just enough bubbles and leaves my baby&#x27;s skin feeling very soft.  </li>
            <li>If you want a gentle bubble bath for your child (or even yourself..seriously this stuff smells fantastic)</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell of Eucalyptus isn&#x27;t overpowering either, wish is GOOD because it won&#x27;t aggravate my little one.</li>
            <li>Smells good, average bubbles!</li>
            <li>The first I used was the lavender scent.  </li>
            <li>, I am so happy to say that this stuff actually makes a nice tub full of bubbles that last as long as regular bubble bath.  </li>
            <li>Secondly, it&#x27;s natural and is gentle for skin, obviously an important thing for children.</li>
            <li>The smell is not super strong, which I like, and both smells are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to pour in very much to have a lot of fun bubbles for a young kid to play with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The ingredients are pretty decent.  </li>
            <li>They were huge, and really did last forever.  </li>
            <li>so much the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary Peterson</li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t really smell the eucalyptus.</li>
            <li>It could be stronger but it was definitely very foamy</li>
            <li>not so much so</li>
            <li>very faint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this and will be back for more when I have finished this bottle.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really a fan of eucalyptus, but it&#x27;s not all that strong in this.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as pure as some companies, but there isn&#x27;t anything in it that completely scares me.  </li>
            <li>tried it out tonight in the tub for my 16 months old and the bubbles got so huge he was a little scared of them at first!  </li>
            <li>My wife and I bought this for our 2 year old son, who absolutely loves this for bath time.</li>
            <li>I am a new fan of Alaffia and what they stand for.  </li>
            <li>but I have VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Just wanted to point that out to those that have very sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li>The foam is long lasting and easy to generate.</li>
            <li>I am excited to try out their other products as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a deeper tub and the faucet sits pretty high and sends a straight stream of water down with out a lot of splashing.  </li>
            <li>The suds disappear quickly, but not as quickly as other natural brands.</li>
            <li>She has sensitive skin that is prone to eczema and dryness.  </li>
            <li>My 15 month old has no skin issues with this bubble bath whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>My 7 year old even commented while we were draining the tub</li>
            <li>This is a huge bottle and you only need to use a little so it last a long time.  </li>
            <li>First off, I have soft water, so my experience my differ from those who have hard water.  </li>

            <li> With California Baby, although it does bubble (not like it use to year ago) it doesn&#x27;t last long, and it doesn&#x27;t pile up.&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li> I get a TON of long lasting bubbles.  </li>
            <li> could definitely see this providing a comfy bath for anyone&#x27;s little one, especially if they have the sniffles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The ingredients list is so short it&#x27;s almost unreal, and the ingredients are MUCH less harmful then leading brands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I used to have hard water, I noticed that some natural products don&#x27;t seem to work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> A little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong when Eucalyptus Mint is a key ingredient.</li>
            <li> Also, weirdly, the bubbles are extra sparkly!</li>
            <li> someone who has been disappointed by other natural bubble baths</li>
            <li> this puts out some serious bubbles,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> (If you have been disappointed after using brands such as California Baby - you&#x27;ll know why I&#x27;m so happy!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product totally made my skin break out like a very bad wind burn.  </li>
            <li> I already buy all my body products from Everyday Shea, so I had a feeling I wouldn&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed this leaving a horrible ring in my tub - nor does it leave a film on everything</li>

            <li> Use it for my kids&#x27; bath. It smells so good, is gentle on their skin, and doesn&#x27;t leave a film in my bathtub. I also appreciate that it is biodegradable and safe for the environment.</li>
            <li> Lovely scent and great bubbles to play with!</li>
            <li> Our baby boy loves his nightly baths. All we need to say is \\&quot;bath\\&quot; and he comes running. He especially likes bubble baths and we&#x27;ve tried a variety of brands. A couple days ago my wife brought home a quart-sized bottle of Shea Butter Bubble Bath with eucalyptus scent. It foams real easily and is much more foamy than his regular bath and has a nice light fragrance which smells somewhat like a mild cough drop. The boy loves it and splashes and tosses the foam about. It seems very mild and supposedly is toxic free. The foam is long lasting and easy to generate. It&#x27;s a nice bath soap for babies. Supposedly, the purchase and use supports the Alaffia Healthy Baby Program which provides nutrition and health care for babies in Togo. In any case, it&#x27;s a nice bath soap and it it helps some babies out, so much the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary Peterson</li>
            <li> First off, I have soft water, so my experience my differ from those who have hard water.  When I used to have hard water, I noticed that some natural products don&#x27;t seem to work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From someone who has been disappointed by other natural bubble baths, I am so happy to say that this stuff actually makes a nice tub full of bubbles that last as long as regular bubble bath.  (If you have been disappointed after using brands such as California Baby - you&#x27;ll know why I&#x27;m so happy!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My toddler LOVES having this in her bath.  She always loved her baths anyhow, but she still thinks having a tub full of bubbles is a blast.  She has sensitive skin that is prone to eczema and dryness.  She hasn&#x27;t experienced any irritations to this at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also smells pretty good.  I&#x27;m not really a fan of eucalyptus, but it&#x27;s not all that strong in this.  I haven&#x27;t noticed this leaving a horrible ring in my tub - nor does it leave a film on everything it touches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also must add that the price of this is affordable when I compare it to other natural products.  The ingredients are pretty decent.  It&#x27;s not as pure as some companies, but there isn&#x27;t anything in it that completely scares me.  There aren&#x27;t any parabens, synthetic fragrances, dioxins, etc.  The company that produces it also uses fair trade ingredients.  You couldn&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
            <li> love this gentle bubble bath product..  Love both the scents..</li>

            <li> This stuff smells great and isn&#x27;t drying on my daughter&#x27;s skin. Also, weirdly, the bubbles are extra sparkly!</li>
            <li> Really like this bubble bath because it smells soooo nice. I have both the lavender one and the eucalyptus one and love them both.</li>
            <li> Makes very good bubbles. Pleasant smell. My son loves his bubble bath! I gave 4 stars because something in it doesn&#x27;t agree with my skin but I have VERY sensitive skin. Even hypoallergenic things bother me sometimes. My 15 month old has no skin issues with this bubble bath whatsoever.  Just wanted to point that out to those that have very sensitive skin like mine. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Item has been working really well for my kids they love the bubble and are looking foward to taking a bath every night</li>
            <li> Love this Bubble Bath, great smell, great bubbles</li>
            <li> The product totally made my skin break out like a very bad wind burn.  Must have been allergic to something in the product.  My room mate tried it in his bath once as well with the same result.  So i had to just throw it away.  But it did smell good.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Lots of bubbles. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best bubble bath I have bought. I use it for my grandsons as well as myself. The bubbles are still there after the bath!</li>
            <li> Great kids bubble bath. A little goes a very long way. I think this will last me years ha!</li>
            <li> I used to use California baby, but I switched to this. It lasts longer, smells great, and is cheaper. You have to use a lot, but it&#x27;s a huge bottle! The suds disappear quickly, but not as quickly as other natural brands.</li>
            <li> just a tiny splash will provide bubbles galore in your tub. The smell is nice and the kids love it. will def buy it again. Although the big bottle will probably last you a year.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually foams! Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Its a nice bubble bath but I couldn&#x27;t really smell the eucalyptus. It could be stronger but it was definitely very foamy</li>
            <li> This is an excellent bubble bath, the smell is wonderful and the kids love it, it bubbles plenty and it is organic and cruelty free... can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Great bubble bath, creates just enough bubbles and leaves my baby&#x27;s skin feeling very soft.  The smell is great as well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this bubble bath because it was on sale, and although I love California Baby, I don&#x27;t love the price tag.  So I&#x27;m always open for cheaper but not cheaper quality items.  This bubble bath (Eucalyptus Mint) smells great.  Not too overwhelming but just clean.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it out tonight in the tub for my 16 months old and the bubbles got so huge he was a little scared of them at first!  With California Baby, although it does bubble (not like it use to year ago) it doesn&#x27;t last long, and it doesn&#x27;t pile up.&lt;br /&gt;These bubbles are the kind we had with our toxic Mr.Bubble!  They were huge, and really did last forever.  My 4 year old was able to hop in the tub and wash her hair and body and the bubbles were still there!  My 7 year old even commented while we were draining the tub that he was impressed.&lt;br /&gt;I do wish it had a pumper a squeeze cap instead of a screw cap, but not a deal breaker.  There is also a lot more in this bottle than CB.&lt;br /&gt;While I have no scientific backing on how well this stuff actually cleans.  I am a new fan of Alaffia and what they stand for.  I am excited to try out their other products as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line-&lt;br /&gt;Alaffia is significantly cheaper than California Baby and performed SO much better in the bubble department.  Again, I do wish they had a pump, or a squeeze top cap, but not so much so that I wouldn&#x27;t re-purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please NEVER stop making this stuff!</li>
            <li> much better than the anemic bubbles you get from products&lt;br /&gt;sold by bath and body.  this puts out some serious bubbles,&lt;br /&gt;and it&#x27;s got nothing chemically in it.</li>
            <li> I already buy all my body products from Everyday Shea, so I had a feeling I wouldn&#x27;t be disappointed. The ingredients list is so short it&#x27;s almost unreal, and the ingredients are MUCH less harmful then leading brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of Eucalyptus isn&#x27;t overpowering either, wish is GOOD because it won&#x27;t aggravate my little one. It bubbles up very nicely as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could definitely see this providing a comfy bath for anyone&#x27;s little one, especially if they have the sniffles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend (this and all their products).</li>
            <li> It took a large quantity to really have good quality bubbles...the eucalyptus mint smell is OK...very faint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again though as it seemed the most affordable on the market.</li>
            <li> I have many allergies and it is difficult to find products that I can use .  This Bubble Bath is gentle, smells great, feels good.  I have no allergic reactions to it at all.  I definitely recommend this and will be back for more when I have finished this bottle.  Thank you for this 32 oz. bottle of affordable care and for your commitment to Fair Trade.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of this brand.  The first I used was the lavender scent.  I love both of them.  The smell is not super strong, which I like, and both smells are fantastic.  Also, at first I had a hard time getting it to bubble up a lot.  I have a deeper tub and the faucet sits pretty high and sends a straight stream of water down with out a lot of splashing.  I found if I hang my babies washcloth over the faucet where it makes the water splash a bit I get a TON of long lasting bubbles.  I have no idea why this works but it seems to solve that issue with me.  This is a huge bottle and you only need to use a little so it last a long time.  I have found the price on amazon isn&#x27;t much different than if I purchased it from my local Target so why not have it sent to my doorstep?!  If you want a gentle bubble bath for your child (or even yourself..seriously this stuff smells fantastic) this is a great choice.</li>
            <li> Great scent, but very gentle on skin</li>
            <li> Smells good, average bubbles!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried both the eucalyptus mint and the lemon lavender scents and they&#x27;re wonderful. I use this bubble bath in my child&#x27;s bath each night and it works great.</li>
