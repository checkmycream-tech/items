            <li>We have been buying more each month.</li>
            <li>Nice, clean scent for my touchless hand soap dispenser.</li>
            <li>First time using this hand soap and I like how nice it makes my hands smell after I use it.</li>

            <li>When the local store where I bought refills no longer carried them, I went to Amazon and found not only a good price but several choices of fragrance.  </li>
            <li>My wife and I have very sensitive skin and have had zero problems with this refill.</li>
            <li>Also, I think many of you are confusing the &amp;#34;kitchen&amp;#34; refills with the hand soap refills.</li>
            <li>It makes hands feel soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product and sad to see it fade out.</li>
            <li>This winter, no dry skin on my hands at all.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Good product--arrived In  good shape</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this soap. I have OCD so this lysol no touch is perfect for my house. I have one in the kitchen snd bathrooms. People don&#x27;t always was their hands as they should, so to keep me from touching a dirty bar or soap pump..I love it. Also, I think many of you are confusing the &amp;#34;kitchen&amp;#34; refills with the hand soap refills. They are two different machines and the refills are different. This soap featured is for the handsoap dispenser only!!!! Make sure to read before purchasing, so you stop writing negative comments because you failed to read!</li>
            <li> This is really about keeping clean. I have not used any other name for the Hand Soap. Lysol has really done a great job in the feel of this product. The price is one of the best around. And it has a good smell to it as well.</li>
            <li> I love the No Touch Hand Soap for the Kitchen. I have been told by Lysol, this has been discontinued. I did find these on Amazon along with a new dispenser, Wish the variety would have been a little less expensive. It only fits the No Touch Kitchen and not the regular hand style. It&#x27;s a good product and sad to see it fade out.</li>
            <li> I purchase the kitchen system at the store, then need refills and cannot find them. Go to Amazon find refills that say kitchen system receive them and then they do not fit. This is very frustrating. If feel companys are always taking advantage of their customers.</li>
            <li> they did not fit in holder, had put in old bottle.</li>
            <li> better yet the wife  Loves it</li>
            <li> This soap is specifically designed to work in the battery operated Lysol automatic soap dispenser.  It snaps in with a firm press.  No spills or leaks detected.  I have placed one of these dispensers in each of five bathrooms.  The soap quality is very good.  The smell is nice.  It makes hands feel soft.  I typically suffer from dry skin on fingers around my fingernails durin the dry weather of winter.  This winter, no dry skin on my hands at all.  I recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> This was the least expensive scent I could find on Amazon for the quantity purchased. My wife and I have very sensitive skin and have had zero problems with this refill.</li>
            <li> Soap does not lather up.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This was not as foamy soapy as a detergent soap ought to be. Nor did it last very long. But still, it does clean the dishes, so it is fulfilling its purpose.</li>
            <li> I could not find these anywhere locally!  They&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li> pricier than i would have liked, but gets the job done</li>
            <li> First time using this hand soap and I like how nice it makes my hands smell after I use it.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with it and it is a seasonal fragance... WHY WHYYYYYYY????????? It&#x27;s the Pepsi huihuichu all over again NOOOOOOO</li>
            <li> This soap refill smells great and is anti-bacterial.  It&#x27;s a great product and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love these soap dispensers for an easy no touch option for washing hands!  When the local store where I bought refills no longer carried them, I went to Amazon and found not only a good price but several choices of fragrance.  This one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> The Lysol that was sent did not match my dispenser, therefore my son had to take the top of and place it on the new Winterberry sparkle an that is what i will have to do each time it becomes empty..that was a big let down.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 dispensers when Lysol first introduced the product. I am sold on it, no touch, no germs,no contamination, clean hands and the fun is its battery operated.</li>
            <li> Like the concept of no touch hand soap delivery system.  Like the flavor and smell and, of course, it works.  Was a good value.</li>
            <li> Need to use alot of soap for cleaning,  and that for dishes or hands.&lt;br /&gt;Not like the other soap this winterberry soap suck. Will not be getting this kind again..&lt;br /&gt;The hands No Touch Unit works great.</li>
            <li> Much nicer smell than the aloe!! Works great, smells great, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Nice scent.  Good service</li>
