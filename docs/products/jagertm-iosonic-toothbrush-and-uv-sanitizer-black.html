            <li>and it is wonderful</li>
            <li>(Black)]]&lt;br /&gt;I happily use my Jager Toothbrush, it makes my mouth feel like a star!  </li>
            <li>I have never written a review on products before, but I just had to share with others how great a product and company this is!!  </li>
            <li>Will buy more for my family members!!!!!</li>
            <li>happy with the product, had it for 3 years.</li>
            <li>But for $36 I was happy with it while it lasted.</li>
            <li>I have had my Jager toothbrush for over a year and LOVE IT!!  </li>
            <li>he was so impressed with it himself - so I did and I love it.</li>
            <li>it was a good toothbrush set.</li>
            <li>I loved it at 1st</li>
            <li>For the coupon price I figured it is a good deal</li>
            <li>I love my Jager!</li>
            <li>I love knowing she is getting a thorough cleaning every day because of the 2-minute timer!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for you and your family, for sure!</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that it has a sanitizer!  </li>
            <li>They ALL LOVE them!  </li>
            <li>and I am loving this even more!</li>
            <li>it gives me a kind of teeth sensitivity.</li>
            <li>She loves the fact that she can have her own color band on her brush head.</li>
            <li>By far the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I did not used it more often b/c</li>
            <li>Otherwise, you are better off with a drugstore brand.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had this for more than a year</li>
            <li>I love the choices of colors and the sleek style.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t find that with many companies today.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a more well-known brand for years and got a Jager about a year ago and have to say, I like this one better.  </li>
            <li>I have been an electric toothbrush fan for many years.</li>
            <li>I think the tooth brush works great, but I can&#x27;t find replacment heads anywhere so to continue with the toothbrush I will have to order straight from the company.</li>
            <li>, it wouldn&#x27;t stay on for more than 10 seconds at a time.</li>
            <li>We love the way our teeth feel so clean after each use!</li>
            <li>Not only do we love the product, but the customer service at Bling Dental is amazing!!</li>
            <li>This so-called Dr. Raymond is getting rich by ripping off well-meaning consumers!</li>
            <li>However I am quite satisfied, but if you want easy replacement heads stick to the well known brand.</li>
            <li>These reputable sites should not sell this cheap junk.</li>
            <li>Oh Please is there really something good about this devise?</li>
            <li>I have had my brush for about 2 months now and love how clean my teeth feel.</li>
            <li>Save yourself the aggravation and money and skip this product for a more reputable and higher quality product.</li>
            <li>- both still work just fine.</li>
            <li>I bought this from Amazon through one of their daily deals and when it arrived I thought it looked good and would be a great new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>What a cheap piece of junk.</li>
            <li>It feels cheap, it is cheap.</li>
            <li>No grief there</li>
            <li>the brush head didn&#x27;t fit flush against the handle.</li>
            <li>nothing special, cheap materials.</li>
            <li>It leaves my teeth feeling so clean.  </li>
            <li>with that not so clean mouth feeling</li>
            <li>I bought this on a \\&quot;special deal\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the Jager toothbrush during a special deal promotion.</li>
            <li>I bought it on a deal special.</li>
            <li>She got one for my boys as well because it was such a good deal</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t bother contacting the company because I also read in the reviews that the replacement cost is about what I paid for the deal, so I would end up paying full price for one that might work.</li>
            <li>The fact that my teeth have a fresh, dentist-like every day makes this tooth brush worth every dime!</li>
            <li>The brush head design is great for reaching all areas of the mouth and it feels a lot less jarring in my mouth and in my hand than the \\&quot;other\\&quot; brush and my teeth feel fabulously clean when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li>Next time I will try a more reputable brand.</li>
            <li>had misgivings about the quality of this when I first got got it because the handle was really light and</li>
            <li>Biodegradable plastic works by disintegrating in sunlight, the same kind of plastic that they use in dog park clean up bags.  </li>
            <li>and I figured I got my money worth</li>
            <li>For a product as crappy as this, we should be able to give it negative stars - one star is just too good.  </li>
            <li>right?  </li>
            <li>I have had a sonic, but much prefer this and love the ease of ordering new brush heads on line.</li>
            <li>but I really love the UV light sanitization (the brush heads are held against a light bulb to burn off any little microbes).</li>
            <li>smile pretty :0)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using my Jäger toothbrush daily and am in love with it.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush is exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m confident that I am cleaning my teeth and getting the maximum oral hygiene possible when I use this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a lot of different electric toothbrushes and never have I seen any of them break and have as many problems as the Jager toothbrush does.  </li>
            <li>I would never pay as much as it sells for here or on their website!</li>
            <li>We LOVE them and the colors are terrific!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just going to go back to the Philips Soniccare toothbrush which is way better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely not sorry I switched over to the Jager.</li>
            <li>The most recent was the Oral B brush which has rotating heads.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice looking and goes in my bathroom nicely, doesn&#x27;t take up a ton of counter space like the \\&quot;other\\&quot; brush and base, AND the little blue light on it acts as the perfect nightlight!  </li>
            <li>I am actually positive, and I&#x27;m trying to prove it, that the heads are made with biodegradable plastic.  </li>
            <li>The heads for this thing break when they are still in excellent condition and overall a different toothbrush will cost you less.</li>
            <li>Whoever is making and selling these are absolute crooks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve forgot to bring it when traveling and have felt so lost without it and really couldn&#x27;t wait to get home to it</li>
            <li>I purchased in March and it worked very well cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>My whole family is now converted to the brand.</li>
            <li>, just looked really</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li>I was very exited to try it out after reading description.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth about 50 cents as far as I can tell.  </li>
            <li>You can pick up an Oral B or Sonicare for under $100 with a reasonable warranty.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it seems to brush okay.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d have that clean feeling that a regular toothbrush just can&#x27;t do for you.  </li>
            <li>As long as the plastic stays out of sunlight it will be fine</li>
            <li>Through a divorce I found it an opportunity to try something new and was very intriqued that the dentist suggested a sonic toothbrush as the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>I liked this product at first, but it kept getting harder and harder to get the toothbrush head off after each use for sanitizing.  </li>
            <li>Jager trying to promote your product as high quality.</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t gonna be that great and guess what, I was wrong.</li>
            <li>I bought all my products directly from Bling Dental directly on-line and they have really gone out of their way to serve me well!</li>
            <li>Now I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>The new one they replaced lasted 1 month.</li>
            <li>so that means that every time the light comes on it is causing the heads to start to break down.  </li>
            <li>I will be switching back to a Sonicare as I care about my dental health enough to buy a good toothbrush that will last long enough to pay for itself.</li>
            <li>, only then will you learn that they have a policy of charging customers to pay return shipping on their faulty products (if more than 30 days after purchase).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the limited product quality and equally lackluster</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>The size, feel, action and sanitary aspects of the brush have improved all my problem areas.  </li>
            <li>Now I have to say that customer service and returns were professional and handled well.  </li>
            <li>I found my old  phillips sonicare toothbrush and</li>
            <li>I have a Braun Oral B, and the brush heads fit flush with no cheap and ill-fitting rubber washer.</li>
            <li>the light bulb inside was dead upon arrival.</li>
            <li>and I stumbled upon Amazon&#x27;s Local voucher program and bought this very brand for under $100.</li>
            <li>I bought six toothbrushes direct from the Bling Dental Product website.</li>
            <li>Unless you want to be constantly buying expensive replacement heads for this toothbrush I would highly recommend spending a little more up front on a better sonic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>If you feel like the cost of this product is worth 6 months or less of use, then get it.</li>
            <li>I havent compared it to other sonic toothbrushes since this is my first one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another problem I had was that mold started growing inside the brush heads after a while! :O</li>
            <li>I use it daily and my 7 year old daughter uses it as well.</li>
            <li>After about 4-ten second intervals, it completely stopped.</li>
            <li>My husband finally wrenched the toothbrush head off, and now I am forced to only put it halfway on so that I can be sure of getting it off again.</li>
            <li>I kind of suspected it was cheesy when I read all the self-promotion by the dentist whose company sells them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;HOWEVER, the head never fit right on the toothbrush</li>
            <li>After four months the battery barely holds enough of a charge for one brushing.</li>

            <li> I bought six toothbrushes direct from the Bling Dental Product website.</li>
            <li> Unless you want to be constantly buying expensive replacement heads for this toothbrush I would highly recommend spending a little more up front on a better sonic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> If you feel like the cost of this product is worth 6 months or less of use, then get it.</li>
            <li> I havent compared it to other sonic toothbrushes since this is my first one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another problem I had was that mold started growing inside the brush heads after a while! :O</li>
            <li> I use it daily and my 7 year old daughter uses it as well.</li>
            <li> After about 4-ten second intervals, it completely stopped.</li>
            <li> My husband finally wrenched the toothbrush head off, and now I am forced to only put it halfway on so that I can be sure of getting it off again.</li>
            <li> I kind of suspected it was cheesy when I read all the self-promotion by the dentist whose company sells them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;HOWEVER, the head never fit right on the toothbrush</li>
            <li> After four months the battery barely holds enough of a charge for one brushing.</li>
            <li> and the battery does not last long enough to actually brush your teeth.</li>
            <li> Evidently I brush too hard in some spots and never reach some parts of others.  </li>
            <li> It is basically some cheap plastic with a weak vibrating battery attached!</li>
            <li> and I had been looking for an ionic toothbrush for a long time.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Jager iOsonic toothbrush only because it was pink.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right, the handle will not operate if the head is slightly broken.  </li>
            <li> They obviously didn&#x27;t use any battery charge controlling in their hardware like other manufacturers have.</li>
            <li> I have a black Jager and have bought the Diamond brush, the pink Jager, Pearl Jager and black ones for my adult kids!  </li>
            <li> Lasted less than 6 months and stopped fully charging, so in the middle of brushing, it would quit.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it three or four months, and other than the annoying high pitched whine, it seemed to work fine.</li>
            <li> O, and by the way, it does have a limited warranty - Just 3 months!</li>
            <li> I expected a minimum of a year, MINIMUM 1 year.</li>
            <li> I had the pink one</li>
            <li> 6 months later my toothbrush&#x27;s battery was completely dead.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes the company&#x27;s customer service two business days to respond to e-mails - whether it is to send out their &amp;#34;required trouble shooting procedures&amp;#34; or to reply back after they asked for clarification on a shipping address.</li>
            <li> So, you get to throw it out like a lot of other junk made in China.  </li>
            <li> That has never happened with any other electric toothbrush I have owned.</li>
            <li> It was still pretty expensive</li>
            <li> Within three months of gifting them to others, I have had to replace two of the six brushes (one wouldn&#x27;t charge and the other wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge).</li>
            <li> I looked in the paperwork and on their site and couldn&#x27;t find any reference to a warranty, but apparently other reviewers attempted to return it and found that it was 90 days.  </li>
            <li> my only problem has been that I had a hard time replacing the uv bulb due to it being out of stock</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t think you would see the black mold on a black brush, so be careful.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve never had this problem with any other electric toothbrush, and we&#x27;ve had lots in our family over the years!  </li>
            <li> We are an active family and I am getting these skateboards for the little guys and gals and their parents.  </li>
            <li> It will fail you well before it should and for it&#x27;s price, it should last multiple years.  </li>
            <li> NOT TRUE.  </li>
            <li> Well today, after dinner, I used it, and after rinsing, I noticed little black specs and pieces in the sink.</li>
            <li> We got this on deal day after I moved home just under a year ago because I had gotten separated from my husband and I was looking for anything to make my life easier and a little brighter</li>
            <li> what do you know, still had a bit of a charge to it after sitting in a drawer for a little over a year.  </li>
            <li> A little note to Phillips Sonicare:  </li>
            <li> Groupon also sells this product often, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this a few months and the bottom is cracked</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> - it is a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> and its money wasted</li>
            <li> Took me a few weeks to figure out how the system worked</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t eat anything black!</li>
            <li> Not cool!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your hard earned money on this &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34; toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> mine didn&#x27;t start having problems until a few months ago!</li>
            <li> Poor quality and not worth a penny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Oral B for about 20 years and my Sonicare for at least 10</li>
            <li> The battery life on the handle is terrible and the heads break easily making it worse, let me explain.  </li>
            <li> waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> Too bad I didn&#x27;t read that stuff before I spent the money.</li>
            <li> The heads are made of a thin plastic and when they start to break they cause the toothbrush to stop working.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t recommend this product, it is expensive, but is of poor quality.</li>
            <li> Asked them for another alternative, NOTHING, DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME WITH THIS PIECE OF JUNK!!!!</li>
            <li> Maybe silly,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mad.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m like WTF!</li>
            <li> I had looked it up online and saw all the bad reviews, including here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Well, I thought maybe it was just my bad luck</li>
            <li> I have never been so disappointed in a product I bought online.</li>
            <li> and I was so disappointed when I received the product.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor: don&#x27;t buy this crap.</li>
            <li> Highly disappointed!</li>
            <li> Jager is overpriced for the fact that the battery life is horrible.</li>
            <li> I have used plenty of rechargeable products and theirs has the worst battery life I have ever seen.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this thinking it was a good toothbrush set. This is such a piece of junk.  The look, the feel, the sound,  everything about it says cheap  plastic crap.  I have never been so disappointed in a product I bought online. Groupon also sells this product often, don&#x27;t waste your money. These reputable sites should not sell this cheap junk.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on November 20012. I used it about 1-2 times per week or not at all. In May stopped working (it just buzzing). I did not used it more often b/c it gives me a kind of teeth sensitivity. I called customer service and left a message. No answer. I don&#x27;t like to be ripped off. A product cannot be sold to last so short usage. Don&#x27;t buy it. If you bought it return it ASAP before 30 days return window expires.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a \\&quot;special deal\\&quot;.  I should have saved my money!  I&#x27;ve had this a few months and the bottom is cracked, the off/on button won&#x27;t work which means I can&#x27;t switch speeds after I bang it on the sink to get it started. Save your money!&lt;br /&gt;And the final straw was when I unplugged it and the cover came off leaving the wires exposed and still plugged in!!</li>
            <li> Wow. I&#x27;m mad. What a cheap piece of junk. I bought one for my husband and I and both broke within 6 weeks. It feels cheap, it is cheap. Whoever is making and selling these are absolute crooks. What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended I get the Jäger toothbrush bc he was so impressed with it himself - so I did and I love it. I&#x27;ve had several sonic care brushes before and I definitely prefer this one!</li>
            <li> happy with the product, had it for 3 years. my only problem has been that I had a hard time replacing the uv bulb due to it being out of stock</li>
            <li> We got this on deal day after I moved home just under a year ago because I had gotten separated from my husband and I was looking for anything to make my life easier and a little brighter and I had been looking for an ionic toothbrush for a long time. My mom has a Diamond version from this brand and it is wonderful so we took a chance.....NEVER AGAIN! She got one for my boys as well because it was such a good deal but they just started using theirs a couple months ago so it is working well...mine didn&#x27;t start having problems until a few months ago! Highly disappointed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Jäger toothbrush daily and am in love with it.  It leaves my teeth feeling so clean.  My last electronic toothbrush left me unsatisfied and with that not so clean mouth feeling so I gave this one a try.  Now I can&#x27;t live without it.  There have been a couple times I&#x27;ve forgot to bring it when traveling and have felt so lost without it and really couldn&#x27;t wait to get home to it so I&#x27;d have that clean feeling that a regular toothbrush just can&#x27;t do for you.  I am all about investing in quality products.  This works and it works well! smile pretty :0)</li>
            <li> Lasted less than 6 months and stopped fully charging, so in the middle of brushing, it would quit.  While it was under a one year warranty, they wanted me to return it at my expense for repair.  The postage was about 1/2 of what I paid for the darn thing, so I opted not to bother.  Asked them for another alternative, NOTHING, DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME WITH THIS PIECE OF JUNK!!!!</li>
            <li> I loved it at 1st but it no longer holds a charge ! I went back to Braun Sonic care unit - No grief there</li>
            <li> I purchased this product through a deal site. Shortly after purchase I read reviews that it would stop working after about four months. I thought my experience would be different. I purchased in March and it worked very well cleaning my teeth. But in September started shorting. By October it wouldn&#x27;t even turn on. I didn&#x27;t bother contacting the company because I also read in the reviews that the replacement cost is about what I paid for the deal, so I would end up paying full price for one that might work. If you feel like the cost of this product is worth 6 months or less of use, then get it. Otherwise, you are better off with a drugstore brand.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is exactly what I needed.  My dentist was concerned about my gums and about my back teeth.  Evidently I brush too hard in some spots and never reach some parts of others.  The size, feel, action and sanitary aspects of the brush have improved all my problem areas.  I no longer feel I have to do head stands to get all my teeth.  My gums are stronger and the receding parts have stopped.  I would recommend this brush without hesitation.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00AAJ4WAU JägerTM iOsonic Toothbrush &amp; UV Sanitizer (Black)]]&lt;br /&gt;I happily use my Jager Toothbrush, it makes my mouth feel like a star!  I&#x27;m confident that I am cleaning my teeth and getting the maximum oral hygiene possible when I use this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> We jokingly call this product our crack of toothbrushes. My whole family is now converted to the brand. We love the way our teeth feel so clean after each use! Can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> I bought this from Amazon through one of their daily deals and when it arrived I thought it looked good and would be a great new toothbrush.  It didn&#x27;t work.  I had to get a replacement sent to me.  Now I have to say that customer service and returns were professional and handled well.  The toothbrush itself is a different matter.  The battery life on the handle is terrible and the heads break easily making it worse, let me explain.  The heads are made of a thin plastic and when they start to break they cause the toothbrush to stop working.  That&#x27;s right, the handle will not operate if the head is slightly broken.  Now I have a theory that the heads are made to break so that you have to keep replacing them.  I am actually positive, and I&#x27;m trying to prove it, that the heads are made with biodegradable plastic.  Biodegradable plastic works by disintegrating in sunlight, the same kind of plastic that they use in dog park clean up bags.  As long as the plastic stays out of sunlight it will be fine but if you leave it in the sun for a day it falls apart.  Now I suppose you are wondering what the heck I&#x27;m talking about this for, right?  The UV lamp inside the charging device is the same as sunlight so that means that every time the light comes on it is causing the heads to start to break down.  I&#x27;ve had a lot of different electric toothbrushes and never have I seen any of them break and have as many problems as the Jager toothbrush does.  Unless you want to be constantly buying expensive replacement heads for this toothbrush I would highly recommend spending a little more up front on a better sonic toothbrush.  The heads for this thing break when they are still in excellent condition and overall a different toothbrush will cost you less.</li>
            <li> Jager is overpriced for the fact that the battery life is horrible. I have used plenty of rechargeable products and theirs has the worst battery life I have ever seen. I bought a set for my wife and I January 2013, it&#x27;s now September 2013 and the battery does not last long enough to actually brush your teeth. Mine will get through 2 of the 30 second cycles and then you can keep trying to turn it on for another ten seconds tops and get short bursts out of it. Hers gets through about 3 of the 30 second runs but sometimes doesnt charge up at all. They obviously didn&#x27;t use any battery charge controlling in their hardware like other manufacturers have. I will be switching back to a Sonicare as I care about my dental health enough to buy a good toothbrush that will last long enough to pay for itself. I expected a minimum of a year, MINIMUM 1 year. Instead I got 9 months and it aborted on me.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this for more than a year and it is failing to stay on for 30 seconds per quadrant.  There are no serviceable parts on this chinese made pos.  So, you get to throw it out like a lot of other junk made in China.  I found my old  phillips sonicare toothbrush and what do you know, still had a bit of a charge to it after sitting in a drawer for a little over a year.  Don&#x27;t waste your hard earned money on this &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34; toothbrush.  It will fail you well before it should and for it&#x27;s price, it should last multiple years.  Save yourself the aggravation and money and skip this product for a more reputable and higher quality product.</li>
            <li> I bought this about 1 year ago. I found it on a coupon site and got it for $36. I had looked it up online and saw all the bad reviews, including here on Amazon. For the coupon price I figured it is a good deal and I give it a shot. I have to say that I had no problem with the battery. I only had to charge it like 4 times in almost 1 year. I didn&#x27;t leave it on the charger and only put it on the charger when it needed to be charged.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, the head never fit right on the toothbrush and there was a big gap and the metal stick would show, not that it was a problem, just looked really ugly.&lt;br /&gt;Another problem I had was that mold started growing inside the brush heads after a while! :O ewwwwwww! That has never happened with any other electric toothbrush I have owned. Not cool! I had the pink one so I could see it, I don&#x27;t think you would see the black mold on a black brush, so be careful. At that point I had it for almost a year and I figured I got my money worth and I threw it in the trash! I would never pay as much as it sells for here or on their website! But for $36 I was happy with it while it lasted.</li>
            <li> I love my Jager! I use it daily and my 7 year old daughter uses it as well. She loves the fact that she can have her own color band on her brush head. I love knowing she is getting a thorough cleaning every day because of the 2-minute timer! My dentist recently told me, \\&quot;What ever you are doing, keep it up!\\&quot; I know that is because of my use of the Jager for over a year now. The fact that my teeth have a fresh, dentist-like every day makes this tooth brush worth every dime! I would recommend this product for you and your family, for sure!</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it wasn&#x27;t gonna be that great and guess what, I was wrong. By far the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve used. It truly made my teeth feel like I had just came from my dentists office. I highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I have had my brush for about 2 months now and love how clean my teeth feel. I have had Oral B&#x27;s for years and I am loving this even more!</li>
            <li> I have had my Jager toothbrush for over a year and LOVE IT!!  I bought one for my daughter also and I see a difference in the whiteness of her teeth and she says the same about mine!  I also love the fact that it has a sanitizer!  I have had a sonic, but much prefer this and love the ease of ordering new brush heads on line. I love the choices of colors and the sleek style.  I have a black Jager and have bought the Diamond brush, the pink Jager, Pearl Jager and black ones for my adult kids!  They ALL LOVE them!  We are Bling Dental fans!!  Not only do we love the product, but the customer service at Bling Dental is amazing!! You don&#x27;t find that with many companies today. I bought all my products directly from Bling Dental directly on-line and they have really gone out of their way to serve me well! I have never written a review on products before, but I just had to share with others how great a product and company this is!!  In addition, the company has a side business of skate boards.  We are an active family and I am getting these skateboards for the little guys and gals and their parents.  We LOVE them and the colors are terrific!!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Jager toothbrush during a special deal promotion. It was still pretty expensive and I was so disappointed when I received the product. It is basically some cheap plastic with a weak vibrating battery attached! Poor quality and not worth a penny. I&#x27;m just going to go back to the Philips Soniccare toothbrush which is way better. Shame on you Jager trying to promote your product as high quality.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone.  My husband and I have used Phillips Sonicare for years and have never had any problems whatsoever.  I purchased the Jager iOsonic toothbrush only because it was pink.  Maybe silly, but I assumed all electric toothbrush were made equal.  NOT TRUE.  I brush my teeth twice a day and the bristles do not hold up at all.  After three weeks use the brush needed to be replaced.  Were there any instructions in the pamphlet as to how to remove and replace the brush?  NO.  I had to contact the company and am waiting to hear back from them.  Do not purchase this product - it is a waste of money.  A little note to Phillips Sonicare:  how about keeping your model but adding different colors that way there isn&#x27;t the need for families to create a system to figure out which toothbrush belongs whom.</li>
            <li> This product is an over-priced piece of junk. I bought it on a deal special. Ha! Some deal. I&#x27;ve had it three or four months, and other than the annoying high pitched whine, it seemed to work fine. Well today, after dinner, I used it, and after rinsing, I noticed little black specs and pieces in the sink. I&#x27;m like WTF! I didn&#x27;t eat anything black! I look at the toothbrush and lo and behold, it&#x27;s falling apart at the bottom!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had misgivings about the quality of this when I first got got it because the handle was really light and the brush head didn&#x27;t fit flush against the handle. I have a Braun Oral B, and the brush heads fit flush with no cheap and ill-fitting rubber washer. I&#x27;ve had the Braun over 10 years, and it works and is still in one piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this product, it is expensive, but is of poor quality. Invest your money elsewhere. I&#x27;m going to try this one [[ASIN:B002CVTVVY Philips Sonicare HX6972/10 FlexCare Plus Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]</li>
            <li> the light bulb inside was dead upon arrival. The new one they replaced lasted 1 month. Then the tooth brush itself fell apart. Oh Please is there really something good about this devise?</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  I&#x27;ve used a more well-known brand for years and got a Jager about a year ago and have to say, I like this one better.  The brush head design is great for reaching all areas of the mouth and it feels a lot less jarring in my mouth and in my hand than the \\&quot;other\\&quot; brush and my teeth feel fabulously clean when I&#x27;m done.  It&#x27;s also nice looking and goes in my bathroom nicely, doesn&#x27;t take up a ton of counter space like the \\&quot;other\\&quot; brush and base, AND the little blue light on it acts as the perfect nightlight!  I&#x27;m definitely not sorry I switched over to the Jager.</li>
            <li> My teeth felt like a glass!!! Shiny. Will buy more for my family members!!!!! I don&#x27;t keep it on charge 24/7. Only once-twice a week!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought set of two toothbrushes for myself and my husband. I was very exited to try it out after reading description.&lt;br /&gt;So nothing special, cheap materials. 6 months later my toothbrush&#x27;s battery was completely dead. O, and by the way, it does have a limited warranty - Just 3 months! Well, I thought maybe it was just my bad luck, anything could happen, but three months after that second toothbrush stopped holding charge as well!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> I have had Jager Bling Sonic brush for 5 months and it no longer holds a charge. Im just over the warranty period and its money wasted</li>
            <li> I liked this product at first, but it kept getting harder and harder to get the toothbrush head off after each use for sanitizing.  At 2 months post purchase it simply wouldn&#x27;t come off, even with all my and my husband&#x27;s force.  They sent a replacement.  Now 2 months later, the same thing has happened.  My husband finally wrenched the toothbrush head off, and now I am forced to only put it halfway on so that I can be sure of getting it off again. We&#x27;ve never had this problem with any other electric toothbrush, and we&#x27;ve had lots in our family over the years!  Do NOT buy this product.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor: don&#x27;t buy this crap. This so-called Dr. Raymond is getting rich by ripping off well-meaning consumers!</li>
            <li> I have been an electric toothbrush fan for many years. The most recent was the Oral B brush which has rotating heads. Through a divorce I found it an opportunity to try something new and was very intriqued that the dentist suggested a sonic toothbrush as the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I did not have the money for the Philips brand and I stumbled upon Amazon&#x27;s Local voucher program and bought this very brand for under $100. Took me a few weeks to figure out how the system worked but I got it none the less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charges the same way as the oral B brand but I really love the UV light sanitization (the brush heads are held against a light bulb to burn off any little microbes). I think the tooth brush works great, but I can&#x27;t find replacment heads anywhere so to continue with the toothbrush I will have to order straight from the company. The allure is the heads are currently $15.00 which is cheaper than the oral b I was buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four stars because they don&#x27;t have replacement heads. I havent compared it to other sonic toothbrushes since this is my first one. However I am quite satisfied, but if you want easy replacement heads stick to the well known brand.</li>
            <li> After four months the battery barely holds enough of a charge for one brushing. Other than that it seems to brush okay. Next time I will try a more reputable brand.</li>
            <li> I bought six toothbrushes direct from the Bling Dental Product website. Within three months of gifting them to others, I have had to replace two of the six brushes (one wouldn&#x27;t charge and the other wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge). So, I reached out to the company&#x27;s customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes the company&#x27;s customer service two business days to respond to e-mails - whether it is to send out their &amp;#34;required trouble shooting procedures&amp;#34; or to reply back after they asked for clarification on a shipping address. My e-mail was finally replied to after I left a voicemail with their customer service (there was not an option to hold for a representative).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After going through all of that, only then will you learn that they have a policy of charging customers to pay return shipping on their faulty products (if more than 30 days after purchase).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the limited product quality and equally lackluster customer support - do yourself a favor and go elsewhere for your toothbrush needs.</li>
            <li> For a product as crappy as this, we should be able to give it negative stars - one star is just too good.  I wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing. I looked in the paperwork and on their site and couldn&#x27;t find any reference to a warranty, but apparently other reviewers attempted to return it and found that it was 90 days.  They also mention that they will sell you a replacement for $50.  It&#x27;s worth about 50 cents as far as I can tell.  I used mine about once a week and after 4 months, it wouldn&#x27;t stay on for more than 10 seconds at a time. After about 4-ten second intervals, it completely stopped. I kind of suspected it was cheesy when I read all the self-promotion by the dentist whose company sells them. Too bad I didn&#x27;t read that stuff before I spent the money. You can pick up an Oral B or Sonicare for under $100 with a reasonable warranty.  I&#x27;ve had my Oral B for about 20 years and my Sonicare for at least 10 - both still work just fine.</li>
