            <li>I was so excited to receive this because of all the awesome reviews so imagine my disappointment when it fizzled not literally</li>
            <li>My stylist recommended this deep conditioner to me and ever since I&#x27;ve started using it, I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>i really recommended at all!</li>
            <li>The Hydration is deep and replenishes the nutrients that the hair needs to be healthy.</li>
            <li>It looks like Potion 9 and because the price is better, I have fallen for it multiple times.  </li>
            <li>I had much better results with affirm deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, I saw no major changes in the condition of my processed hair.</li>
            <li>Left my natural hair silky smooth and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t have good luck with masques, and I thought I was buying Potion 9, not</li>
            <li>Your hair will be more manageable while you blow dry it.  </li>
            <li>Love how my hair looks after I blow dry and style.</li>
            <li>my favorite condition when my hair is really dry.</li>
            <li>If you damage your hair this product can certainly help.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li>It has really helped my hair.</li>
            <li>my hair thanks.</li>
            <li>I love it and use it almost every week, even tho my salon said every other week was sufficient.  </li>
            <li>Has not helped much with my dead ends like my stylist said it would, but my hair is super smooth and shiny after I use it.</li>
            <li>But it does make your hair pretty soft.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this conditioner!</li>
            <li>Took my hair from dry and crunchy to sleek and smooth.</li>
            <li>his fur is very soft!</li>
            <li>For my daughter of mixed ethnicity and for my natural hair, I can tell a significant difference.  </li>
            <li>I think I started to lose a little more hair that I ussually do after using this product</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and silky and very manageable.</li>
            <li>Wow it&#x27;s so much chemicals in there</li>
            <li>This has restored my hair completely!</li>
            <li>I have curly/ frizzy and colored treated hair and this has completely changed the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li>This is the only conditioner I have found that really makes a difference is how my hair looks and feels.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair ultra soft and shinny.</li>
            <li>This product moisturizes my hair and leaves it soft and shinny.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair fairly soft and detangles well, but I prefer Nioxen&#x27;s mask.</li>
            <li>My hair absolutely looks different since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li>and it is soft again.</li>
            <li>noticed how soft my hair was.  </li>
            <li>This is the third bottle I&#x27;ve ordered, I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Really does last long time.</li>
            <li>I always order early before I run out of current bottle.  </li>
            <li>but it sure helps making wavy hair look less messy.</li>
            <li>This product is awsome, you feel it from the very begining, my hair was dry because of the color treatments and instantly recovers its shiness</li>
            <li>I Love this Sebastian Repair Masque for my thin, dry hair.</li>

            <li> It makes my hair soft and silky and very manageable.</li>
            <li> Wow it&#x27;s so much chemicals in there</li>
            <li> This has restored my hair completely!</li>
            <li> I have curly/ frizzy and colored treated hair and this has completely changed the texture of my hair.</li>

            <li> Leaves my hair ultra soft and shinny.</li>
            <li> This product moisturizes my hair and leaves it soft and shinny.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair fairly soft and detangles well, but I prefer Nioxen&#x27;s mask.</li>
            <li> My hair absolutely looks different since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> and it is soft again.</li>
            <li> noticed how soft my hair was.  </li>
            <li> This is the third bottle I&#x27;ve ordered, I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Really does last long time.</li>
            <li> I always order early before I run out of current bottle.  </li>
            <li> but it sure helps making wavy hair look less messy.</li>
            <li> This product is awsome, you feel it from the very begining, my hair was dry because of the color treatments and instantly recovers its shiness</li>
            <li> I Love this Sebastian Repair Masque for my thin, dry hair.</li>
            <li> I usually put it on and then go under the hair dryer for 20 mins so the product can really soak in.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair really soft and manageable while not weighing my hair down.  </li>
            <li> It is just one thing I will like to add; I expected a cellophane  lasting shine!</li>
            <li> Use this conditioner for my every other week deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t straightened my hair for a very long time</li>
            <li> I have curly dry hair.</li>

            <li> HELPS DRY HAIR</li>
            <li> WITH DRY, FRIZZY, CURLY HAIR</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful and extremely annoying because I have to unscrew the top and get it out, which because of how thick it is, is not an easy or pleasant task while showering.</li>
            <li> only need a dab of this product or your hair will be  weighed down.</li>
            <li> I put it in my hair when it is wet after I shower.  </li>
            <li> and when I want to wear my hair curly wet</li>
            <li> Extremely satisfied!&lt;br</li>

            <li> My hair is thick, coarse, and color treated.</li>
            <li> I use as a conditioner everyday</li>

            <li> say the difference to the common shampoo is great!&lt;br /&gt;Use hidden them to wash my dog</li>
            <li> I went in for my usual 2 month appointment at the Salon and the hairdresser</li>
            <li> I do: I usually leave it for about 10 min under a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to give you the wrong impression that this will straighten your hair to look like a flat iron would because it doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> This has repaired my over-permed hair with its frizziness and dryness to the point where I can hardly believe it&#x27;s my hair.  </li>
            <li> Been using this for approximately the 5 years.</li>
            <li> I keep buying the wrong product.  </li>
            <li> I would not purchase this again because the results were not impressive.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I won&#x27;t go without this conditioner. I am a salon blonde and spend many days on the ocean where my hair would become a tangled disaster! Penetraitt keeps that from happening!  It still gets tangled but NOTHING like it does without it!  Love love love!!!</li>
            <li> A great product and have bought it for many years</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! This is the third bottle I&#x27;ve ordered, I can&#x27;t live without it. I use this everytime I wash my hair which is every third day. After shampooing, I leave this product in for about 3-5minutes while I shave etc. I have curly/ frizzy and colored treated hair and this has completely changed the texture of my hair. Amazon has the best price.</li>
            <li> One of the BEST conditioners I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Everythin all right. On time perfect conditions.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this deep conditioner to me and ever since I&#x27;ve started using it, I fell in love with it. It makes my hair soft and silky and very manageable.</li>
            <li> This has restored my hair completely! Even my hair dresser was amazed. Took my hair from dry and crunchy to sleek and smooth. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Best leave-in conditioner ever. Comb it through your hair after shower and it keeps your hair silky smooth all day!</li>
            <li> My hair totally soaks this conditioner up! My hair stylist recommended this to me, as this is what she uses at home and at her salon. My hair just keeps wanting more! she even told me for extra conditioning, to put some on and let it soak for like 10-15 minutes, and then to wash it out.</li>
            <li> My wifes hair never looked beter</li>
            <li> I love,love,live it. It works great!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome!, excellent experience with this product.! i really recommended at all! i love it!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;fulfill my expectations at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good Package</li>
            <li> Great product! my hair hair is silky now! I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping. i definitely recommend this product. It smells great!</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S OK- SMELLS GOOD- BUT LEAVES MY HAIR FLYAWAY</li>
            <li> Extremely satisfied!&lt;br /&gt;My hair never felt or looked better!  Used to be frizzy and tangle in the back and that&#x27;s no longer a problem.  I haven&#x27;t straightened my hair for a very long time and i love, love it! I don&#x27;t want to give you the wrong impression that this will straighten your hair to look like a flat iron would because it doesn&#x27;t but it sure helps making wavy hair look less messy.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I always order early before I run out of current bottle.  Been using this for approximately the 5 years. I have curly dry hair. This adds softness moisture and above all controls frizzy hair. Really does last long time.</li>
            <li> This is the best masque ever. Never seen anything like this before. I have used many famous brands but nothing repairs my blond hair like this.</li>
            <li> Is a great product I highly recommend</li>
            <li> Perfect ! My hair love it !</li>
            <li> Best conditioner ever!</li>
            <li> It came on time and my hair is not damage anymore. I loved it so much and recommended it. Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> This is the only conditioner I have found that really makes a difference is how my hair looks and feels.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect as a mask or a regular condition. I have dry ends and treated hair and it works really good. I use as a conditioner everyday</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t have good luck with masques, and I thought I was buying Potion 9, not a masque.(Completely my error)  Since I already had it, I went ahead and used.  It is really great!  Lees tangles,softer hair, and it smells good.  I will probably continue to use this (accidental) purchase, and will probably buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Amazing! I love how my hair looks after using this product. Definitely would recommend. Leaves my hair ultra soft and shinny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, I saw no major changes in the condition of my processed hair. It didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;save&amp;#34; it, or work some miracle. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Im liking it leaves my hair soft an good hopibg it helps me reconstruct my hair from the died end</li>
            <li> Wow it&#x27;s so much chemicals in there that are very bad for you. But it does make your hair pretty soft. I think I started to lose a little more hair that I ussually do after using this product</li>
            <li> One of my favorite products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The smell is amazing and lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s delivered on time, exactly like what you would get in a high end salon for less.&lt;br /&gt;You only need a dab of this product or your hair will be  weighed down.</li>
            <li> I am hispanic with coarse hair and I use hair relaxer cremes. This product moisturizes my hair and leaves it soft and shinny. I&#x27;m in love with it!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This repair masque is great to use with the conditioner.  If you damage your hair this product can certainly help.  It will make your hair feel so much better.  You just leave it on for a couple minutes in the shower and then rinse it out.  Your hair will be more manageable while you blow dry it.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I had used this product before but forgot how good it is. I have a lot of hair and it detangles it easily. Great smell and leaves hair shiny.</li>
            <li> Love the product itself, maybe the best I have ever used. That said,  the pump doesn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s awful and extremely annoying because I have to unscrew the top and get it out, which because of how thick it is, is not an easy or pleasant task while showering.</li>
            <li> Super mask for my colored hair... And the shampoo too!</li>
            <li> It is a good product to use.  It does what it said on the container.  It is just one thing I will like to add; I expected a cellophane  lasting shine!</li>
            <li> The product is perfect for damaged hair. I recommend! The Hydration is deep and replenishes the nutrients that the hair needs to be healthy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s time to order more, great stuff</li>
            <li> Very good product. I have a salon and use this product. The customers use to like a lot .. .</li>
            <li> My hair is healthy and shinny.  I love this product!!! I use it once a week. My hair was damaged and now it is growing back.</li>
            <li> excellent product, delivered on time</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner.. Seems to be working great.  I put it in my hair when it is wet after I shower.  I leave it in all day.  It makes my hair really soft and manageable while not weighing my hair down.  I can&#x27;t live without this conditioner!</li>
            <li> Amazing scent and even better results for hopelessly damaged hair. I&#x27;d recommend this for chemically damaged hair; it restores durability.</li>
            <li> love this product leaves my hair super soft</li>
            <li> I Love this Sebastian Repair Masque for my thin, dry hair. It makes my hair so soft and smooth, this product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Works great and smells great. I use it twice a week to keep my hair hydrated and after coloring my hair to help the dye last longer (have stubborn gray hair) I notice that using a deep conditioner after hair dye helps to seal in the color helping it to last longer.</li>
            <li> HELPS DRY HAIR YOU NEED IT!!! ONCE A WEEK ONLY!</li>
            <li> My all time favorite conditioner! Can&#x27;t beat this smell and I got it so quickly :)</li>
            <li> Use this conditioner for my every other week deep conditioner. Makes my hair soft and more manageable. I order this product over and over again!</li>
            <li> Let my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair fairly soft and detangles well, but I prefer Nioxen&#x27;s mask.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it leaves my hair silky smooth. and when I want to wear my hair curly wet I just leave the conditioner in and my hair curls up beautifully</li>
            <li> Best product from all Sebastian.</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife and daughters!&lt;br /&gt;They say the difference to the common shampoo is great!&lt;br /&gt;Use hidden them to wash my dog ​​and his fur is very soft! kkkkk</li>
            <li> This has repaired my over-permed hair with its frizziness and dryness to the point where I can hardly believe it&#x27;s my hair.  I love it and use it almost every week, even tho my salon said every other week was sufficient.  I don&#x27;t like the way my hair feels when I don&#x27;t use it, so every week it is.  It has really helped my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, coarse, and color treated. I use this Repair masque once or twice a week. My hair absolutely looks different since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> This product is awsome, you feel it from the very begining, my hair was dry because of the color treatments and instantly recovers its shiness and it is soft again.</li>
            <li> great product excellent</li>
            <li> I have use this product before and I recommend to use evey other week. Extremely good for damage hair. Even though my hair it&#x27;s not damage I only have hair dye but I use it to prevent any damage. I have been using this for more than 10 years</li>
            <li> the best product for  hair</li>
            <li> I have tried many different deep conditioners for my dry hair, but this is the best for me, by far!</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll be using this stuff until I die.  I use this stuff every time I wash my hair. So that&#x27;s about 3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;Penatrait is a rich cream with a beautiful scent.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love Sebastian hair products.  After hearing so many positive reviews on Penetraitt Shampoo and Conditioner I just had to try the Penetraitt.  I am very pleased with this product, my hair has never been softer and is more shiny.  I went in for my usual 2 month appointment at the Salon and the hairdresser noticed how soft my hair was.  I have never received that compliment from a stylist. I also love the scent.  Not overpowering, a mild \\&quot;clean\\&quot; scent. Works great on my long, fine, straight hair. Love how my hair looks after I blow dry and style.</li>
            <li> very good. my hair thanks.</li>
            <li> Wow this product is amazing! My hair was falling out and now its stronger than ever! I love it I usually put it on and then go under the hair dryer for 20 mins so the product can really soak in.</li>
            <li> This is One of The best product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy thanks:-)!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent - Item delivered on time, was as described, great customer service</li>
            <li> This is a great product for dry and chemically damage hair. But its always better under the dryer i use it about once every two weeks</li>
            <li> Yes, best product hands down, in fact im in love with all sebastian hair products. But the penetraitt deep strengthening and repair masque works miracles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was heavily damaged (color treated, frizzy, brittle and thin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do: I usually leave it for about 10 min under a hair dryer. after shampooing and conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will definitely see results almost immediately. My hair was very short and after using it for about 3 months my hair looks healthier, no more frizz, no split ends and my hair is longer than ever !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Smells amazing, leaves your hair nice and soft and healthy looking&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Its pricey ! but its worth every penny. Its a great investment !!</li>
            <li> I always will have one of those! Amazing product!&lt;br /&gt;I just apply in my hair and leave! The result is really good!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it probably once a week and it is keeps my hear super healthy and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> Eu adorei! Assim que você passa, ja da pra sentir o cabelo mais macio! E depois que o cabelo seca com o produto, ja fica brilhoso.. E na hora que tira, então.. Parece um novo cabelo!!</li>
            <li> Love the smell.  Does a great job.</li>
            <li> I keep buying the wrong product.  It looks like Potion 9 and because the price is better, I have fallen for it multiple times.  It is a good product though, I use it now that I have it again .</li>
            <li> For my daughter of mixed ethnicity and for my natural hair, I can tell a significant difference.  Makes hair feel soft, conditioned and more manageable.  Love this product.  Smells Awesome!</li>
            <li> Overrated. I was so excited to receive this because of all the awesome reviews so imagine my disappointment when it fizzled not literally but it did nothing spectacular as I was expecting. I had much better results with affirm deep conditioner. I would not purchase this again because the results were not impressive.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, my hair is shinier and softer after using this product.</li>
            <li> Left my natural hair silky smooth and easy to manage. I sat under the dryer with a plastic cap before rinsing and styling. I used it in conjunction with some heat protectants and the instyler. Best conditioner to date, and I&#x27;ve tried several.i find One &#x27;n Only Brazilian Tech Keratin, to be comparable but not as good, but a cheaper substitute if need be. But this is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!! AMAZING!!! WONDERFUL .....</li>
            <li> my favorite condition when my hair is really dry.</li>
            <li> Has not helped much with my dead ends like my stylist said it would, but my hair is super smooth and shiny after I use it.</li>
            <li> I HAVE CURLY HAIR AND THIS PRODUCT MADE MY HAIR SMOOTH, STRAIGHT AND SHINY?&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!!!! ITS SMELLS AMAZING TOO?&lt;br /&gt;ANYONE WITH DRY, FRIZZY, CURLY HAIR I HIGHLY RECOMMEND PENETRAITT! :-)</li>
