            <li>Hello i would like to order your product to germany, but i tried many times to order it</li>
            <li>Sincerely,  Ikram</li>
            <li>Or maybe you might wait more time between step 2 and 3, for the product to act longer in the hair.  </li>

            <li>and it&#x27;s sooooo much better.</li>
            <li>This product is okay.  </li>
            <li>I used an online translator to figure out what the instructions were saying, but I&#x27;m sure some things got lost in translation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad for those who this worked for; it was not a product for me.  </li>
            <li>ok...</li>
            <li>my instructor tested it with some sort of device when I was in beauty school about 15 years ago and it was the strongest and the most elastic in the class</li>
            <li>With the help of a brush, begin to apply, lock to lock, the neck, going in direction to the top of the head</li>
            <li>With the help of a brush, begin to apply, lock to lock, the neck, going in direction to the top of the head</li>
            <li>YOU WILL NEED TO PAY FOR MORE.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>i love it very much my hair so good now.</li>
            <li>Before that, I did some search on the product reputation in Brazil....which I found is pretty good.   </li>
            <li>It took me 3 hours to complete all phases and I couldn&#x27;t believe how great was the result.</li>
            <li>Easy to do</li>
            <li>that is not so strong, so I can do the process myself with no problems.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong.</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t handle strong chemicals well, you might want to run a fan while you are doing this or you could get some non prescription contacts...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard they help block out strong chemicals and onions and</li>
            <li>I left it on for three hours before rinsing because my hair is resistant to almost every thing, and it turned out beautifully.</li>
            <li>My overall experience was great.</li>
            <li>but I did use in conjunction with a sulfate free keratin shampoo and conditioner to ensure I got the longest</li>
            <li>i followed the directions which were given in english in a separate sheet &amp; got great results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keratin Infusion Smooth and Shine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed that i got some free highlights as an added bonus...</li>
            <li>The process was easy the instructions very straight forward and easy to follow.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty sure that I will go with the do-yourself on that from now on...</li>
            <li>GET YOUR MONEYS WORTH!</li>
            <li>easy blow drying for straight look and the product smelled great after the final rinse.    </li>
            <li>even when I go back to Brazil for good.</li>
            <li>So, you definitely want to use the mask, and it would have been wise to use eye protection too.</li>
            <li>one close family friend even said it looked good enough to be wig hair!  </li>
            <li>Then, take the customer to the washbasin, preferably with cool water.</li>
            <li>Then, take the customer to the washbasin, preferably with cool water.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, for my hair which is medium length (shoulders), I could save half for another application :-)  </li>
            <li>The salon treatment leaves a lingering chemical smell for about 2 days but its gone quickly.  </li>
            <li>I can control the frizz usually pretty well with argan oil and leave in conditioner, but it takes me about 1 1/2 hours to fix my hair in order to reduce the frizz, which is a huge pain.</li>
            <li>but I really wanted manageable hair that I can style easily.  </li>
            <li>The straightener was easy to use and made my hair very manageable with no frizziness.  </li>
            <li>After hearing rave reviews of Keratin Hair Straightening, I decided to give this one a try since my daughter, that lives out of state, had used this one and had tremendous success with it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1. wash your hair in hot water with the shampoo clean for up to 1 - 04 times.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1. wash your hair in hot water with the shampoo clean for up to 1 - 04 times.</li>
            <li>Very shine, smooth and frizz-free hair.</li>
            <li>It just wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>Make sure all the hair is completely dry.&lt;br /&gt;Step 6.</li>
            <li>Make sure all the hair is completely dry.&lt;br /&gt;Step 6.</li>
            <li>I never write reviews but felt this was definitely worth sharing.</li>
            <li>(yeah right) Serum...</li>
            <li>After using this my hair looked so healthy and shiny despite the super blonde highlights I have.  </li>
            <li>Just a quick blowdry and the hair was completely straight.  </li>
            <li>but i have soft curls to the bottom and the top is straight.</li>
            <li>This is the first time for me i tried this Agi Max Keratin.</li>
            <li>I love this product and will definitely use it again.</li>
            <li>The result was completely straight shiny hair!  </li>
            <li>Well, first let me state</li>
            <li>Product works okay, but if you have a lot of hair, or long hair, one kit is not going to do the job.</li>
            <li>I live in Louisiana and it&#x27;s very hot and very ...</li>
            <li>and I live in a very humid area, right on the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so my hair is pretty darn soft even in the front where my hair didn&#x27;t get very much of the chemicals on it...</li>
            <li>I got soft, sleek hair that was super easy to blow dry.  </li>
            <li>I do dot need to go to the hair salon to straight  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyboby that has curly or frizzy hair to look shiny,silky, and straight.</li>
            <li>Thanks for that</li>
            <li>I wanted my hair to stay straight and not frizz in the afternoon heat.  </li>
            <li>It took forever to do the whole treatment on myself.  </li>
            <li>my hair is not needle straight</li>
            <li>This product worked very well on my daughter&#x27;s hair, but did not work at all on mine.  </li>
            <li>I will try a different kind next time to see if ones better than the other....</li>
            <li>In the first 2weeks,my hair was very soft.</li>
            <li>Other than that this is a top hair product.</li>
            <li>When it came in the mail I was really excited, but it still took me a couple weeks to find the time to actually do it.  </li>
            <li>very well conditioned, dries quickly and smoothly with blow-dryer and round brush, and stays that way even when exposed to high humidity.  </li>
            <li>I have used many straightening products before and this by far was most irritating to my eyes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s affordable and makes my hair soft, shiny and STRAIGHT!</li>
            <li>After the app plank, wait about ten minutes to allow the hair to cool.</li>
            <li>After the app plank, wait about ten minutes to allow the hair to cool.</li>
            <li>I do this treatment not to have a flat hair appearance, but rather to get rid of some some undesirable waves at the back and some frizzy parts at the laterals and top.</li>
            <li>because I actually messed up the process the first time and understand why my hair is super straight the second time around.</li>
            <li>this product definitely has a tremendous amount of &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; in it; as it changed my permanently dyed Black hair to a light brown with reddish highlights.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to flat iron, I can blow dry it and go, and it stays smooth all day!</li>
            <li>The product did  leave my hair very soft and relax my curls..</li>
            <li>The results I got were EXACTLY the same I used to get in Brazil.</li>
            <li>but I did notice the second application my hair was even straighter than the first time.  </li>
            <li>Now, I don&#x27;t think I did the best job, still some curliness in the back where I had trouble straightening (or at least that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m assuming).</li>
            <li>It might have been easier if I had seen the process in a salon first, but this was my only experience.</li>
            <li>I used it just before heading to Key West, and my hair behaved in the hot, humid, &amp; windy weather.</li>
            <li>first of all no english instructors.&lt;br /&gt;second</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t describe it exactly, but it reminds me of a faint rotting kind of smell.  </li>
            <li>There was just enough product to do my full head and have it work properly.  </li>
            <li>However, my hair is not very thick and curly...</li>
            <li>but without the frizz, and if I want to blow dry it straight, it stays straight all day, as well.  </li>
            <li>the product has a pleasant smell, easy to apply, and the fumes were much less than I expected (due to my previous experiences in the hair dresser).</li>
            <li>the specifications oz./ml were clear about it.</li>
            <li>The professional treatment has never affected my color at all.  </li>
            <li>It makes it soft, shining, and healthier.</li>
            <li>And the final result is just what I want - easier to use it straight</li>
            <li>anyways, after i finished the routine, i noticed my hair was frizz-free, soft, shiny and silky.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the sellers for inserting a copy of the instructions in english.</li>
            <li>A salon professional did it on my hair</li>
            <li>My hair is extremely soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>jn consideration that it takes about 3 hours to complete the process.&lt;br</li>
            <li>bigger.&lt;br /&gt;Attention: you definitely will need gloves, and do it outside or with a fan right close to you.</li>
            <li>Thoroughly dry the hair with a hot dryer.</li>
            <li>Thoroughly dry the hair with a hot dryer.</li>
            <li>Although the &amp;#34;relaxed&#x27; hair was straight and silky, the new growth closest to my scalp was only moderately straightened.  </li>
            <li>one thing besides the Protegees instructions is that if you have very long thick hair you are going to need more than one bottle of this or just be really stingy about the under layers of your hair...</li>
            <li>It does an okay job on the hair but the bottles are too small and you can use it only once.  </li>
            <li>It stands straight all day long</li>
            <li>However if I let it airdry there was still a little bit of wave but no frizz and still super shiny.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m of mixed ethnicities and my hair is coarse and very curly.</li>
            <li>I was able to just dry my hair with the dryer - didn&#x27;t have to use the round brush or follow up with the flat iron.</li>
            <li>I bought this as I was generally don&#x27;t have a lot of spare time to go to the salon and sit for hours getting my hair done.  </li>
            <li>The bottles are very tiny...smaller than I expected...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for 3 weeks now, and I think I&#x27;m seeing signs of the waves coming back, but not too much so far.</li>
            <li>If it lasts 2 - 3 months, it will have been worth the trouble.</li>
            <li>Back home, I used to get the keratin blow out with a professional (got it 5X), but not w/ this same brand.</li>
            <li>As an African American, I wanted to transition from relaxed hair to my natural hair; and thought this to be an alternative.  </li>
            <li>I find it quite unpleasant and I sincerely hope this goes away fast.  </li>
            <li>I can get my curls if I want them, but all I needed was a little blow drying to get the straight hair with no frizz I crave.  </li>

            <li> The salon treatment leaves a lingering chemical smell for about 2 days but its gone quickly.  </li>
            <li> I can control the frizz usually pretty well with argan oil and leave in conditioner, but it takes me about 1 1/2 hours to fix my hair in order to reduce the frizz, which is a huge pain.</li>
            <li> but I really wanted manageable hair that I can style easily.  </li>
            <li> The straightener was easy to use and made my hair very manageable with no frizziness.  </li>
            <li> After hearing rave reviews of Keratin Hair Straightening, I decided to give this one a try since my daughter, that lives out of state, had used this one and had tremendous success with it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1. wash your hair in hot water with the shampoo clean for up to 1 - 04 times.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1. wash your hair in hot water with the shampoo clean for up to 1 - 04 times.</li>
            <li> Very shine, smooth and frizz-free hair.</li>
            <li> It just wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> Make sure all the hair is completely dry.&lt;br /&gt;Step 6.</li>
            <li> Make sure all the hair is completely dry.&lt;br /&gt;Step 6.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but felt this was definitely worth sharing.</li>
            <li> (yeah right) Serum...</li>
            <li> After using this my hair looked so healthy and shiny despite the super blonde highlights I have.  </li>
            <li> Just a quick blowdry and the hair was completely straight.  </li>
            <li> but i have soft curls to the bottom and the top is straight.</li>
            <li> This is the first time for me i tried this Agi Max Keratin.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will definitely use it again.</li>
            <li> The result was completely straight shiny hair!  </li>
            <li> Well, first let me state</li>
            <li> Product works okay, but if you have a lot of hair, or long hair, one kit is not going to do the job.</li>
            <li> I live in Louisiana and it&#x27;s very hot and very ...</li>
            <li> and I live in a very humid area, right on the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so my hair is pretty darn soft even in the front where my hair didn&#x27;t get very much of the chemicals on it...</li>
            <li> I got soft, sleek hair that was super easy to blow dry.  </li>
            <li> I do dot need to go to the hair salon to straight  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyboby that has curly or frizzy hair to look shiny,silky, and straight.</li>
            <li> Thanks for that</li>
            <li> I wanted my hair to stay straight and not frizz in the afternoon heat.  </li>
            <li> It took forever to do the whole treatment on myself.  </li>
            <li> my hair is not needle straight</li>
            <li> This product worked very well on my daughter&#x27;s hair, but did not work at all on mine.  </li>
            <li> I will try a different kind next time to see if ones better than the other....</li>
            <li> In the first 2weeks,my hair was very soft.</li>
            <li> Other than that this is a top hair product.</li>
            <li> When it came in the mail I was really excited, but it still took me a couple weeks to find the time to actually do it.  </li>
            <li> very well conditioned, dries quickly and smoothly with blow-dryer and round brush, and stays that way even when exposed to high humidity.  </li>
            <li> I have used many straightening products before and this by far was most irritating to my eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s affordable and makes my hair soft, shiny and STRAIGHT!</li>
            <li> After the app plank, wait about ten minutes to allow the hair to cool.</li>
            <li> After the app plank, wait about ten minutes to allow the hair to cool.</li>
            <li> I do this treatment not to have a flat hair appearance, but rather to get rid of some some undesirable waves at the back and some frizzy parts at the laterals and top.</li>
            <li> because I actually messed up the process the first time and understand why my hair is super straight the second time around.</li>
            <li> this product definitely has a tremendous amount of &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; in it; as it changed my permanently dyed Black hair to a light brown with reddish highlights.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to flat iron, I can blow dry it and go, and it stays smooth all day!</li>
            <li> The product did  leave my hair very soft and relax my curls..</li>
            <li> The results I got were EXACTLY the same I used to get in Brazil.</li>
            <li> but I did notice the second application my hair was even straighter than the first time.  </li>
            <li> Now, I don&#x27;t think I did the best job, still some curliness in the back where I had trouble straightening (or at least that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m assuming).</li>
            <li> It might have been easier if I had seen the process in a salon first, but this was my only experience.</li>
            <li> I used it just before heading to Key West, and my hair behaved in the hot, humid, &amp; windy weather.</li>
            <li> first of all no english instructors.&lt;br /&gt;second</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t describe it exactly, but it reminds me of a faint rotting kind of smell.  </li>
            <li> There was just enough product to do my full head and have it work properly.  </li>
            <li> However, my hair is not very thick and curly...</li>
            <li> but without the frizz, and if I want to blow dry it straight, it stays straight all day, as well.  </li>
            <li> the product has a pleasant smell, easy to apply, and the fumes were much less than I expected (due to my previous experiences in the hair dresser).</li>
            <li> the specifications oz./ml were clear about it.</li>
            <li> The professional treatment has never affected my color at all.  </li>
            <li> It makes it soft, shining, and healthier.</li>
            <li> And the final result is just what I want - easier to use it straight</li>
            <li> anyways, after i finished the routine, i noticed my hair was frizz-free, soft, shiny and silky.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the sellers for inserting a copy of the instructions in english.</li>
            <li> A salon professional did it on my hair</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> jn consideration that it takes about 3 hours to complete the process.&lt;br</li>
            <li> bigger.&lt;br /&gt;Attention: you definitely will need gloves, and do it outside or with a fan right close to you.</li>
            <li> Thoroughly dry the hair with a hot dryer.</li>
            <li> Thoroughly dry the hair with a hot dryer.</li>
            <li> Although the &amp;#34;relaxed&#x27; hair was straight and silky, the new growth closest to my scalp was only moderately straightened.  </li>
            <li> one thing besides the Protegees instructions is that if you have very long thick hair you are going to need more than one bottle of this or just be really stingy about the under layers of your hair...</li>
            <li> It does an okay job on the hair but the bottles are too small and you can use it only once.  </li>
            <li> It stands straight all day long</li>
            <li> However if I let it airdry there was still a little bit of wave but no frizz and still super shiny.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m of mixed ethnicities and my hair is coarse and very curly.</li>
            <li> I was able to just dry my hair with the dryer - didn&#x27;t have to use the round brush or follow up with the flat iron.</li>
            <li> I bought this as I was generally don&#x27;t have a lot of spare time to go to the salon and sit for hours getting my hair done.  </li>
            <li> The bottles are very tiny...smaller than I expected...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for 3 weeks now, and I think I&#x27;m seeing signs of the waves coming back, but not too much so far.</li>
            <li> If it lasts 2 - 3 months, it will have been worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> Back home, I used to get the keratin blow out with a professional (got it 5X), but not w/ this same brand.</li>
            <li> As an African American, I wanted to transition from relaxed hair to my natural hair; and thought this to be an alternative.  </li>
            <li> I find it quite unpleasant and I sincerely hope this goes away fast.  </li>
            <li> I can get my curls if I want them, but all I needed was a little blow drying to get the straight hair with no frizz I crave.  </li>
            <li> The product has a lot of fumes, especially when you brush it through or flat iron it in.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions, used my flat iron</li>
            <li> my hair up with the hair dryer or flat iron.</li>
            <li> just didn&#x27;t last long at all, about 2 months if that.  </li>
            <li> my eyes and nose watered during the flat ironing stage</li>
            <li> flat ironing will no longer be so time consuming.</li>
            <li> Now takes me 15 min to flat iron my hair instead of 40.</li>
            <li> It did take the frizz out of my hair and it was definitely easier to style and dry.  </li>
            <li> Dry your hair with your fingers only, without brush, to view the result from treatment</li>
            <li> Dry your hair with your fingers only, without brush, to view the result from treatment Kear-X System.</li>
            <li> Strong chemical smell was disturbing.</li>
            <li> The overall finish is not quite as glossy as with the salon treatment, but the difference is minimal.  </li>
            <li> The next weeks,it started to be rough.</li>
            <li> The application did not take that long and no problems doing it myself.  </li>
            <li> so the procedure wasnt that long</li>
            <li> that took FOREVER, but I&#x27;d rather be up on my feet that long than spend 400 dollars at the salon...</li>
            <li> just to give you an idea of how thick my hair really is...</li>
            <li> The other thing I noticed is that I had my hair colored the week prior to using this product</li>
            <li> I also followed some of the other reviewers suggestions to use a fan in the room to help with the fumes although I don&#x27;t think it was really necessary.  </li>
            <li> Extensive heat and pulling must be applied for the desired results; which I am not willing to go through again.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very long, about medium thickness and wavy.</li>
            <li> When dry, the hair has no smell, but even a bit of dampness brings the smell out.  </li>
            <li> i really wish the treatment bottle was at least a half size larger though...</li>
            <li> After the treatment, I can air dry my hair with no leave in products and it&#x27;s still wavy</li>
            <li> This review is of the product in green bottles with dark red and white printing.  </li>
            <li> It definitely takes the color out and makes it even a little lighter.  </li>
            <li> If you follow the directions and rinse the conditioner out completely with COLD water your hair will be very shiney and silky.  </li>
            <li> They should consider at least to add Spanish and English on that!!!  </li>
            <li> product lifted my permanent hair color by several shades all over my head in an uneven manner.  </li>
            <li> It was even detectable while my hair was damp with hair color and when wet after a wash.  </li>
            <li> , not much smell at all.  </li>
            <li> I still have curls when hair is wet</li>
            <li> and I have dye,, highlights and pink streaks in my hair, and it did not damage my hair....</li>
            <li> I bought it because it is the same product I used to pay a couple of hundred bucks for them to put on the beauty parlor, but the bottles are really small and I am not sure the effect lasted long enough.</li>
            <li> Containers are extremely small, and it was barely enough for my not so long hair (slightly longer than shoulder length).</li>
            <li> I was a little surprised at how small the bottles were and was afraid there wouldn&#x27;t actually be enough to do my whole head.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the green bottle formula and was sent the cheaper red bottle formula with the green bottle label on it.</li>
            <li> For the job it does on the hair is not worth the price.  </li>
            <li> think it is for a month and a half only,but my hair color is changing from black to brown.</li>
            <li> My hair Is shinier, healthier, less frizzy and straighter.</li>
            <li> However, the amount of product for the money is way too little.  </li>
            <li> I also have dyed dark brown demi permanent color on my hair and this product did NOT fade my color at all!</li>
            <li> so I wish the kit was a little bit</li>
            <li> This product leaves a really funky stink and each time my hair is wet either while washing or from sweat from a work-out, the bad smell is noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> Here in the U.S. is way too expensive to have a professional doing it for you, so I decided to by the kit and do it myself.</li>
            <li> i blew dried my hair after using the cream rinse that came in the box</li>
            <li> SERIOUSLY THE BOTTLES ARE THE SIZE OF TRAVEL SIZE PANTENE OR ANY OTHER TRAVEL SIZE SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER</li>
            <li> I mean, it worked, for a little while.</li>
            <li> my hair is about three inches past my shoulders and when i grab hold of all of it, it fills my fist...</li>
            <li> It takes a long time (which is why it&#x27;s so expensive in a salon), but it did relax the curl in my hair and make it easier to style.</li>
            <li> Pass the plank at least 5 times on each strand, since the tip of the hair shaping inwards or outwards.&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> Pass the plank at least 5 times on each strand, since the tip of the hair shaping inwards or outwards.&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> well, i have thick wavy shoulder length</li>
            <li> so we shall see if this thinly spread product helps tame my mane</li>
            <li> and I got serious results.  </li>
            <li> Note the regions behind the ear and neck.&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> Note the regions behind the ear and neck.&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> AND 60 BUCKS FOR THIS IS NOT A GREAT DEAL</li>
            <li> IT SMELLS BAD, LEAVES YOUR HAIR DISGUSTINGLY STIFF AND LEAVES RESIDUE LIKE NO ONES BUSINESS!</li>
            <li> There are fumes that are not very pleasant when you blowdry the product on the hair, but if you are in a well ventilated room it&#x27;s not too bad.  </li>
            <li> In this regard, I consider this as comparable to the expensive salon treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Comb your hair and rinse again, preferably con cold water.&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> Comb your hair and rinse again, preferably con cold water.&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> This was a desperate purchase for me because I didn&#x27;t want to spend $350.00 on a salon treatment.</li>
            <li> product makes my hair stink when wet...really unpleasant stink.  </li>
            <li> and it still smells just as bad</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> I have never been so disappointed and upset over a product.  </li>
            <li> The smell - terrible!  </li>
            <li> but OMG the fumes were HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li> horrible thing, it will give your hair orange ish color.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have reviewed this product before and it worked amazing. They&#x27;ve changed it and it&#x27;s not as effective.</li>
            <li> This review is of the product in green bottles with dark red and white printing.  Not sure if this is a formula difference or just packaging difference from product photos showing red bottles.&lt;br /&gt;Followed instructions exactly as per translation from Portuguese.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had 6 Brazilian Blowouts in a salon before, so my review is comparing this product to the results I&#x27;ve received in a salon...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product lifted my permanent hair color by several shades all over my head in an uneven manner.  It was very obvious - looked like I&#x27;d lightened my hair.  The professional treatment has never affected my color at all.  I had to have my entire head re-colored.  Thankfully, the color took well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product did remove the frizz and body from my hair.  Like the salon treatment, my hair is currently (1 week later) very well conditioned, dries quickly and smoothly with blow-dryer and round brush, and stays that way even when exposed to high humidity.  The overall finish is not quite as glossy as with the salon treatment, but the difference is minimal.  In this regard, I consider this as comparable to the expensive salon treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product makes my hair stink when wet...really unpleasant stink.  The salon treatment leaves a lingering chemical smell for about 2 days but its gone quickly.  This product leaves a really funky stink and each time my hair is wet either while washing or from sweat from a work-out, the bad smell is noticeable.  I can&#x27;t describe it exactly, but it reminds me of a faint rotting kind of smell.  When dry, the hair has no smell, but even a bit of dampness brings the smell out.  I find it quite unpleasant and I sincerely hope this goes away fast.  It was even detectable while my hair was damp with hair color and when wet after a wash.  In fact, its been washed 4 times since the application and it still smells just as bad when wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t color your hair and you don&#x27;t mind the smell, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I used the product before and have found it to be one of the best for getting your hair straight.  If you follow the directions and rinse the conditioner out completely with COLD water your hair will be very shiney and silky.  However, the amount of product for the money is way too little.  Go on Ebay; you&#x27;ll spend more but you get a better deal.</li>
            <li> This product is the best fast acting,amazing quality keratin Ive ever tried.What i would have liked is that more cuantity would have been available for me to use. Other than that this is a top hair product.</li>
            <li> This is the first time for me i tried this Agi Max Keratin.In the first 2weeks,my hair was very soft.The next weeks,it started to be rough.I will give it 6 out of 10.I think it is for a month and a half only,but my hair color is changing from black to brown.</li>
            <li> I thought this product was going to be like the brazilian blowout because of all the good reviews. I have never been so disappointed and upset over a product.  Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> Hello i would like to order your product to germany, but i tried many times to order it and it didn&#x27;t work.  What can we do that i can get the product ?    Sincerely,  Ikram</li>
            <li> This product worked great!  I followed the directions, used my flat iron and I got serious results.  I have always had curly hair but I really wanted manageable hair that I can style easily.  I got soft, sleek hair that was super easy to blow dry.  I can get my curls if I want them, but all I needed was a little blow drying to get the straight hair with no frizz I crave.  Easy to do, not much smell at all.  I&#x27;m wondering why it is not in stock but when it is I am buying it again!  Nice!</li>
            <li> I am Brazilian, but living in the U.S for a year. Back home, I used to get the keratin blow out with a professional (got it 5X), but not w/ this same brand. I do this treatment not to have a flat hair appearance, but rather to get rid of some some undesirable waves at the back and some frizzy parts at the laterals and top. In order to save money and not have to wait 4 months to get it done in Brazil again, I decided to give a try. Before that, I did some search on the product reputation in Brazil....which I found is pretty good.   My overall experience was great. I did the procedure by myself...the product has a pleasant smell, easy to apply, and the fumes were much less than I expected (due to my previous experiences in the hair dresser). But you should consider to apply it in an space with good ventilation to avoid watering eyes.   The results I got were EXACTLY the same I used to get in Brazil. Very shine, smooth and frizz-free hair. However, my hair is not very thick and curly...If you have a lot of volume and curls, you might not get the same result I did. Or maybe you might wait more time between step 2 and 3, for the product to act longer in the hair.  The bottles are very tiny...smaller than I expected...Even though the images can be considered deceivers...the specifications oz./ml were clear about it. Surprisingly, for my hair which is medium length (shoulders), I could save half for another application :-)  The only problem is that if you are not a Portuguese speaker, you might have some extra work to translate the instructions. They should consider at least to add Spanish and English on that!!!  I am pretty sure that I will go with the do-yourself on that from now on...even when I go back to Brazil for good.</li>
            <li> It is an amazing product. I do dot need to go to the hair salon to straight  my hair up with the hair dryer or flat iron. I do it by myself at home !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I recommend this product to anyboby that has curly or frizzy hair to look shiny,silky, and straight.</li>
            <li> Ok I have to start off with the product works great for curly/wavy and frizzy hair.  After using this my hair looked so healthy and shiny despite the super blonde highlights I have.  The only problem I had was the instructions were in Portuguese so I had to try and figure things out and use a translator program before using.  The other thing I noticed is that I had my hair colored the week prior to using this product and I did notice that my highlighted portions of hair did turn lighter in color which was ok.  I still have curls when hair is wet but it is manageable and no frizz...easy blow drying for straight look and the product smelled great after the final rinse.    This product lasted for 3 months but I did notice the second application my hair was even straighter than the first time.  I love this product and will continue to use being that it did not damage my hair.  I believe the sellers read this review because this last order included instructions in English.  Thanks for that because I actually messed up the process the first time and understand why my hair is super straight the second time around.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my hair gets frizzy in the summer humidity and we were going to the beach and taking family photos while there.  I wanted my hair to stay straight and not frizz in the afternoon heat.  The straightener was easy to use and made my hair very manageable with no frizziness.  I like that if I want to wear my hair wavy I still can, but without the frizz, and if I want to blow dry it straight, it stays straight all day, as well.  The only thing I would mention is do not color your hair before using this product.  It definitely takes the color out and makes it even a little lighter.  I had just had it colored with medium brown two weeks before using it and my hair was almost blond afterwards.  I did recolor it the next day, even though it said to wait two weeks before coloring, and it held the color and there was no damage.  I love this product and will definitely use it again.</li>
            <li> It took forever to do the whole treatment on myself.  about 3+hours.  The smell - terrible!  It did take the frizz out of my hair and it was definitely easier to style and dry.  just didn&#x27;t last long at all, about 2 months if that.  Too bad.</li>
            <li> This product works great for my hair! It makes it soft, shining, and healthier. I like that is not so strong, so I can do the process myself with no problems. And the final result is just what I want - easier to use it straight and I can still use it curly as well, but with much better curls!</li>
            <li> I live in Louisiana and it&#x27;s very hot and very ...The product did  leave my hair very soft and relax my curls.. which I have curly frizzy frizzy hair...it did not take out all the frizz out.. it&#x27;s a lot easier when I straighten my hair ..over all it was ok..I have never uses a keratin treatment before so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it ...I will try a different kind next time to see if ones better than the other....I also used the instructions from another review. ..</li>
            <li> I FOLLOWED ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS ON THE PAPER GIVEN IN THE PACKAGE AND I ENSURED EVERY STEP WAS FOLLOWED AND MY HAIR DIDNT GET STRAIGHTENED! NOT EVEN FOR THAT DAY!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product twice already and I love love love it. It&#x27;s affordable and makes my hair soft, shiny and STRAIGHT! I&#x27;m of mixed ethnicities and my hair is coarse and very curly. But after this product, I feel like I had a hair transplant. I encourage everyone to buy it!</li>
            <li> I bought this as I was generally don&#x27;t have a lot of spare time to go to the salon and sit for hours getting my hair done.  I had been trying to get around to going and getting a brazilian blowout, but it never happened.  I did some research online and found this product with good reviews so I decided to order it.  When it came in the mail I was really excited, but it still took me a couple weeks to find the time to actually do it.  One of the benefits of a DIY product is you can do it at 2:00 in the morning if you want to which is what I did.  The process was easy the instructions very straight forward and easy to follow.  I was a little surprised at how small the bottles were and was afraid there wouldn&#x27;t actually be enough to do my whole head.  I have hair that almost reaches my waist.  There was just enough product to do my full head and have it work properly.  The application did not take that long and no problems doing it myself.  There are fumes that are not very pleasant when you blowdry the product on the hair, but if you are in a well ventilated room it&#x27;s not too bad.  I also followed some of the other reviewers suggestions to use a fan in the room to help with the fumes although I don&#x27;t think it was really necessary.  The result was completely straight shiny hair!  However if I let it airdry there was still a little bit of wave but no frizz and still super shiny.  Just a quick blowdry and the hair was completely straight.  The results lasted about 3-4 months but I did use in conjunction with a sulfate free keratin shampoo and conditioner to ensure I got the longest results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line for the price and the results I would definitely recommend this product!  I will be ordering more for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh I also have dyed dark brown demi permanent color on my hair and this product did NOT fade my color at all!</li>
            <li> I have used used this product before and I have dye,, highlights and pink streaks in my hair, and it did not damage my hair....Also if anyone needs a translator e-mail me here or at Sapoty63@aol.com....I will gladly help anyone that needs translation,&lt;br /&gt;Elle</li>
            <li> Did not work for me. Possibly something was lost in translation of the instructions. Strong chemical smell was disturbing. I have used many straightening products before and this by far was most irritating to my eyes.</li>
            <li> i love it very much my hair so good now.</li>
            <li> I  have to send this product back because the directions are not in English, so I can understand  how to use the product.</li>
            <li> Now, I don&#x27;t think I did the best job, still some curliness in the back where I had trouble straightening (or at least that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m assuming). I used the translated directions someone in the reviews posted because my box did not have instructions in English (recent reviews said their boxes did). However, 3 weeks later it was like I had never done it and I did follow all the proper post-straightening rules. Followed this with a salon one and it&#x27;s sooooo much better.</li>
            <li> i followed the directions which were given in english in a separate sheet &amp; got great results.&lt;br /&gt;i have short hair so it was simple for me to use this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered the green bottle formula and was sent the cheaper red bottle formula with the green bottle label on it. So I returned it and went with another product.</li>
            <li> does not do it work at all</li>
            <li> This product is okay.  It does an okay job on the hair but the bottles are too small and you can use it only once.  For the job it does on the hair is not worth the price.  I will return it.</li>
            <li> Lasts for only 2 weeks, but makes you hair look like silk</li>
            <li> I used an online translator to figure out what the instructions were saying, but I&#x27;m sure some things got lost in translation. After the translation, I followed the instructions to the best of my understanding. It might have been easier if I had seen the process in a salon first, but this was my only experience. The product has a lot of fumes, especially when you brush it through or flat iron it in. So, you definitely want to use the mask, and it would have been wise to use eye protection too. My eyes would water from the product when I brushed it through at the front. It takes a long time (which is why it&#x27;s so expensive in a salon), but it did relax the curl in my hair and make it easier to style. I used it just before heading to Key West, and my hair behaved in the hot, humid, &amp; windy weather. I was able to just dry my hair with the dryer - didn&#x27;t have to use the round brush or follow up with the flat iron. I&#x27;ve had it for 3 weeks now, and I think I&#x27;m seeing signs of the waves coming back, but not too much so far. If it lasts 2 - 3 months, it will have been worth the trouble. If not, save your money.</li>
            <li> well, i have thick wavy shoulder length indian hear that gets frizzy with the humidity in the caribbean so i decided to purchase this product to try it. so the procedure wasnt that long but OMG the fumes were HORRIBLE! my eyes and nose watered during the flat ironing stage and i had a fan blowing on me the entire time! anyways, after i finished the routine, i noticed my hair was frizz-free, soft, shiny and silky. this is just day one, i hope it lasts the promised 3 months. my hair is not needle straight but i have soft curls to the bottom and the top is straight. flat ironing will no longer be so time consuming. Thanks to the sellers for inserting a copy of the instructions in english.</li>
            <li> Returned after finding translation on instructions.</li>
            <li> great product iwill use it again my hair turned out just what i wanted!!!!!! easy to use at home happy!!!!</li>
            <li> Product works okay, but if you have a lot of hair, or long hair, one kit is not going to do the job. Containers are extremely small, and it was barely enough for my not so long hair (slightly longer than shoulder length).</li>
            <li> I mean, it worked, for a little while. I bought it because it is the same product I used to pay a couple of hundred bucks for them to put on the beauty parlor, but the bottles are really small and I am not sure the effect lasted long enough. Overall, I would buy again, since I don´t want to pay the salon and this I can do at home.</li>
            <li> Great results if you follow the instructions that come with it. I have done it twice on my hair and could but be happier. My hair Is shinier, healthier, less frizzy and straighter. Last time it lasted me 3 months.</li>
            <li> first of all no english instructors.&lt;br /&gt;second horrible thing, it will give your hair orange ish color. you have to dye your again again.</li>
            <li> A lot depends on your hair type.  We both have curly hair.  This product worked very well on my daughter&#x27;s hair, but did not work at all on mine.  It did not take my frizziness away.</li>
            <li> After hearing rave reviews of Keratin Hair Straightening, I decided to give this one a try since my daughter, that lives out of state, had used this one and had tremendous success with it.  Well, first let me state this product definitely has a tremendous amount of &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; in it; as it changed my permanently dyed Black hair to a light brown with reddish highlights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As an African American, I wanted to transition from relaxed hair to my natural hair; and thought this to be an alternative.  Although the &amp;#34;relaxed&#x27; hair was straight and silky, the new growth closest to my scalp was only moderately straightened.  Extensive heat and pulling must be applied for the desired results; which I am not willing to go through again.  I believe the process was too damaging for my already fragile hair.  I&#x27;m glad for those who this worked for; it was not a product for me.  It just wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> I used this product when I was in Brazil, around 4 years ago. A salon professional did it on my hair and I loved the result. Here in the U.S. is way too expensive to have a professional doing it for you, so I decided to by the kit and do it myself. It took me 3 hours to complete all phases and I couldn&#x27;t believe how great was the result. My hair is extremely soft and shiny. Now takes me 15 min to flat iron my hair instead of 40. I have a lot of hair so I wish the kit was a little bit bigger.&lt;br /&gt;Attention: you definitely will need gloves, and do it outside or with a fan right close to you. The smell is strong. I even used a mask.</li>
            <li> I used google translate...here ya go...i will edit this after i use the product to let you know how it works...ok...so i see they have the English instructions on here already...I&#x27;ve got the treatment processing in my hair at the moment...one thing besides the Protegees instructions is that if you have very long thick hair you are going to need more than one bottle of this or just be really stingy about the under layers of your hair...my hair is about three inches past my shoulders and when i grab hold of all of it, it fills my fist...just to give you an idea of how thick my hair really is...my hair is also very strong...my instructor tested it with some sort of device when I was in beauty school about 15 years ago and it was the strongest and the most elastic in the class so we shall see if this thinly spread product helps tame my mane...well I&#x27;m all done...that took FOREVER, but I&#x27;d rather be up on my feet that long than spend 400 dollars at the salon...the product itself burned my eyes like when i cut up onions...if you don&#x27;t handle strong chemicals well, you might want to run a fan while you are doing this or you could get some non prescription contacts...I&#x27;ve heard they help block out strong chemicals and onions and the like that affect the eyes...so my hair is pretty darn soft even in the front where my hair didn&#x27;t get very much of the chemicals on it...it&#x27;s not shiny though like i thought it would be...guess i should dye it to make it shine...i blew dried my hair after using the cream rinse that came in the box and i also added on It&#x27;s A 10 Miracle Leave-In plus Keratin and Suave Keratin Infusion Smooth and Shine (yeah right) Serum...I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and will probably use it again...i really wish the treatment bottle was at least a half size larger though...just wanted to add that everyone has been complimenting me on my hair...one close family friend even said it looked good enough to be wig hair!  I&#x27;ve also noticed that i got some free highlights as an added bonus...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1. wash your hair in hot water with the shampoo clean for up to 1 - 04 times.

            <li> THIS STUFF DOES NOT I REPEAT DOE SNOT WORK FOR S***! IT SMELLS BAD, LEAVES YOUR HAIR DISGUSTINGLY STIFF AND LEAVES RESIDUE LIKE NO ONES BUSINESS! SERIOUSLY THE BOTTLES ARE THE SIZE OF TRAVEL SIZE PANTENE OR ANY OTHER TRAVEL SIZE SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER SO IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF HAIR YOU WILL NEED TO PAY FOR MORE. AND 60 BUCKS FOR THIS IS NOT A GREAT DEAL WHAT SO EVER. ID SAY, SKIP, AND GO TO A SALON. GET YOUR MONEYS WORTH!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this product. I had wavy hair, and now I don&#x27;t even have to use a hair drier. It stands straight all day long and I live in a very humid area, right on the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take jn consideration that it takes about 3 hours to complete the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This was a desperate purchase for me because I didn&#x27;t want to spend $350.00 on a salon treatment. My hair is very long, about medium thickness and wavy. I can control the frizz usually pretty well with argan oil and leave in conditioner, but it takes me about 1 1/2 hours to fix my hair in order to reduce the frizz, which is a huge pain. After the treatment, I can air dry my hair with no leave in products and it&#x27;s still wavy but there&#x27;s no frizz! It makes my hair &#x27;skinny&#x27;. I don&#x27;t have to flat iron, I can blow dry it and go, and it stays smooth all day! I will definitely be purchasing this again! It came with instructions in English, and it says to only leave product on for an hour before rinsing. I left it on for three hours before rinsing because my hair is resistant to almost every thing, and it turned out beautifully. I never write reviews but felt this was definitely worth sharing. I hope you guys all have the same experience I have had with this product!</li>
