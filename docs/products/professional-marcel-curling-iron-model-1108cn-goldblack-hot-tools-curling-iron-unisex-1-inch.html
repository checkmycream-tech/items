            <li>Love this curling iron!</li>
            <li>Love this curling iron!</li>
            <li>I think Hot Tools is the best brand of curling irons.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this iron for years, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing iron.</li>
            <li>but once u do it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving this marcel curling iron.</li>
            <li>She wanted one for herself and was thrilled with it.</li>
            <li>, also nice that it has an adjustable heat setting.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Hot Tools 1 inch professional marcel curling iron, the price was perfect and the iron is the best.  </li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t hold curl worth anything, but with this iron, every day is a good hair day!</li>
            <li>Wish the cord was better but love everything else!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best curling iron I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>but honestly I prefer the option to be able to use the handle for tips of the hair</li>
            <li>This is by far the best curling iron I have ever used!</li>
            <li>Love love love this curling iron!</li>
            <li>It took me a while to get used to the handle on this curling iron and not being able to touch the tip, but once I was able to get the hang of it, I love it!</li>
            <li>This iron does a great job of creating the exact look</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great that I know how hot the curling iron is, so that I ensure that I don&#x27;t sizzle my hair.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better then the spring handle</li>
            <li>I love that you can set the temperature you want as well as release the handle to spin as you release the curl.</li>
            <li>I have used this brand of iron for many years.  </li>
            <li>With different heat settings its perfect for all hair types.</li>
            <li>Most curling irons have a tip at the end that one can hold onto.  </li>
            <li>My rating has to do more with ease of use than the quality, love the varying tempatures and the way my curls look.</li>
            <li>It gives you such perfect, voluminous curls.</li>
            <li>My favorite.....  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m am soooooo glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li>you will love them in all sizes</li>
            <li>It is better to use on others, but my hair stylist used it on me, and I fell in love with the curls.</li>
            <li>but once you do, its fantastic!</li>
            <li>Love this iron.  </li>
            <li>Perfect size for multiple styles.</li>
            <li>That may just take some more getting used to.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have it on the highest heat setting and it does a phenomenal job.</li>
            <li>I love the waves and body you achieve from a marcel iron.</li>
            <li>I purchased the 1&amp;#34; barrel - curls are bigger than I thought they&#x27;d be but the wavey/curly look is perfect for day-to-day wear.</li>
            <li>plus i love the marcel design</li>
            <li>Return was very easy and the seller was extremely nice and quick to reply.</li>
            <li>it worked great, it warms up quick and stays hot.</li>
            <li>Great professional tool</li>
            <li>I ordered the 1.5 inch and loved it so much I had to have the 1 inch.</li>
            <li>The lever does not have a spring and is on the opposite side of most curling irons--this takes some getting used too, but is great once you get used to it.</li>
            <li>it does not move  as easily.  </li>
            <li>But this is a professional tool, best left for hair stylists and not someone curling their own hair at home.</li>
            <li>I like the one I have now just fine.</li>
            <li>Love how hot it gets and love how comfortable it is in my hand.</li>
            <li>I am hair stylist so the marcel hot tools is perfect for me, if you are comfortable with that type of handle this iron is a classic favorite of stylist, now I have been tempted to get the no handle new style of iron</li>
            <li>I love hot tools!  </li>
            <li>IMPORTANT TIP:  </li>
            <li>Handle material is somewhat soft and provides a good grip for holding.  </li>
            <li>you enjoy as much as I am!!!</li>
            <li>This gets hot fast and makes gorgeous curls.</li>
            <li>I love the Hot Tools brand.</li>
            <li>There is nothing more embarrassing than holding your cord in a certain position trying to make the light stay on while finishing a client.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and gives you curls in just seconds, plus it&#x27;s so easy to use!  </li>
            <li>I returned this product immediately for a full refund.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought Hot Tools almost ever since becoming a Hairstylist 18 years ago.</li>
            <li>Nice professional iron.</li>
            <li>The sales price was full price, $40.  </li>
            <li>I cannot fathom anyone selling an item at full price and saying it is unreturnable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like that it doesn&#x27;t have a cool touch tip on it either.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a curling iron like this, it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>and it is seriously the best curling iron I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several different ones before and this is the best.</li>
            <li>I have purchased many of these over the course of 5 years mainly cuz I misplace them</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and the temperature range fits any hair tpye.</li>
            <li>Also, if you hair doesn&#x27;t hold well, like mine, my stylist recommended Kendra 25 super hold finishing spray</li>
            <li>Gets VERY hot, but I don&#x27;t hear my hair cracking like it&#x27;s about to set on fire.</li>
            <li>I will always use Hot Tools!</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this curling wand!!</li>
            <li>Incredible hard to use.</li>
            <li>I learned pretty quickly - I&#x27;d say about an hour or less of watching youtube and practicing on my hair before I was happy with the curls</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still getting used to it, because I don&#x27;t use it every day, but so far, I love the ease and size of this curling iron.  </li>
            <li>but overall I am thrilled with this purchase.</li>
            <li>and this is a professional ceramic curling iron that they use in many salons</li>
            <li>By far my favorite curling iron if all time.</li>
            <li>I love how quickly it reaches high temperature &amp; stays there making the process much faster.</li>
            <li>This is my second one in five years, after my cat chewed the cord on the other one, and these curling irons are still the best on the market.</li>
            <li>When doing hair for a wedding party or just on myself the iron needs to heat evenly and be extremely hot in order to get quick even-heated curls.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, it is much easier to use and gives you much more control than a normal spring curling iron.</li>
            <li>which is the chance you take when your not careful, but I love them and these are what I got used to using in cosmetology school.</li>
            <li>It certainly gets very hot, ad a friend of mine swears by it.</li>
            <li>I saw a lot of reviews stating that it wasn&#x27;t easy to use and all because of the clamp that holds the hair, you can see clearly the type of handle and clamp</li>
            <li>I am a stylist and I have always had good luck with the hot tool irons I&#x27;ve been using them for 20 years for professional and personal use</li>
            <li>This curling iron works great, the curls last long, and is the right size.</li>
            <li>I have a 3/4 inch hot tools marcel curling iron</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t like to hold a curl, but this gets hot enough that it&#x27;ll stay for more than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>You set your temp, turn it on, and with in seconds your ready to curl!</li>
            <li>I have never tried this type of curling iron (the &amp;#34;Marcel&amp;#34;) and didn&#x27;t know what it would be like.</li>
            <li>I was slow at using it at first, but its a great product</li>
            <li>Curls look so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Not with the Hot Tools curling iron.</li>
            <li>I love to use it as a wand to get a different look.</li>
            <li>the first Hot Tools marcel that I bought from Amazon had a problem with the rotation mechanism in the handle.</li>
            <li>Overall I am pleased.</li>
            <li>, it needs something that gets HOT.</li>
            <li>Since I took it out of the box I can&#x27;t exactly return it</li>
            <li>It gives more beach waves rather than curls with the smaller size but it depends on what you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I burned my finger.  </li>
            <li>I feel the marcel iron produces better curls than the regular spring clamp irons.</li>
            <li>I find Hot Tools products very reliable.</li>
            <li>My hair glides very nicely with minimal catching because there are less &amp;#34;joints&amp;#34; than a traditional wand.</li>
            <li>I watched several tutorials but it was still not an easy use.</li>
            <li>and you still need the handle for certain styles</li>
            <li>I returned it and bought one from a local beauty supply store where they let me test the item before purchase and it worked fine.</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant to purchase the manual kind, since I&#x27;ve never used one before.</li>
            <li>It holds the curls very well</li>
            <li>really well!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very unwieldy to use.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re ready to go.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I came straight home and ordered this one from this seller.  </li>
            <li>I really like the versatility a marcel iron provides.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little trickier to use than a standard curling iron but it does an amazing job with curls!</li>
            <li>Good so far, have had problems  with this brand in the past.</li>
            <li>and I loved it, but my hair is getting pretty long now, so it&#x27;s too tight of a curl.</li>
            <li>Well, I like to have big full curls once in a while, yet most curing irons do not get hot enough, and just like with flat ironing my hair</li>
            <li>Gets very hot to help you curl your hair fast and help the curl last.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what a professional is looking for in a curling iron.</li>
            <li>Hot tools hold up to professional use.</li>
            <li>This curling iron is amazing at first and I have purchased several over the last 16 years but the last 5 (yes 5!)</li>
            <li>It took her a few tries to learn how to use, but her hair styles look great.</li>
            <li>so I need the high heat</li>
            <li>I go to a high end hair salon</li>
            <li>It has multiple heat settings for different hair types, which is great for making long lasting curls!</li>
            <li>The iron doesn&#x27;t have an automatic off, which is AMAZING because you constantly get an even temperature which cuts down on curling time</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stop playing with my new curling iron.</li>
            <li>If you want accidental burns and subsequent scars from the iron slipping and hitting your arms and shoulders, okay.</li>
            <li>It get hot enough for my hair</li>
            <li>I recommend this iron for professional use!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty simple to use once you get the hang of it and</li>
            <li>Hot Tools is my go to, replaced after my last iron lasted me 9 years!!</li>
            <li>Recently, a hair dresser used a hot tools marcel wand to curl my hair for a friend&#x27;s wedding</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a cosmetologist and this meets my expectations in every way, I&#x27;m super lucky to say the least.</li>
            <li>She brought one out, told me they were a &#x27;special buy&#x27; and there were only two left.  </li>
            <li>As curling irons go, it is a bit heavy, and a strong hand is needed.</li>
            <li>This iron has variable temp settings which I really needed since I have hard to curl and baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I use the professional iron, without the clamp.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a professional curling iron.</li>
            <li>This changed my hairstyling completely.  </li>
            <li>My wife wore an old one out and loves this one.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, so why would I need a curling iron?</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m a beginner, but my friend is a professional and is teaching me.  </li>
            <li>Never get buildup or crusties on the rod and has a heat control setting which is nice for delicate or coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>Not that easy to use, just enough long for short-medium hair, I would go back for XL type (no handle just a clip)</li>
            <li>It is just not easy or comfortable to handle at all.</li>
            <li>Just be aware that from continuous use of twirling the iron, the wire can get loose and you have to replace the iron.</li>
            <li>It heats up enough to hold the hair in place for a few hours, even for fine hair.</li>
            <li>This product heats up fast and can curl my long think hair in a matter of minutes!</li>
            <li>I usually get a good year, maybe18 months out of one of these but never more.  </li>
            <li>It is generally hot enough to curl my stubborn hair, but hot enough to burn my skin harshly if I accidentally allow it to slip.  </li>
            <li>But I find myself going back to my old straightener instead of taking the time to make it work the way I would like.</li>
            <li>I especially like the longer professional cord.</li>
            <li>First of all this thing gets hot, which is a good thing, until it burns the crap out of your face!</li>
            <li>she has several other tools made by hot tools and loves them.</li>
            <li>I feel like this curling iron really has some heat to it which some of my other curling irons were lacking.</li>
            <li>Worth the little extra it costs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little tricky to use at first</li>
            <li>The handle is a little loose and different from my old Hot Tools curling iron.  </li>

            <li> but heat is good.</li>
            <li> and I loved the way my stylist would curl my hair.  </li>
            <li> Good price and service</li>
            <li> Curls my hair perfectly and it is fantastic to use.</li>
            <li> but it still does a good job curling her ends.</li>
            <li> The curl is superior.  </li>

            <li> I think Hot Tools is the best brand of curling irons.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this iron for years, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing iron.</li>
            <li> but once u do it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this marcel curling iron.</li>
            <li> She wanted one for herself and was thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> , also nice that it has an adjustable heat setting.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Hot Tools 1 inch professional marcel curling iron, the price was perfect and the iron is the best.  </li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t hold curl worth anything, but with this iron, every day is a good hair day!</li>
            <li> Wish the cord was better but love everything else!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best curling iron I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> but honestly I prefer the option to be able to use the handle for tips of the hair</li>
            <li> This is by far the best curling iron I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Love love love this curling iron!</li>
            <li> It took me a while to get used to the handle on this curling iron and not being able to touch the tip, but once I was able to get the hang of it, I love it!</li>
            <li> This iron does a great job of creating the exact look</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great that I know how hot the curling iron is, so that I ensure that I don&#x27;t sizzle my hair.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better then the spring handle</li>
            <li> I love that you can set the temperature you want as well as release the handle to spin as you release the curl.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand of iron for many years.  </li>
            <li> With different heat settings its perfect for all hair types.</li>
            <li> Most curling irons have a tip at the end that one can hold onto.  </li>
            <li> My rating has to do more with ease of use than the quality, love the varying tempatures and the way my curls look.</li>
            <li> It gives you such perfect, voluminous curls.</li>
            <li> My favorite.....  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m am soooooo glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li> you will love them in all sizes</li>
            <li> It is better to use on others, but my hair stylist used it on me, and I fell in love with the curls.</li>
            <li> but once you do, its fantastic!</li>
            <li> Love this iron.  </li>
            <li> Perfect size for multiple styles.</li>
            <li> That may just take some more getting used to.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have it on the highest heat setting and it does a phenomenal job.</li>
            <li> I love the waves and body you achieve from a marcel iron.</li>
            <li> I purchased the 1&amp;#34; barrel - curls are bigger than I thought they&#x27;d be but the wavey/curly look is perfect for day-to-day wear.</li>
            <li> plus i love the marcel design</li>
            <li> Return was very easy and the seller was extremely nice and quick to reply.</li>
            <li> it worked great, it warms up quick and stays hot.</li>
            <li> Great professional tool</li>
            <li> I ordered the 1.5 inch and loved it so much I had to have the 1 inch.</li>
            <li> The lever does not have a spring and is on the opposite side of most curling irons--this takes some getting used too, but is great once you get used to it.</li>
            <li> it does not move  as easily.  </li>
            <li> But this is a professional tool, best left for hair stylists and not someone curling their own hair at home.</li>
            <li> I like the one I have now just fine.</li>
            <li> Love how hot it gets and love how comfortable it is in my hand.</li>
            <li> I am hair stylist so the marcel hot tools is perfect for me, if you are comfortable with that type of handle this iron is a classic favorite of stylist, now I have been tempted to get the no handle new style of iron</li>
            <li> I love hot tools!  </li>
            <li> IMPORTANT TIP:  </li>
            <li> Handle material is somewhat soft and provides a good grip for holding.  </li>
            <li> you enjoy as much as I am!!!</li>
            <li> This gets hot fast and makes gorgeous curls.</li>
            <li> I love the Hot Tools brand.</li>
            <li> There is nothing more embarrassing than holding your cord in a certain position trying to make the light stay on while finishing a client.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and gives you curls in just seconds, plus it&#x27;s so easy to use!  </li>
            <li> I returned this product immediately for a full refund.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought Hot Tools almost ever since becoming a Hairstylist 18 years ago.</li>
            <li> Nice professional iron.</li>
            <li> The sales price was full price, $40.  </li>
            <li> I cannot fathom anyone selling an item at full price and saying it is unreturnable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that it doesn&#x27;t have a cool touch tip on it either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a curling iron like this, it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li> and it is seriously the best curling iron I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several different ones before and this is the best.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many of these over the course of 5 years mainly cuz I misplace them</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and the temperature range fits any hair tpye.</li>
            <li> Also, if you hair doesn&#x27;t hold well, like mine, my stylist recommended Kendra 25 super hold finishing spray</li>
            <li> Gets VERY hot, but I don&#x27;t hear my hair cracking like it&#x27;s about to set on fire.</li>
            <li> I will always use Hot Tools!</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this curling wand!!</li>
            <li> Incredible hard to use.</li>
            <li> I learned pretty quickly - I&#x27;d say about an hour or less of watching youtube and practicing on my hair before I was happy with the curls</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still getting used to it, because I don&#x27;t use it every day, but so far, I love the ease and size of this curling iron.  </li>
            <li> but overall I am thrilled with this purchase.</li>
            <li> and this is a professional ceramic curling iron that they use in many salons</li>
            <li> By far my favorite curling iron if all time.</li>
            <li> I love how quickly it reaches high temperature &amp; stays there making the process much faster.</li>
            <li> This is my second one in five years, after my cat chewed the cord on the other one, and these curling irons are still the best on the market.</li>
            <li> When doing hair for a wedding party or just on myself the iron needs to heat evenly and be extremely hot in order to get quick even-heated curls.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, it is much easier to use and gives you much more control than a normal spring curling iron.</li>
            <li> which is the chance you take when your not careful, but I love them and these are what I got used to using in cosmetology school.</li>
            <li> It certainly gets very hot, ad a friend of mine swears by it.</li>
            <li> I saw a lot of reviews stating that it wasn&#x27;t easy to use and all because of the clamp that holds the hair, you can see clearly the type of handle and clamp</li>
            <li> I am a stylist and I have always had good luck with the hot tool irons I&#x27;ve been using them for 20 years for professional and personal use</li>
            <li> This curling iron works great, the curls last long, and is the right size.</li>
            <li> I have a 3/4 inch hot tools marcel curling iron</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t like to hold a curl, but this gets hot enough that it&#x27;ll stay for more than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> You set your temp, turn it on, and with in seconds your ready to curl!</li>
            <li> I have never tried this type of curling iron (the &amp;#34;Marcel&amp;#34;) and didn&#x27;t know what it would be like.</li>
            <li> I was slow at using it at first, but its a great product</li>
            <li> Curls look so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Not with the Hot Tools curling iron.</li>
            <li> I love to use it as a wand to get a different look.</li>
            <li> the first Hot Tools marcel that I bought from Amazon had a problem with the rotation mechanism in the handle.</li>
            <li> Overall I am pleased.</li>
            <li> , it needs something that gets HOT.</li>
            <li> Since I took it out of the box I can&#x27;t exactly return it</li>
            <li> It gives more beach waves rather than curls with the smaller size but it depends on what you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I burned my finger.  </li>
            <li> I feel the marcel iron produces better curls than the regular spring clamp irons.</li>
            <li> I find Hot Tools products very reliable.</li>
            <li> My hair glides very nicely with minimal catching because there are less &amp;#34;joints&amp;#34; than a traditional wand.</li>
            <li> I watched several tutorials but it was still not an easy use.</li>
            <li> and you still need the handle for certain styles</li>
            <li> I returned it and bought one from a local beauty supply store where they let me test the item before purchase and it worked fine.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to purchase the manual kind, since I&#x27;ve never used one before.</li>
            <li> It holds the curls very well</li>
            <li> really well!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very unwieldy to use.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re ready to go.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I came straight home and ordered this one from this seller.  </li>
            <li> I really like the versatility a marcel iron provides.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little trickier to use than a standard curling iron but it does an amazing job with curls!</li>
            <li> Good so far, have had problems  with this brand in the past.</li>
            <li> and I loved it, but my hair is getting pretty long now, so it&#x27;s too tight of a curl.</li>
            <li> Well, I like to have big full curls once in a while, yet most curing irons do not get hot enough, and just like with flat ironing my hair</li>
            <li> Gets very hot to help you curl your hair fast and help the curl last.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what a professional is looking for in a curling iron.</li>
            <li> Hot tools hold up to professional use.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is amazing at first and I have purchased several over the last 16 years but the last 5 (yes 5!)</li>
            <li> It took her a few tries to learn how to use, but her hair styles look great.</li>
            <li> so I need the high heat</li>
            <li> I go to a high end hair salon</li>
            <li> It has multiple heat settings for different hair types, which is great for making long lasting curls!</li>
            <li> The iron doesn&#x27;t have an automatic off, which is AMAZING because you constantly get an even temperature which cuts down on curling time</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop playing with my new curling iron.</li>
            <li> If you want accidental burns and subsequent scars from the iron slipping and hitting your arms and shoulders, okay.</li>
            <li> It get hot enough for my hair</li>
            <li> I recommend this iron for professional use!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty simple to use once you get the hang of it and</li>
            <li> Hot Tools is my go to, replaced after my last iron lasted me 9 years!!</li>
            <li> Recently, a hair dresser used a hot tools marcel wand to curl my hair for a friend&#x27;s wedding</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a cosmetologist and this meets my expectations in every way, I&#x27;m super lucky to say the least.</li>
            <li> She brought one out, told me they were a &#x27;special buy&#x27; and there were only two left.  </li>
            <li> As curling irons go, it is a bit heavy, and a strong hand is needed.</li>
            <li> This iron has variable temp settings which I really needed since I have hard to curl and baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I use the professional iron, without the clamp.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a professional curling iron.</li>
            <li> This changed my hairstyling completely.  </li>
            <li> My wife wore an old one out and loves this one.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, so why would I need a curling iron?</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a beginner, but my friend is a professional and is teaching me.  </li>
            <li> Never get buildup or crusties on the rod and has a heat control setting which is nice for delicate or coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> Not that easy to use, just enough long for short-medium hair, I would go back for XL type (no handle just a clip)</li>
            <li> It is just not easy or comfortable to handle at all.</li>
            <li> Just be aware that from continuous use of twirling the iron, the wire can get loose and you have to replace the iron.</li>
            <li> It heats up enough to hold the hair in place for a few hours, even for fine hair.</li>
            <li> This product heats up fast and can curl my long think hair in a matter of minutes!</li>
            <li> I usually get a good year, maybe18 months out of one of these but never more.  </li>
            <li> It is generally hot enough to curl my stubborn hair, but hot enough to burn my skin harshly if I accidentally allow it to slip.  </li>
            <li> But I find myself going back to my old straightener instead of taking the time to make it work the way I would like.</li>
            <li> I especially like the longer professional cord.</li>
            <li> First of all this thing gets hot, which is a good thing, until it burns the crap out of your face!</li>
            <li> she has several other tools made by hot tools and loves them.</li>
            <li> I feel like this curling iron really has some heat to it which some of my other curling irons were lacking.</li>
            <li> Worth the little extra it costs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little tricky to use at first</li>
            <li> The handle is a little loose and different from my old Hot Tools curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair that typically doesn&#x27;t hold a curl, but these curls last all day!</li>
            <li> This curling iron stays hot the entire time that you are using it and my hard to curl hair</li>
            <li> have gotten a short in the cord, some of them less than a couple months old.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to finally purchase one that works!</li>
            <li> It keeps it heat from curl to curl and has an extra long cord.</li>
            <li> Major regrets on this purchase!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I should have to go out every few months for a new one</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the lack of spring, but after a little bit of practice, I got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> BUT......it is the MOST awkward reverse clamp to use despite tutorials.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take too long before I became accustomed to the marcel handle</li>
            <li> You have to open it AND hold it closed.</li>
            <li> This is my second one of same model, last one lasted 6 years using it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have medium length thick straight hair and this iron does the job.</li>
            <li> Creates long lasting curls due to the hotter temp.</li>
            <li> I wish it simply had a clamp like other curling irons, why the user unfriendly handles???</li>
            <li> Keeps curls for a long time!</li>
            <li> It was a little tricky to figure out at first, but after a few times I have it down</li>
            <li> I thought that she would be less likely to burn herself than with a wand.</li>
            <li> If you place it on the highest heat setting, curling the entire hair takes less than 10 minutes and the curls stay all day.</li>
            <li> It took a little getting used to since there is no spring, but once you get the hang of it, you will never go back!</li>
            <li> I definitely prefer the marcel over a spring curler hands down!</li>
            <li> It arrived as promised and is what I expected.</li>
            <li> Just be careful when handling because it doesn&#x27;t have a heat guard on the rounded tip.</li>
            <li> Definitely takes a few minutes to get the hang of the spinning handles.</li>
            <li> I thing a glove or at least 2 finger cots should be in the package for what it costs, but other than that, no complaints so far.</li>
            <li> I have tendinitis in my hand which makes grasping this handle which opens WAY out of the range a thumb or other digit can grasp it other than the way it is shown in the tutorials and strains my wrist.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing to hold the other end, just the iron itself.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it seems to work well.</li>
            <li> My hair stays in place all day long, but can still move with me and isn&#x27;t stiff or sticky looking.</li>
            <li> I purchased another one larger barrel and seems to be working fine, just very disappointed only worked for 6 months or less.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that the marking showing the temperatures is still hard to read.</li>
            <li> They were very prompt in their response and informed me they were sorry but did not have the size I was looking for and that I could just return it.</li>
            <li> (you don&#x27;t have to wait on it to reheat like most)and cuts down on \\&quot;frizzy curls.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the cords always end up melting on other rods or showing wires which eventually short right up by where the cord attaches to the base.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not have the spring in the handle which I appreciate, but when someone that is not used to this type of curling iron tries to use it, they usually burn themselves trying to hold the end.</li>
            <li> I never really curled my hair before because in the past it has never lasted and took forever to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the marcel iron, so I&#x27;ve found it somewhat difficult to use.</li>
            <li> It is a little trickier, but I like the result it produces</li>
            <li> if you are not familiar with this product then just buy one from walmart or kmart.</li>
            <li> and I almost don&#x27;t want to share with them my hot little secret!!</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to</li>
            <li> and you can sleep with them in wake up and do a little touch up</li>
            <li> Just takes a little practice to get used to.</li>
            <li> It does take a little bit to get use to</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few of these irons (used to be a licensed cosmetologist).  </li>
            <li> I accidently bought the professional tool and I was physically unable to use it.  </li>
            <li> I literally have a penny round burn mark on my face.</li>
            <li> I had to watch a few you tube videos because the packaging did not come with instructions.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t curl my hair everyday</li>
            <li> Burned my fingers badly the first time I tried to use it.  </li>
            <li> This one is really loose and is just very hard to work.</li>
            <li> It is extremely hard to use and has no cool tip.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!</li>
            <li> Despite using the iron everyday, at the highest temperature setting, I have yet to experience any \\&quot;fried ends\\&quot;!&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li> They work well and usually hold up for years.  </li>
            <li> this is not an ordinary curling iron.</li>
            <li> and she said she had tried them in the past and never could get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> It went in the trash this morning as we were past the return date.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> The wife likes it and she hasn&#x27;t complained to me about it, so</li>

            <li> Shopping online for a new brand :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was put in the description of this curling iron, but this is very hard to work with.  </li>
            <li> I unfortunately ordered the wrong barrel size and this was the same size she already owned.</li>
            <li> Seems like it is broken, but hard to tell.</li>
            <li> I had hoped it would be a little easier, but still find the mechanism somewhat awkward.</li>
            <li> This product is DANGEROUS as it heats to extreme temps and is way too difficult to handle!</li>
            <li> Not to mention it is very hard to use!</li>
            <li> My hair is temperamental and sometimes difficult to style.</li>
            <li> I think it was just random defect.</li>
            <li> The iron heats up well, but unless you are used to using this type of iron, it may be difficult.  </li>
            <li> it was to complicated with the handle turning so</li>
            <li> It seems very awkward to use, probably my fault as I am not good with hair.  </li>
            <li> The handle is awkward and there is no holding spring, so when it slips, it burns your skin.</li>

            <li> best curling iron out there!!! Just be aware that from continuous use of twirling the iron, the wire can get loose and you have to replace the iron. It&#x27;s a great price though and they will work with you if that were to happen shortly after purchasing them. They should hold up for a while. It holds the curls very well</li>
            <li> The handle is a little loose and different from my old Hot Tools curling iron.  It is a little trickier, but I like the result it produces</li>
            <li> Love it ! If you have hair that never holds curls well this is the one for you✔️</li>
            <li> Wonderful curling iron. Creates long lasting curls due to the hotter temp. control. Bought as a Christmas gift for my daughter &amp; my daughter-in-law. Both absolutely love using it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little trickier to use than a standard curling iron but it does an amazing job with curls! Love this!</li>
            <li> Horrible curling iron. Its very awkward to use, not your clamp and curl iron everyone is used to.  I returned this product immediately for a full refund.  If I could I would give zero stars!  DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!</li>
            <li> I have a 3/4 inch hot tools marcel curling iron and I loved it, but my hair is getting pretty long now, so it&#x27;s too tight of a curl. I ordered this one and it&#x27;s perfect, just what I was expecting. My hair doesn&#x27;t like to hold a curl, but this gets hot enough that it&#x27;ll stay for more than 10 minutes. Love it. Very happy.</li>
            <li> It arrived as promised and is what I expected.</li>
            <li> Works well. This is the best curling tool I have. I have tried several different ones before and this is the best.</li>
            <li> Stylist used it so I bought. Works great</li>
            <li> Great curling iron love the marcel handle .  It&#x27;s better then the spring handle</li>
            <li> Favorite curling iron ever!</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron! My hair is temperamental and sometimes difficult to style. This iron does a great job of creating the exact look I want that lasts throughout the day. The lever does not have a spring and is on the opposite side of most curling irons--this takes some getting used too, but is great once you get used to it. I love that you can set the temperature you want as well as release the handle to spin as you release the curl. The iron doesn&#x27;t have an automatic off, which is AMAZING because you constantly get an even temperature which cuts down on curling time (you don&#x27;t have to wait on it to reheat like most)and cuts down on \\&quot;frizzy curls.\\&quot; Despite using the iron everyday, at the highest temperature setting, I have yet to experience any \\&quot;fried ends\\&quot;!&lt;br /&gt;Hope you enjoy as much as I am!!!</li>
            <li> The handle took some getting used too, but once I got the hang of it - I found it to be easier to use actually. Gets VERY hot, but I don&#x27;t hear my hair cracking like it&#x27;s about to set on fire. Love this curling iron!!</li>
            <li> Love love love this curling iron! I don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to finally purchase one that works!</li>
            <li> I have used this brand of iron for many years.  I use the professional iron, without the clamp.  It is generally hot enough to curl my stubborn hair, but hot enough to burn my skin harshly if I accidentally allow it to slip.  As curling irons go, it is a bit heavy, and a strong hand is needed.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Hot Tools 1 inch professional marcel curling iron, the price was perfect and the iron is the best.  What a great find.</li>
            <li> Really enjoying this iron! With different heat settings its perfect for all hair types. You set your temp, turn it on, and with in seconds your ready to curl! Curls last all day. I have medium length thick straight hair and this iron does the job. It keeps it heat from curl to curl and has an extra long cord. I do suggest if you have not used this type before to practice rolling it with it off until you get the hang of it. Very different from spring loaded ones and you will get a nasty burn if you dont know how to use it. But once you master it you will love it and never purchase a spring loaded one again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a cosmetologist and this meets my expectations in every way, I&#x27;m super lucky to say the least.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!! have multiple sizes and have used them for about 15 years now .... It&#x27;s a professional curling iron. You definitely have to know how to use it and practice with it. Created for professionals. This is exactly what a professional is looking for in a curling iron. When doing hair for a wedding party or just on myself the iron needs to heat evenly and be extremely hot in order to get quick even-heated curls. Should not be given to KIDS!! .... if you are not familiar with this product then just buy one from walmart or kmart.</li>
            <li> The wife likes it and she hasn&#x27;t complained to me about it, so I say it&#x27;s a winner.</li>
            <li> If you want accidental burns and subsequent scars from the iron slipping and hitting your arms and shoulders, okay. But this is a professional tool, best left for hair stylists and not someone curling their own hair at home. The handle is awkward and there is no holding spring, so when it slips, it burns your skin.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and wavy so I need the high heat and this has it! A marcel iron takes some practice because there is no spring where it clips onto your hair. You control the pressure and release, etc.  Just be careful when handling because it doesn&#x27;t have a heat guard on the rounded tip.</li>
            <li> I used this for my trip and it did the job.  For touch up when you are in a hurry.  The heating setting are perfect.  It get hot enough for my hair and I require a lot of heat.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a gift for my girlfriend, whose a stylist, for Christmas. The product is great she has several other tools made by hot tools and loves them. I unfortunately ordered the wrong barrel size and this was the same size she already owned. The seller was awesome about it. I informed them that I didn&#x27;t want to take the sale from them because of my mistake and asked them if they had the size I was looking for and that I would just exchange it. They were very prompt in their response and informed me they were sorry but did not have the size I was looking for and that I could just return it. Return was very easy and the seller was extremely nice and quick to reply.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and gives you curls in just seconds, plus it&#x27;s so easy to use!  Love it!  Also, retail price is $55.</li>
            <li> IMPORTANT TIP:  Most curling irons have a tip at the end that one can hold onto.  THIS DOESN&#x27;T!!  There are gloves one can buy to use with these Marcel types of curling irons so one doesn&#x27;t burn the tips of the fingers. I&#x27;m still getting used to it, because I don&#x27;t use it every day, but so far, I love the ease and size of this curling iron.  I thing a glove or at least 2 finger cots should be in the package for what it costs, but other than that, no complaints so far.</li>
            <li> I prefer marcel irons over traditional clamp irons. I&#x27;ve bought Hot Tools almost ever since becoming a Hairstylist 18 years ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few of these irons (used to be a licensed cosmetologist).  They work well and usually hold up for years.  I&#x27;m expecting the same from this one.</li>
            <li> Why did I not get this sooner??!!  This changed my hairstyling completely.  It didn&#x27;t take too long before I became accustomed to the marcel handle and I love it!  It&#x27;s also great that I know how hot the curling iron is, so that I ensure that I don&#x27;t sizzle my hair.  Love this curling iron!</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron! It does have a learning curve to understand how the handle works as it twists but overall I am thrilled with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Works well and all but has no plastic tip and the part that is suppose to keep your hair in place on the rod doesn&#x27;t have a spring. You have to open it AND hold it closed. Definitely takes some getting used to if you haven&#x27;t used this type of iron before. My rating has to do more with ease of use than the quality, love the varying tempatures and the way my curls look.</li>
            <li> This product heats up fast and can curl my long think hair in a matter of minutes! Once you get used to the spinning mechanism of the Marcel iron there&#x27;s no going back. It&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best curling iron I have ever owned. It gives you such perfect, voluminous curls. In my opinion, it is much easier to use and gives you much more control than a normal spring curling iron. It has multiple heat settings for different hair types, which is great for making long lasting curls! I can&#x27;t stop playing with my new curling iron.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron!! It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Nice professional iron. The ability to control the temperature is a must for pro use and this one delivers. I recommend this iron for professional use!</li>
            <li> My favorite.....  Love how hot it gets and love how comfortable it is in my hand.</li>
            <li> It seems very awkward to use, probably my fault as I am not good with hair.  It certainly gets very hot, ad a friend of mine swears by it.</li>
            <li> I have always used a traditional curling iron with the spring in the handle, but they always end up wearing out and loosing their holding power.I was a little hesitant to purchase the manual kind, since I&#x27;ve never used one before. I&#x27;m am soooooo glad I purchased this. It&#x27;s pretty simple to use once you get the hang of it and the curls are a-ma-zing! I have very fine, thin hair that typically doesn&#x27;t hold a curl, but these curls last all day! If you&#x27;re on the fence, buy it! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of the handle it works so nice!</li>
            <li> Not that easy to use, just enough long for short-medium hair, I would go back for XL type (no handle just a clip) but heat is good.</li>
            <li> This curling iron lasted about 5 minutes, before it stopped heating up.  I will not recommend this product or company to anyone.</li>
            <li> It was a little tricky to figure out at first, but after a few times I have it down and it is seriously the best curling iron I have ever owned.  After I curl my hair I brush through it and the curls last for days.  People are constantly complementing me on my hair and I almost don&#x27;t want to share with them my hot little secret!! I go to a high end hair salon and I loved the way my stylist would curl my hair.  I googled for curling irons that looked like the one he was using (thinking I would be spending hundreds), and finally found the match. The price is awesome and the curling iron is amazing!</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron! It&#x27;s a little tricky to use at first but there are YouTube tutorials on how to use a marcel iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a curling iron like this, it&#x27;s not bad but I&#x27;m a bit uncoordinated and clumsy so I can&#x27;t seem to use it well. I&#x27;m still trying!</li>
            <li> This iron has variable temp settings which I really needed since I have hard to curl and baby fine hair.  Handle material is somewhat soft and provides a good grip for holding.  I will always use Hot Tools!</li>
            <li> I am a stylist and I have always had good luck with the hot tool irons I&#x27;ve been using them for 20 years for professional and personal use you will love them in all sizes</li>
            <li> It curls, the heat settings are great BUT......it is the MOST awkward reverse clamp to use despite tutorials. I have tendinitis in my hand which makes grasping this handle which opens WAY out of the range a thumb or other digit can grasp it other than the way it is shown in the tutorials and strains my wrist. I have burnt myself numerous times. I wish it simply had a clamp like other curling irons, why the user unfriendly handles??? I wish I didn&#x27;t buy this. I will purchase something else with a selection of heat settings.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed. I have never tried this type of curling iron (the &amp;#34;Marcel&amp;#34;) and didn&#x27;t know what it would be like. It is just not easy or comfortable to handle at all. Apart from the awkwardness of that handle, it does curl well.</li>
            <li> Best curling iron ever, I love it. My curls hold really well!&lt;br /&gt;It does not have the spring in the handle which I appreciate, but when someone that is not used to this type of curling iron tries to use it, they usually burn themselves trying to hold the end.</li>
            <li> Hot Tools is my go to, replaced after my last iron lasted me 9 years!!</li>
            <li> Good so far, have had problems  with this brand in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this iron for years, it&#x27;s amazing. Advice for beginners with the Marcel style irons, watch tutorials or see if someone can show you how to use it. Or just stick to regular spring irons. Also, I&#x27;m a bag fan of holding the iron shut and wrapping my hair around it for the big curls! Love this iron! !!!!</li>
            <li> It takes a lot of dexterity to use on yourself. It is better to use on others, but my hair stylist used it on me, and I fell in love with the curls. Great product once you get used to it!</li>
            <li> Caution to all...this is not an ordinary curling iron. It is extremely hard to use and has no cool tip. Burned my fingers badly the first time I tried to use it.  Just could not get the hang of it without it having the &#x27;spring handle&#x27;. I even asked my hairdresser about them and she said she had tried them in the past and never could get the hang of it. Ended up giving it away because I had already thrown out the packaging.</li>
            <li> My wife wore an old one out and loves this one.</li>
            <li> This product is DANGEROUS as it heats to extreme temps and is way too difficult to handle! Yesterday I burned my face accidentally when the end slipped out of my hand. It went in the trash this morning as we were past the return date. Major regrets on this purchase!</li>
            <li> Hot tools hold up to professional use. Good price and service</li>
            <li> I am hair stylist so the marcel hot tools is perfect for me, if you are comfortable with that type of handle this iron is a classic favorite of stylist, now I have been tempted to get the no handle new style of iron but honestly I prefer the option to be able to use the handle for tips of the hair, it makes sense and without the handle you need to get a glove for heat, who needs 2 parts of an iron when there is no time to look for gloves, put them on and you still need the handle for certain styles but with enough skill you can avoid denting the hair.</li>
            <li> How in the world does anyone use this thing without burning themselves!  Ouch!</li>
            <li> Curls my hair perfectly and it is fantastic to use. I was slow at using it at first, but its a great product</li>
            <li> Works great fianc&amp;eacute; looks beautiful with her hair curled.</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron! It takes a little getting used to but once you do, its fantastic!</li>
            <li> Very unwieldy to use.  Seems like it is broken, but hard to tell. I accidentally ripped the box opening it and so can&#x27;t return it.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter who is a teen. I thought that she would be less likely to burn herself than with a wand. She figured it out with the aid of some YouTube demos. I wish that i had ordered a slightly smaller barrel but it still does a good job curling her ends.</li>
            <li> I accidently bought the professional tool and I was physically unable to use it.  I had to sent it back.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many of these over the course of 5 years mainly cuz I misplace them and I have a habit of wrapping the cord around the iron and it shorts out which is the chance you take when your not careful, but I love them and these are what I got used to using in cosmetology school. I saw a lot of reviews stating that it wasn&#x27;t easy to use and all because of the clamp that holds the hair, you can see clearly the type of handle and clamp it has before you order it and this is a professional ceramic curling iron that they use in many salons so sometimes it does take some time to get the hang out it. But the curls last all day and you can sleep with them in wake up and do a little touch up and you&#x27;re ready to go.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite curling iron if all time. It heats up quickly and the temperature range fits any hair tpye. If you place it on the highest heat setting, curling the entire hair takes less than 10 minutes and the curls stay all day. This is a must have for every woman.</li>
            <li> Thr handles were a  bakelight finish ,Like that of a phone .When turning  it does not move  as easily.  .Also the temperature could  be hotter. Product arrived on time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this marcel curling iron. Definitely takes a few minutes to get the hang of the spinning handles. I love how quickly it reaches high temperature &amp; stays there making the process much faster. Curls look so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> First of all this thing gets hot, which is a good thing, until it burns the crap out of your face! I literally have a penny round burn mark on my face. There&#x27;s nothing to hold the other end, just the iron itself. Not to mention it is very hard to use! It&#x27;s not like your regular curling iron clamp. This one is really loose and is just very hard to work. I ended up giving it away.</li>
            <li> I tried shopping locally for this item for my daughter in-law for Christmas.  Sally Hassen had two in stock in the back room.  She brought one out, told me they were a &#x27;special buy&#x27; and there were only two left.  Hhowever, she also said that since there were only two left, that the purchase would be unrefundable.  The sales price was full price, $40.  I explained to her that if it were on clearance, say 75% off, then I would risk her no refund policy.  I cannot fathom anyone selling an item at full price and saying it is unreturnable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came straight home and ordered this one from this seller.  Thank you, great product!</li>
            <li> It took me a while to get used to the handle on this curling iron and not being able to touch the tip, but once I was able to get the hang of it, I love it! I feel like this curling iron really has some heat to it which some of my other curling irons were lacking. After about 4 or 5 curls, I&#x27;d have to hold the curling iron in my hair what seemed like forever to get it to curl. Not with the Hot Tools curling iron. This curling iron stays hot the entire time that you are using it and my hard to curl hair always looks great.</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron! Keeps curls for a long time! Definitely always buying Marcel in the future!</li>
            <li> I love hot tools!  These curling irons are all I use in the salon and hold their heat well.  The curl is superior.  Never get buildup or crusties on the rod and has a heat control setting which is nice for delicate or coarse hair.  Marcel is perfect.  My only complaint is that the cords always end up melting on other rods or showing wires which eventually short right up by where the cord attaches to the base.  I usually get a good year, maybe18 months out of one of these but never more.  Keep in mind I use it repeatedly almost daily though.  Wish the cord was better but love everything else!</li>
            <li> Great professional tool</li>
            <li> This was a birthday for our daughter...she loves it!  It took her a few tries to learn how to use, but her hair styles look great.</li>
            <li> Love this iron.  Gets very hot to help you curl your hair fast and help the curl last.  Perfect size for multiple styles.</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron! There is a learning curve in perfecting your curls, but once you learn it&#x27;s great! I love to use it as a wand to get a different look.</li>
            <li> Did not hold a curl at all. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is my second one in five years, after my cat chewed the cord on the other one, and these curling irons are still the best on the market. Love it!!</li>
            <li> the first Hot Tools marcel that I bought from Amazon had a problem with the rotation mechanism in the handle. I returned it and bought one from a local beauty supply store where they let me test the item before purchase and it worked fine. I think it was just random defect. I like the one I have now just fine.</li>
            <li> I had a iron like this one that I had and used for years. I am happy for one improvement. The cord&#x27;s lighter weight makes it easier to handle. The only problem is that the marking showing the temperatures is still hard to read. Using trail and error could cause you to burn your hair. Overall I am pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the marcel iron, so I&#x27;ve found it somewhat difficult to use. I had hoped it would be a little easier, but still find the mechanism somewhat awkward. That may just take some more getting used to. Other than that, it seems to work well. It heats up enough to hold the hair in place for a few hours, even for fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, so why would I need a curling iron? Well, I like to have big full curls once in a while, yet most curing irons do not get hot enough, and just like with flat ironing my hair, it needs something that gets HOT. This curling iron works great, the curls last long, and is the right size.</li>
            <li> This is my second one of same model, last one lasted 6 years using it everyday. Worth the little extra it costs.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best curling iron I have ever used! My hair doesn&#x27;t hold curl worth anything, but with this iron, every day is a good hair day! It took a little getting used to since there is no spring, but once you get the hang of it, you will never go back! I don&#x27;t even have it on the highest heat setting and it does a phenomenal job. Also, if you hair doesn&#x27;t hold well, like mine, my stylist recommended Kendra 25 super hold finishing spray and it is awesome! My hair stays in place all day long, but can still move with me and isn&#x27;t stiff or sticky looking. All around great product and a fantastic price!</li>
            <li> Works great! Just takes a little practice to get used to.</li>
            <li> I really like the versatility a marcel iron provides. This gets hot fast and makes gorgeous curls. I have found out of all the sizes of barrels, the 1 inch makes the prettiest of the desired curls for all hair lengths longer than 2 inches.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was put in the description of this curling iron, but this is very hard to work with.  There isn&#x27;t a clamp to hold your hair, you have to somehow hold/maneuver the lever/clamp manually.  I haven&#x27;t even attempted to try this one because I know I will burn myself with it.  Since I took it out of the box I can&#x27;t exactly return it so I think I will pry the clamp off and give it to my daughter to use it as a wand (?)</li>
            <li> Amazing iron. I love the waves and body you achieve from a marcel iron.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift for one if my coworkers n she loves the curls that it gives to here clients.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is amazing at first and I have purchased several over the last 16 years but the last 5 (yes 5!) have gotten a short in the cord, some of them less than a couple months old. There is nothing more embarrassing than holding your cord in a certain position trying to make the light stay on while finishing a client. I don&#x27;t think I should have to go out every few months for a new one but it is the only marcel I can get locally in a hurry.  Something has to change. Shopping online for a new brand :(</li>
            <li> Incredible hard to use. I watched several tutorials but it was still not an easy use.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this curling wand!! It gives more beach waves rather than curls with the smaller size but it depends on what you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful, it leaves rad burns if the iron gets in contact with skin directly. I have to burn scars on my thigh from prom. :/</li>
            <li> This item stopped working about 6months after I received it.  I purchased another one larger barrel and seems to be working fine, just very disappointed only worked for 6 months or less.</li>
            <li> Takes some getting use to, not for beginners and I&#x27;m a beginner, but my friend is a professional and is teaching me.  The first time I used it, I burned my finger.  Haven&#x27;t done that since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a ton of videos on how to use this tool.</li>
            <li> I am unsure of how to work this properly.  It is not intuitive.  It tells you in the directions that it takes awhile to get used to.  But I find myself going back to my old straightener instead of taking the time to make it work the way I would like.</li>
            <li> I think Hot Tools is the best brand of curling irons. I did not have any experience with marcel irons prior to this purchase. It took about 2-3 times before getting the hang of it. I had to watch a few you tube videos because the packaging did not come with instructions. I feel the marcel iron produces better curls than the regular spring clamp irons. I will purchase another marcel iron in another size.</li>
            <li> The iron heats up well, but unless you are used to using this type of iron, it may be difficult.  I probably could get used to it but I don&#x27;t curl my hair everyday so I probably don&#x27;t use it enough to do that.  I don&#x27;t like that it doesn&#x27;t have a cool touch tip on it either.</li>
            <li> I never really curled my hair before because in the past it has never lasted and took forever to do. Recently, a hair dresser used a hot tools marcel wand to curl my hair for a friend&#x27;s wedding and I loved the way it turned out and my hair lasted all night! I purchased the 1&amp;#34; barrel - curls are bigger than I thought they&#x27;d be but the wavey/curly look is perfect for day-to-day wear. My hair glides very nicely with minimal catching because there are less &amp;#34;joints&amp;#34; than a traditional wand. I learned pretty quickly - I&#x27;d say about an hour or less of watching youtube and practicing on my hair before I was happy with the curls but I didn&#x27;t have to break any habits of a traditional curling iron. I definitely prefer the marcel over a spring curler hands down!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter.  She discovered this iron when it was used by her hair stylist. She wanted one for herself and was thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> this is a great iron, i work in a spa and just had prom up-dos, it worked great, it warms up quick and stays hot. plus i love the marcel design, also nice that it has an adjustable heat setting. my advice: buy it!</li>
            <li> I ordered the 1.5 inch and loved it so much I had to have the 1 inch. It does take a little bit to get use to but once u do it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me it was to complicated with the handle turning so, I gave it to my daughter</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the lack of spring, but after a little bit of practice, I got the hang of it. It&#x27;s a wonderful curling iron. My stylist recommended it for me. I love the Hot Tools brand.</li>
            <li> I find Hot Tools products very reliable. I especially like the longer professional cord. I replaced the one I had after only 16 months. The cord wiring went bad inside the swivel piece. I wish there were a way to replace just the cord.</li>
