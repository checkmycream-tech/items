            <li>so I feel good about using it on my baby too if she ever needs it in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The soap feels good on the area where I have the fungus.  </li>
            <li>But it is a good addition to my shower routine to help rid myself of fungus, acne, and bacteria.</li>
            <li>I teach 6th grade, so I&#x27;m on my feet a good part of the day.</li>
            <li>After doing some research, I read that tea tree oil is really good for the skin.  </li>
            <li>Really good</li>
            <li>but maybe it is a good thing?</li>

            <li>After doing some research, I read that tea tree oil is really good for the skin.</li>
            <li>the smell is great, the product not too medicinal smelly or girly, just a nice balanced soap that helps with the swamp feet / funky odors coming from my feet and sneakers.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t burn, felt good, smelt good.</li>
            <li>Good, prompt service.</li>

            <li>This product does what it says it does, and we were very pleased not to smell like we had been sheep-dipped.  </li>
            <li>He hates most moisturizers because they leave his feet feeling greasy, so to say this has been a welcome change would be an understatement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very refreshing and cures jock itch and athletes feet.</li>

            <li>This stuff is amazing and I will recommend it to anyone with skin issues.</li>
            <li>Received reply with lots of words but without answer, except to say that I can add my own tea tree oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really liked this.</li>
            <li>Nice quality product-</li>
            <li>If it is killing what it needs to kill perhaps there are bound to be some kind of a reaction.</li>
            <li>Nice peppermint smell</li>
            <li>He liked the way his skin felt and noticed a difference with his feet.  </li>
            <li>However, I can&#x27;t recommend it based on my own experience.</li>
            <li>It shipped fast, came in great packaging, and the bottle is a great size.</li>
            <li>It does smell really nice thoe.</li>
            <li>Customer service is excellent, and it feels good to use a natural product with visible benefits.  </li>
            <li>It does seem to help reduce itching and a nice minty smell.  </li>
            <li>I like it, and it smells nice.</li>
            <li>This product really helped me out after applying the Antifungal Soap and Body Wash to both my feet while I was in the shower and within days the fungus that was visible was no longer a problem so it happened to work out perfectly</li>
            <li>They take care of their customers which is nice to see these days.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use a pouf sponge and scrub good and a water filter for your shower wouldn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>Leaves you feeling very clean!</li>
            <li>, feels great and makes my feet feel tingly and fresh!</li>

            <li>The tea tree oil and peppermint smells great, and my son says that he feels clean and confident after using it.</li>
            <li>I really love how effective this product is.</li>
            <li>but this is by far the best!</li>
            <li>The soap itself has a nice tea tree oil scent that is not at all overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Refreshing body wash that lathers nicely</li>
            <li>Cycling is great exercise and lots of fun.</li>
            <li>When I first purchased this, I received an excellent email from the seller with detailed information about the ingredients and tips for use.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this product , so pleased that I ordered 2 more.</li>
            <li>The feel and smell is very soothing &amp; pepperminty &amp; a good price!</li>
            <li>Good product and worth the money!</li>
            <li>This is very good to the skin leaves it nice and soft.</li>
            <li>It smells great and is a great body wash overall!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many of the cheaper salicylic acid body washes and this has been the most effective.</li>
            <li>The body wash gave me a clean and confident feeling, and I highly recommend this product to anyone with any kind of fungal infection, or if you just want to smell great!</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was the great tea tree oil and the peppermint smell of the body wash.</li>

            <li>Funga-Free goes on smoothly &amp; absorbs quickly, and it smells VERY nice.  </li>
            <li>Relieves my itchy legs, which is huge relief!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although, this one is WAY better than Bronner&#x27;s magic tea tree soap.</li>
            <li>In fact, I already ordered a back-up bottle :)</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for a great product...</li>
            <li>I wish I knew about this soap before as I have tried many kinds before</li>
            <li>stopped itching for the most part.</li>
            <li>I wear low-heeled slip-on shoes most of the time, most of the time with no hosiery.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased and reviewed many products with tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>glad that I did.</li>
            <li>Feels and smells refreshing and soothing.</li>
            <li>Better than soap.</li>
            <li>The tea tree oil and mint are so refreshing.</li>
            <li>and it gives a refreshing and almost tingling feeling when used (which i&#x27;m assuming is from the tea tree oil).</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be gone in no time.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>so I guess use it at night before bed and if it doesn&#x27;t create a problem for you, then it is safe to use in the morning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with the rate of progress, and with this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already ordered more.</li>
            <li>but I have not had time to be sure.</li>
            <li>And I am sure its better for my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s feels refreshing and rejuvenating.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs into the skin well, and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feel like most retail</li>
            <li>Totally satisfied.</li>
            <li>We have skin problems (dis-coloration, itchiness)  and this product is safe.</li>
            <li>Bottom line, I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I am quite satisfied with the ​Funga-Free body wash.</li>
            <li>gave it one more star because it seems indeed prevent some foot stinky.</li>
            <li>Works well, it would be better if it lathered a bit more.</li>
            <li>soothing and love the smell...</li>
            <li>The tea tree oil and mint are so refreshing.</li>
            <li>I have had a rash on my calves for quite some time now and haven&#x27;t been sure what it is.</li>
            <li>And I will update as more moths goes by.</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my skin look and feel without drying it out.</li>
            <li>Softball season is just around the corner for me, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll have plenty of opportunities to use it then</li>
            <li>We wanted something that smelled okay without smelling girlie and did a better job of stopping the itching.</li>
            <li>I have ordered from Amazon different Antifungal Soap products and this one is the best.</li>
            <li>This product helps to keep my mild/moderate seborrheic dermatitis under control as well leaving my skin feeling moisturised - all this and lovely scent.</li>
            <li>Helga always gets in-contact to make sure you are satisfied.</li>

            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I thought this would be better.</li>
            <li>Going to use it for another week to be sure the rash is gone</li>
            <li>Dries out my skin a tiny bit, but all things considered, it was a good buy!!!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more happier with this product.</li>
            <li>Safe for all ages in my opinion.</li>
            <li>What I love most about this product is how versatile it</li>
            <li>I love to wear shoes without socks.  </li>
            <li>Great product-it&#x27;s really helping me</li>
            <li>Funga-Free seems to do a much better job than those products that I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li>Bought 2 bottles to be on the safe side but</li>
            <li>My husband and I love to bicycle for miles.</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t many companies these days that seem so determined to please their customers.  </li>
            <li>I just started to use this &amp; again I am satisfied with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started using this product recently - so far so good!</li>
            <li>So far so good - bought this for my mother and she has found it very refreshing.</li>
            <li>It feels great and smells wonderful and really helps my feet stay moisturized so they dont dry out.  </li>
            <li>Nice clean scent</li>
            <li>My skin cracks easily and this product has helped more than anything that I have ever used (even better than prescription products).</li>
            <li>I do feel very clean after using it.</li>
            <li>Works like a charm - first, it&#x27;s a good soap.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive this product in the mail!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a new happy believer of Funga-free body wash.</li>
            <li>and you get squeaky clean!</li>
            <li>They just felt clean!</li>
            <li>While it hasn&#x27;t been effective for that, I liked how it gives me a good lather without dehydrating my skin and leaving it dry.</li>
            <li>Very good quality anti-fungal soap.. Definitely is in my daily regimine to help with summer heat exacerbation.</li>
            <li>happy I took the chance and purchased the Antifungal soap with natural Tea Tree oil.</li>
            <li>Great body wash, leaves the skin moisturized and soft.  </li>
            <li>Great so far.</li>
            <li>So far, this is working great.</li>
            <li>Great product, it&#x27;s aost orgasmic to use since it really is a natural product…I would recommend this product to a friend who&#x27;s having problems with fungus or foot problems…</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s really fair to know how much is in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a nice fresh smell.  </li>
            <li>; - I&#x27;m a stickler for needing to feel squeaky clean after my shower - and in my opinion, it does indeed leave a clean, refreshed, nicely rinsed feeling.</li>

            <li>and so far it&#x27;s been amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found something that does what it says, it ships fast and the follow up from</li>
            <li>We use it daily and is also good for shampoo.</li>

            <li>It leaves skin feeling cool and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Update review - so far no change getting kind of discouraged.</li>
            <li>Third, my hands were tingling (in a good way).</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it for long, but it seems to be fairly effective!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been dealing with my skin condition for some time now and tried many things and nothing ever really worked.</li>
            <li>Smells really good the entire day</li>
            <li>So far so good from someone who is constantly battling a fungus issue of some kind.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We also like the clean, pleasant scent, and as other reviewers have said, it makes for a fantastic deodorizer.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that it creates itching in certain areas (LOL)</li>
            <li>Fresh clean scent of mint.</li>
            <li>Leaves you with a fresh, crash clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I feel clean and fresh always.</li>
            <li>Mild scent and</li>
            <li>Additionally, the seller took the time to personally follow up with me and make sure I was satisfied with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>The fact that it is all natural is a bonus and makes me more comfortable using the product.  </li>
            <li>and it has definitely made his skin feel much more comfortable !</li>
            <li>Works well and quickly for itch and blistering reduction.</li>
            <li>Also,  I am pregnant</li>
            <li>I can happily say that the rash has diminished quite a bit visibly and definitely doesn&#x27;t itch as much as it used to after using the body wash for about a week now.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve seen improvements quickly.</li>
            <li>It has the clean, crisp scent of peppermint that leaves you feeling smooth, fresh and energized.</li>
            <li>It has been very hot and humid here</li>
            <li>This soap works great in calming down irritants.</li>
            <li>Unlike some other similar products, this has a nice, light, pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>My feet is relieved of dry itchy skin and makes my feet feel good.</li>
            <li>Definitely ordering more!</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s wonderful that this product is all natural, so it really does help with dry skin and itchiness.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try a product that I could use everyday but also safe and effective.</li>
            <li>the overall product is nice quality.</li>
            <li>Not only did that clear up in a day, but this is by far the best smelling tea tree soap that we&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>This helps since it has so many natural oils in it but doesn&#x27;t leave the skin greasy/oily at all.</li>
            <li>So when I saw this I thought it would be worth a try.  </li>
            <li>Smells and feels fresh after.</li>
            <li>In fact, I developed more athlete&#x27;s foot infection.</li>
            <li>It was worth buying.</li>
            <li>But worth the money compared, to after mat.</li>
            <li>So when I saw this I thought it would be worth a try.</li>
            <li>I went through many ointments, and nothing could help clear up my jock itch.</li>
            <li>Put this in a hand soap dispenser and love the cleaning action, the mint and tea tree smell.  </li>
            <li>I also love that it is all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>We love this product and Mountainbreeze Natural people who are so helpful.  </li>
            <li>That right there makes it worth the price we paid.</li>
            <li>Well guess what it has a very light, I mean VERY light and pleasant minty scent that you can only smell while in the shower.  </li>
            <li>This soap really helped me boost up my confidence and helped my feet feel and smell fresh!</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed the product very much as a body and foot wash so far.</li>
            <li>I used it in the shower right away, and I noticed that the itching had gone away.</li>
            <li>Right off the bat</li>
            <li>She has tried pretty much every over the counter product available including Proactive and nothing has seemed to work.</li>
            <li>My feet felt great and refreshed after each wash and noticed there was no longer buildup of fungus after first few uses.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s good as a primary body wash, because it dries your skin out too much, and it doesn&#x27;t have the typical &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; scent that you expect from soaps and body washes.  </li>
            <li>Not only does Funga-Free eliminate these problems for me, I love the cool feeling when it is applied to my feet.  </li>
            <li>We decided to try something else, something natural, that he can use on a more consistent basis without risking his health.</li>
            <li>so I am now using it as my everyday soap... nice product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s taking a bit longer to clear it up than I&#x27;d hoped, but that&#x27;s okay because these rashes are very stubborn.</li>
            <li>The soap is gentle on my skin, the scent is mild and refreshing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Feels great, especially after a long, hot day!</li>
            <li>small bottle is great for the sports bag or camping trip but would LOVE a LARGER bottle for both showers in our house.</li>
            <li>Not only is his skin smooth and well hydrated after using this product, but he couldn&#x27;t get over how *clean*</li>
            <li>I have only used this once a day on my foot and already notice a huge difference!  </li>
            <li>I have tried many antifungal washes but this is the only wash that has made a difference.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know what it was at first</li>
            <li>I really like the minty luxurious fragrance!</li>
            <li>Lovely Antifungal soap....has helped me with my bruising and the fungus in my big toe....</li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s the perfect balance where the mint overpowers the tea tree, or if the tea tree isn&#x27;t that big of a component in this one.</li>
            <li>but I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>I love this soap and use it in the shower regularly.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Great value.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>definitely recommend it, and am glad I came across it.</li>
            <li>The bottom line is I will most likely buy the product again once my bottle runs out.</li>
            <li>The problem, Ringworm, was first held in check and now seems banished.  </li>
            <li>I only wish there was more product for the price.</li>
            <li>Even after the first application, my feet felt noticeably softer.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says on the bottle.</li>
            <li>I bought this body wash to use at the gym but after my first shower with it I decided to get some for home too.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and tingle, and I&#x27;ve also used it as shampoo on my short hair.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>Funga-Free actually makes my skin feel better</li>
            <li>Antifungal soap was recommended to me by a friend to help with my feet stop itching and feeling funny after the gym.</li>
            <li>A small price to pay for an effective preventative!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to listen to customer service and not use as much to keep it economical.</li>
            <li>Most definitely recommended!</li>
            <li>works amazing and doesn&#x27;t smell as manly as some other antibacterial soaps.</li>
            <li>A luxuriously rich soft body wash, enhanced by fragrant botanicals and a tingling menthol sensation.</li>
            <li>some kind of fungus from bare feet walking, and body itch from heat and high humidity where I live.</li>
            <li>Last year I begin going to the gym regularly, after a good work out</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it enough to write a fair review yet, but I have noticed a definite &amp;#34;calming&amp;#34; of my skin.</li>
            <li>That very morning I washed the area with regular soap and it got better.</li>
            <li>Only wish the bottle was bigger but overall,a good product</li>
            <li>I like this body wash so much that only after using 3 times I have ordered 2 more bottles.  </li>
            <li>:) But it&#x27;s also very good at treating skin issues relating to fungus - slowly, as it&#x27;s a natural product and not a dangerously-souped-up mix of artificial substances.</li>
            <li>noticed that positive reviews predominate the review section, maybe the effect depends on person.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have calluses, just dry feet and most probable</li>
            <li>I bought this because I have a large bosom</li>
            <li>That smells like pure gasoline.</li>
            <li>First of all, my skin was pink and very clean looking.</li>
            <li>It has become a main stay supply for our household!</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this for anyone who works out a lot, after-sports, to general clean up on hot, humid days.</li>
            <li>The first thing that I noticed was an overall clean feeling on my feet and on my hands where I&#x27;d rubbed it in.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want a reaction or anything that would take an ok situation and turn it to bad, but I&#x27;m happy to report that I saw improvement after 2 uses.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed a difference in the smell immediately and my do not sweat as much as before.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is really helping with the fungus problem</li>
            <li>Seller is also very prompt and helpful.</li>
            <li>Gentle to the skin.</li>
            <li>This is a very soothing soap that you will feel as soon as it touches your skin.</li>
            <li>This seems to work really well for his feet.</li>
            <li>Its been working really well for me.</li>
            <li>Helps somewhat delivered fast</li>
            <li>Not 100% sure if you do that, it has better healing properties or not, but I emailed the co-founder to ask and they said he or she leaves it on his feet for a few minutes before washing, but simply uses it as a wash and immediately rinsing elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Really helping.</li>
            <li>Feet feel very refreshed after using.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t thanks to mountainbreeze..  </li>
            <li>I have purchased the soap for my daughter, she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>It works very well for my needs.</li>
            <li>I been using clotrimazole, but that does not help much and</li>
            <li>and I do not itch as much.  </li>
            <li>Mountainbreeze is also very diligent about Customer Service...</li>
            <li>After only two times of using Mountain Breeze antifungal soap I am wearing shorts and I&#x27;m rash free.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this absolutely.</li>
            <li>I have really sweaty feet from playing basketball and working out and was recommended this soap by a friend at the gym.</li>
            <li>This has been working very well</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who wants to pamper their feet.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone with a fungal problem!</li>
            <li>Second of all, my pores has opened to the point where I could see them, and my skin was smooth and supple.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t feel the itch as much.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Helga.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>so what do you have to lose really.</li>
            <li>It really works well.</li>
            <li>My skin feels overall cleaner and tingly fresh when I use this product and it does not have a medicinal smell - it just smells and feels fresh at the end.  </li>
            <li>I especially like to apply Funga-Free at bedtime, and then put on my favorite pair of soft socks.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that it has completely cleared up my fungal infection yet, but it has definitely controlled it from becoming any worse, and the itching and redness do seem to be greatly reduced.</li>
            <li>So excited to have something that finally works.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying colloidal silver drops and alongside other products was able to get the candida/itching issues under control.</li>
            <li>I leave it in the shower and have sometimes put it on my whole body after a particularly sweaty day.</li>
            <li>Not only did it clear up the problem, but my feet were so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>I use my normal body wash for the rest of the body for economic reasons.  </li>
            <li>Not only did it clear up the problem, but my feet were so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>Overall, we are completely satisfied with our purchase and will continue to use this product in the future.</li>
            <li>In short, I love the healing effects of this product and will continue to use it as my only body wash.</li>
            <li>I am mainly trying g to use it for my scalp fungus.  </li>
            <li>Natural remedies take time, and this body wash seems to have a positive effect.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>but I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It works to treat or prevent highly contagious fungal infections that includes athlete&#x27;s foot, ringworm and jock itch.</li>
            <li>So originally I was kind of skeptical, but based on the reviews I decided to try this out.</li>
            <li>Best of all, you only need a VERY small amount as it goes a long way</li>
            <li>but in some areas it is a little too potent perhaps,</li>
            <li>So many moisturizers and washes are just full of bad chemicals, but this one has natural ingredients which I just love.  </li>
            <li>Clean minty smell and body doesn&#x27;t feel dry.  </li>
            <li>I take my normal shower but plug the tub so my feet are soaking, my feet are softer.</li>
            <li>This is perfect, as for some reason I get weird skin colors and dry skin patches with pregnancy.</li>
            <li>I am still using the product and maybe will have a different opinion afterwards, but as of right now I recommend it.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I am very happy with the overall quality of this product, and will certainly be using this in the future.</li>
            <li>Typically I wash them after soaking in very warm water with some epsom salt and a few drops of tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>Resolved skin issues I thought I would have to live with</li>
            <li>This is a MUST if you live in a humid climate.</li>
            <li>it completely maintains your body fresh and removes all sorts of itching from upper to lowered body.</li>
            <li>OUR FEET FEEL REJOICE AND VERY SOFT.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to it and will get it if it&#x27;s on the mats.</li>
            <li>This is THE ONLY PRODUCT that has relieved my symptoms for the first time in 6 years.</li>
            <li>So when treating any rashes I have, I do the same by leaving it on for a minute first.</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s exact words were &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t ever wavy to use regular soap again.  </li>
            <li>As an avid participant in both basketball and weight lifting, I have experience numerous cases of foot fungus that became quite bothersome at times.</li>
            <li>I have a recurring fungal skin infection, and have used most other similar anti-fungal soap products on the market before...which sometimes helped to varying degrees.</li>
            <li>It leaves my feet feeling fresh and dry, and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>Just started using the product, not sure if it works, but it feels very clean everytime after wash.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this stuff to anyone with skin issues that haven&#x27;t had success with any other products.  </li>
            <li>Only thing, i wish it would lather a little more.</li>
            <li>Seems to help clear up some face/skin issues I have.</li>
            <li>The soap itself is clear in color.</li>
            <li>My wrestler has clear skin.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling ultimately clear.</li>
            <li>but using it on my toes nails seems to help clear up some of the fungus and the nails</li>
            <li>I have a skin fungal infections on my legs, arms, chest, and neck areas that just does not seem to clear up.  </li>
            <li>, It smells great and is an economical way to take care of an annoying problem.</li>
            <li>As far as customer service, I really appreciated the follow up email sent by the seller after we purchased, and the 45 day money back guarantee.</li>
            <li>Anyhow this is a natural product that is not harsh even for my face.</li>
            <li>My son is on his way to a complete recovery from athlete&#x27;s foot as a result of using this product.</li>
            <li>I have only used it a few times so far, but i love the minty tingle and effect it has had on my skin since it is all-natural.</li>
            <li>I found this product completely ineffective.  </li>
            <li>creme or a power can be left in place so that the anti-fungus ingredient has much longer to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All natural organic body wash.</li>
            <li>So asked manufacturer just how much tea tree oil is actually in the product.</li>
            <li>so this purchase will last me the whole summer I think.</li>
            <li>so far I do see a difference....</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife who has really stubborn acne on her back.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to keep it on hand for the dogs because one has really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>So far I like this body wash.  </li>
            <li>So far, no blisters and peeling.</li>
            <li>My teen daughter has much improved acne.</li>
            <li>I initially bought this soap for my acne, but didn&#x27;t help my stubborn acne much.</li>
            <li>that’s 100% natural and fungal fighter.</li>
            <li>I like that it is made from natural products and does not rely on chemicals.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll be 50 yrs old in October</li>
            <li>I am always for a product with no harsh chemicals or parabens.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve developed a foot fungus problem that pops up rather often.</li>
            <li>My wife found this looking for natural alternatives.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The ingredients are all natural and without petroleum byproduct.</li>
            <li>It contains tea tree oil, a natural antifungal, antibacterial and antiviral.</li>
            <li>So far it is doing the job</li>
            <li>Wow it had a freshing smell which I like.</li>
            <li>She says it&#x27;s working that the rash is slowly disappearing &amp; her skin is looking better.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been hitting the gym more and more trying to keep my new years resolution and as much as i hate to admit it, my feet have been a lil swampy and have a bit more funk than usual.</li>
            <li>I do not think a quick wash exposes the fungus long enough to the anti-fungus ingredient.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(they&#x27;re not painfully dry, but still dry enough) during the winter, and when I used this product to wash them I noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>My husband feet gets very sweaty through year and specially summer is quite hard with smells as well.  </li>
            <li>There is a high end feel with the product that really lets me know the quality is what I expected and</li>
            <li>I bought this for my older sons acne he was getting on his neck and back.</li>
            <li>had mainly bought the body wash to help with body acne as it as being advertised as an anti-bacterial and I sweat a lot especially after biking&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it daily, &amp; highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>He says it does not burn or sting and there is a slight smell which is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>Four treatments later my feet felt normal again.</li>
            <li>i also just started using it on my face and so far does not dry my skin.</li>
            <li>He made such a hype about it that I decided to use it on my feet (because I wore some shoes I shouldn&#x27;t have and developed Athlete&#x27;s Foot!).  </li>
            <li>The seller even send a follow up email about their product and offers a discount for the next purchase.</li>
            <li>After months of trying different things I came across this natural remedy.</li>
            <li>this is exactly what I was hoping for - something natural for everyday use that would prevent and clear up minor skin issues.</li>
            <li>I have not really had time to use and determine how the Antifungal Soap does for my use but as of now I really do like it and look forward to using it regularly.</li>
            <li>After only using it for about a week, her back is already starting to clear up!</li>
            <li>It is not irritating or drying like some antifungal soaps, probably due to the jojoba oil and other oils that mainly comprise this soap.</li>
            <li>Wash the infected area frequently, dry completely, then use a creme or powder in place for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li>There was not a great deal of lather, and it rinsed easily.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend has had &amp;#34;backne&amp;#34; (acne and breaking out on his back and upper arms) for as long as I can remember and the bumps are completely healed since he&#x27;s been using the soap.</li>
            <li>She loves it so much she started to put a little bit in our shampoos</li>
            <li>Use just a little foams fast.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and he said it was a good wash</li>
            <li> It has really good wholesome ingredients in it</li>
            <li> so I feel good about using it on my baby too if she ever needs it in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The soap feels good on the area where I have the fungus.  </li>
            <li> But it is a good addition to my shower routine to help rid myself of fungus, acne, and bacteria.</li>
            <li> I teach 6th grade, so I&#x27;m on my feet a good part of the day.</li>
            <li> After doing some research, I read that tea tree oil is really good for the skin.  </li>
            <li> Really good</li>
            <li> but maybe it is a good thing?</li>
            <li> Again good thing?</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> This body wash is good for us after the gym or if you are in a humid climate.</li>
            <li> Relieves the itching; skin feels good</li>
            <li> After doing some research, I read that tea tree oil is really good for the skin.</li>
            <li> the smell is great, the product not too medicinal smelly or girly, just a nice balanced soap that helps with the swamp feet / funky odors coming from my feet and sneakers.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t burn, felt good, smelt good.</li>
            <li> Good, prompt service.</li>
            <li> Works great, nice mint smell and tingling sensation.</li>
            <li> Cooling on the skin, smells good, very refreshing, good stuff</li>

            <li> It has a nice scent and a pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li> I am no longer able to get Fungi-Cure or GymSoap, both were great products.</li>
            <li> He is very very pleased.  </li>
            <li> This product does what it says it does, and we were very pleased not to smell like we had been sheep-dipped.  </li>
            <li> He hates most moisturizers because they leave his feet feeling greasy, so to say this has been a welcome change would be an understatement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very refreshing and cures jock itch and athletes feet.</li>
            <li> I really love this soap!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> Feeling confident, I kept using the wash and noticed that the rash had disappeared too!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> and the redness was better!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I do love this product!</li>
            <li> Because he sees his athletic foot has been getting better!  </li>
            <li> I just love this product!</li>
            <li> Since i started using this soap my feed smell much better!</li>

            <li> Love this wash!</li>
            <li> I would also like to note that the customer service from the company is amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and I will recommend it to anyone with skin issues.</li>
            <li> Received reply with lots of words but without answer, except to say that I can add my own tea tree oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really liked this.</li>
            <li> Nice quality product-</li>
            <li> If it is killing what it needs to kill perhaps there are bound to be some kind of a reaction.</li>
            <li> Nice peppermint smell</li>
            <li> He liked the way his skin felt and noticed a difference with his feet.  </li>
            <li> However, I can&#x27;t recommend it based on my own experience.</li>
            <li> It shipped fast, came in great packaging, and the bottle is a great size.</li>
            <li> It does smell really nice thoe.</li>
            <li> Customer service is excellent, and it feels good to use a natural product with visible benefits.  </li>
            <li> It does seem to help reduce itching and a nice minty smell.  </li>
            <li> I like it, and it smells nice.</li>
            <li> This product really helped me out after applying the Antifungal Soap and Body Wash to both my feet while I was in the shower and within days the fungus that was visible was no longer a problem so it happened to work out perfectly</li>
            <li> They take care of their customers which is nice to see these days.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use a pouf sponge and scrub good and a water filter for your shower wouldn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> Leaves you feeling very clean!</li>
            <li> , feels great and makes my feet feel tingly and fresh!</li>
            <li> Smells great, leaves feet feeling clean and refreshed.  </li>

            <li> The tea tree oil and peppermint smells great, and my son says that he feels clean and confident after using it.</li>
            <li> I really love how effective this product is.</li>
            <li> but this is by far the best!</li>
            <li> The soap itself has a nice tea tree oil scent that is not at all overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Refreshing body wash that lathers nicely</li>
            <li> Cycling is great exercise and lots of fun.</li>
            <li> When I first purchased this, I received an excellent email from the seller with detailed information about the ingredients and tips for use.  </li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product , so pleased that I ordered 2 more.</li>
            <li> The feel and smell is very soothing &amp; pepperminty &amp; a good price!</li>
            <li> Good product and worth the money!</li>
            <li> This is very good to the skin leaves it nice and soft.</li>
            <li> It smells great and is a great body wash overall!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many of the cheaper salicylic acid body washes and this has been the most effective.</li>
            <li> The body wash gave me a clean and confident feeling, and I highly recommend this product to anyone with any kind of fungal infection, or if you just want to smell great!</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was the great tea tree oil and the peppermint smell of the body wash.</li>
            <li> It smells really good because of the peppermint, but it’s not too strong, just a nice clean aroma.</li>
            <li> As a diabetic, the health of his feet are very important.</li>
            <li> easy to use  effective ..</li>
            <li> Funga-Free goes on smoothly &amp; absorbs quickly, and it smells VERY nice.  </li>
            <li> Relieves my itchy legs, which is huge relief!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although, this one is WAY better than Bronner&#x27;s magic tea tree soap.</li>
            <li> In fact, I already ordered a back-up bottle :)</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for a great product...</li>
            <li> I wish I knew about this soap before as I have tried many kinds before</li>
            <li> stopped itching for the most part.</li>
            <li> I wear low-heeled slip-on shoes most of the time, most of the time with no hosiery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased and reviewed many products with tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> glad that I did.</li>
            <li> Feels and smells refreshing and soothing.</li>
            <li> Better than soap.</li>
            <li> The tea tree oil and mint are so refreshing.</li>
            <li> and it gives a refreshing and almost tingling feeling when used (which i&#x27;m assuming is from the tea tree oil).</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be gone in no time.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> so I guess use it at night before bed and if it doesn&#x27;t create a problem for you, then it is safe to use in the morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the rate of progress, and with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already ordered more.</li>
            <li> but I have not had time to be sure.</li>
            <li> And I am sure its better for my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s feels refreshing and rejuvenating.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs into the skin well, and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feel like most retail</li>
            <li> Totally satisfied.</li>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it for long, but it seems to be fairly effective!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with my skin condition for some time now and tried many things and nothing ever really worked.</li>
            <li> Smells really good the entire day</li>
            <li> So far so good from someone who is constantly battling a fungus issue of some kind.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We also like the clean, pleasant scent, and as other reviewers have said, it makes for a fantastic deodorizer.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it creates itching in certain areas (LOL)</li>
            <li> Fresh clean scent of mint.</li>
            <li> Leaves you with a fresh, crash clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I feel clean and fresh always.</li>
            <li> Mild scent and</li>
            <li> Additionally, the seller took the time to personally follow up with me and make sure I was satisfied with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> The fact that it is all natural is a bonus and makes me more comfortable using the product.  </li>
            <li> and it has definitely made his skin feel much more comfortable !</li>
            <li> Works well and quickly for itch and blistering reduction.</li>
            <li> Also,  I am pregnant</li>
            <li> I can happily say that the rash has diminished quite a bit visibly and definitely doesn&#x27;t itch as much as it used to after using the body wash for about a week now.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve seen improvements quickly.</li>
            <li> It has the clean, crisp scent of peppermint that leaves you feeling smooth, fresh and energized.</li>
            <li> It has been very hot and humid here</li>
            <li> This soap works great in calming down irritants.</li>
            <li> Unlike some other similar products, this has a nice, light, pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> My feet is relieved of dry itchy skin and makes my feet feel good.</li>
            <li> Definitely ordering more!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s wonderful that this product is all natural, so it really does help with dry skin and itchiness.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a product that I could use everyday but also safe and effective.</li>
            <li> the overall product is nice quality.</li>
            <li> Not only did that clear up in a day, but this is by far the best smelling tea tree soap that we&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> This helps since it has so many natural oils in it but doesn&#x27;t leave the skin greasy/oily at all.</li>
            <li> So when I saw this I thought it would be worth a try.  </li>
            <li> Smells and feels fresh after.</li>
            <li> In fact, I developed more athlete&#x27;s foot infection.</li>
            <li> It was worth buying.</li>
            <li> But worth the money compared, to after mat.</li>
            <li> So when I saw this I thought it would be worth a try.</li>
            <li> I went through many ointments, and nothing could help clear up my jock itch.</li>
            <li> Put this in a hand soap dispenser and love the cleaning action, the mint and tea tree smell.  </li>
            <li> I also love that it is all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> We love this product and Mountainbreeze Natural people who are so helpful.  </li>
            <li> That right there makes it worth the price we paid.</li>
            <li> Well guess what it has a very light, I mean VERY light and pleasant minty scent that you can only smell while in the shower.  </li>
            <li> This soap really helped me boost up my confidence and helped my feet feel and smell fresh!</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed the product very much as a body and foot wash so far.</li>
            <li> I used it in the shower right away, and I noticed that the itching had gone away.</li>
            <li> Right off the bat</li>
            <li> She has tried pretty much every over the counter product available including Proactive and nothing has seemed to work.</li>
            <li> My feet felt great and refreshed after each wash and noticed there was no longer buildup of fungus after first few uses.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s good as a primary body wash, because it dries your skin out too much, and it doesn&#x27;t have the typical &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; scent that you expect from soaps and body washes.  </li>
            <li> Not only does Funga-Free eliminate these problems for me, I love the cool feeling when it is applied to my feet.  </li>
            <li> We decided to try something else, something natural, that he can use on a more consistent basis without risking his health.</li>
            <li> so I am now using it as my everyday soap... nice product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taking a bit longer to clear it up than I&#x27;d hoped, but that&#x27;s okay because these rashes are very stubborn.</li>
            <li> The soap is gentle on my skin, the scent is mild and refreshing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feels great, especially after a long, hot day!</li>
            <li> small bottle is great for the sports bag or camping trip but would LOVE a LARGER bottle for both showers in our house.</li>
            <li> Not only is his skin smooth and well hydrated after using this product, but he couldn&#x27;t get over how *clean*</li>
            <li> I have only used this once a day on my foot and already notice a huge difference!  </li>
            <li> I have tried many antifungal washes but this is the only wash that has made a difference.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what it was at first</li>
            <li> I really like the minty luxurious fragrance!</li>
            <li> Lovely Antifungal soap....has helped me with my bruising and the fungus in my big toe....</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s the perfect balance where the mint overpowers the tea tree, or if the tea tree isn&#x27;t that big of a component in this one.</li>
            <li> but I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> I love this soap and use it in the shower regularly.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Great value.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> definitely recommend it, and am glad I came across it.</li>
            <li> The bottom line is I will most likely buy the product again once my bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> The problem, Ringworm, was first held in check and now seems banished.  </li>
            <li> I only wish there was more product for the price.</li>
            <li> Even after the first application, my feet felt noticeably softer.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says on the bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought this body wash to use at the gym but after my first shower with it I decided to get some for home too.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and tingle, and I&#x27;ve also used it as shampoo on my short hair.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> Funga-Free actually makes my skin feel better</li>
            <li> Antifungal soap was recommended to me by a friend to help with my feet stop itching and feeling funny after the gym.</li>
            <li> A small price to pay for an effective preventative!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to listen to customer service and not use as much to keep it economical.</li>
            <li> Most definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> works amazing and doesn&#x27;t smell as manly as some other antibacterial soaps.</li>
            <li> A luxuriously rich soft body wash, enhanced by fragrant botanicals and a tingling menthol sensation.</li>
            <li> some kind of fungus from bare feet walking, and body itch from heat and high humidity where I live.</li>
            <li> Last year I begin going to the gym regularly, after a good work out</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it enough to write a fair review yet, but I have noticed a definite &amp;#34;calming&amp;#34; of my skin.</li>
            <li> That very morning I washed the area with regular soap and it got better.</li>
            <li> Only wish the bottle was bigger but overall,a good product</li>
            <li> I like this body wash so much that only after using 3 times I have ordered 2 more bottles.  </li>
            <li> :) But it&#x27;s also very good at treating skin issues relating to fungus - slowly, as it&#x27;s a natural product and not a dangerously-souped-up mix of artificial substances.</li>
            <li> noticed that positive reviews predominate the review section, maybe the effect depends on person.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have calluses, just dry feet and most probable</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have a large bosom</li>
            <li> That smells like pure gasoline.</li>
            <li> First of all, my skin was pink and very clean looking.</li>
            <li> It has become a main stay supply for our household!</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this for anyone who works out a lot, after-sports, to general clean up on hot, humid days.</li>
            <li> The first thing that I noticed was an overall clean feeling on my feet and on my hands where I&#x27;d rubbed it in.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want a reaction or anything that would take an ok situation and turn it to bad, but I&#x27;m happy to report that I saw improvement after 2 uses.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference in the smell immediately and my do not sweat as much as before.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is really helping with the fungus problem</li>
            <li> Seller is also very prompt and helpful.</li>
            <li> Gentle to the skin.</li>
            <li> This is a very soothing soap that you will feel as soon as it touches your skin.</li>
            <li> This seems to work really well for his feet.</li>
            <li> Its been working really well for me.</li>
            <li> Helps somewhat delivered fast</li>
            <li> Not 100% sure if you do that, it has better healing properties or not, but I emailed the co-founder to ask and they said he or she leaves it on his feet for a few minutes before washing, but simply uses it as a wash and immediately rinsing elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Really helping.</li>
            <li> Feet feel very refreshed after using.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t thanks to mountainbreeze..  </li>
            <li> I have purchased the soap for my daughter, she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> It works very well for my needs.</li>
            <li> I been using clotrimazole, but that does not help much and</li>
            <li> and I do not itch as much.  </li>
            <li> Mountainbreeze is also very diligent about Customer Service...</li>
            <li> After only two times of using Mountain Breeze antifungal soap I am wearing shorts and I&#x27;m rash free.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this absolutely.</li>
            <li> I have really sweaty feet from playing basketball and working out and was recommended this soap by a friend at the gym.</li>
            <li> This has been working very well</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who wants to pamper their feet.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone with a fungal problem!</li>
            <li> Second of all, my pores has opened to the point where I could see them, and my skin was smooth and supple.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t feel the itch as much.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Helga.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> so what do you have to lose really.</li>
            <li> It really works well.</li>
            <li> My skin feels overall cleaner and tingly fresh when I use this product and it does not have a medicinal smell - it just smells and feels fresh at the end.  </li>
            <li> I especially like to apply Funga-Free at bedtime, and then put on my favorite pair of soft socks.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it has completely cleared up my fungal infection yet, but it has definitely controlled it from becoming any worse, and the itching and redness do seem to be greatly reduced.</li>
            <li> So excited to have something that finally works.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying colloidal silver drops and alongside other products was able to get the candida/itching issues under control.</li>
            <li> I leave it in the shower and have sometimes put it on my whole body after a particularly sweaty day.</li>
            <li> Not only did it clear up the problem, but my feet were so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> I use my normal body wash for the rest of the body for economic reasons.  </li>
            <li> Not only did it clear up the problem, but my feet were so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> Overall, we are completely satisfied with our purchase and will continue to use this product in the future.</li>
            <li> In short, I love the healing effects of this product and will continue to use it as my only body wash.</li>
            <li> I am mainly trying g to use it for my scalp fungus.  </li>
            <li> Natural remedies take time, and this body wash seems to have a positive effect.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> but I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It works to treat or prevent highly contagious fungal infections that includes athlete&#x27;s foot, ringworm and jock itch.</li>
            <li> So originally I was kind of skeptical, but based on the reviews I decided to try this out.</li>
            <li> Best of all, you only need a VERY small amount as it goes a long way</li>
            <li> but in some areas it is a little too potent perhaps,</li>
            <li> So many moisturizers and washes are just full of bad chemicals, but this one has natural ingredients which I just love.  </li>
            <li> Clean minty smell and body doesn&#x27;t feel dry.  </li>
            <li> I take my normal shower but plug the tub so my feet are soaking, my feet are softer.</li>
            <li> This is perfect, as for some reason I get weird skin colors and dry skin patches with pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I am still using the product and maybe will have a different opinion afterwards, but as of right now I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I am very happy with the overall quality of this product, and will certainly be using this in the future.</li>
            <li> Typically I wash them after soaking in very warm water with some epsom salt and a few drops of tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> Resolved skin issues I thought I would have to live with</li>
            <li> This is a MUST if you live in a humid climate.</li>
            <li> it completely maintains your body fresh and removes all sorts of itching from upper to lowered body.</li>
            <li> OUR FEET FEEL REJOICE AND VERY SOFT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to it and will get it if it&#x27;s on the mats.</li>
            <li> This is THE ONLY PRODUCT that has relieved my symptoms for the first time in 6 years.</li>
            <li> So when treating any rashes I have, I do the same by leaving it on for a minute first.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s exact words were &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t ever wavy to use regular soap again.  </li>
            <li> As an avid participant in both basketball and weight lifting, I have experience numerous cases of foot fungus that became quite bothersome at times.</li>
            <li> I have a recurring fungal skin infection, and have used most other similar anti-fungal soap products on the market before...which sometimes helped to varying degrees.</li>
            <li> It leaves my feet feeling fresh and dry, and not greasy.  </li>
            <li> Just started using the product, not sure if it works, but it feels very clean everytime after wash.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this stuff to anyone with skin issues that haven&#x27;t had success with any other products.  </li>
            <li> Only thing, i wish it would lather a little more.</li>
            <li> Seems to help clear up some face/skin issues I have.</li>
            <li> The soap itself is clear in color.</li>
            <li> My wrestler has clear skin.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling ultimately clear.</li>
            <li> but using it on my toes nails seems to help clear up some of the fungus and the nails</li>
            <li> I have a skin fungal infections on my legs, arms, chest, and neck areas that just does not seem to clear up.  </li>
            <li> , It smells great and is an economical way to take care of an annoying problem.</li>
            <li> As far as customer service, I really appreciated the follow up email sent by the seller after we purchased, and the 45 day money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> Anyhow this is a natural product that is not harsh even for my face.</li>
            <li> My son is on his way to a complete recovery from athlete&#x27;s foot as a result of using this product.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times so far, but i love the minty tingle and effect it has had on my skin since it is all-natural.</li>
            <li> I found this product completely ineffective.  </li>
            <li> creme or a power can be left in place so that the anti-fungus ingredient has much longer to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All natural organic body wash.</li>
            <li> So asked manufacturer just how much tea tree oil is actually in the product.</li>
            <li> so this purchase will last me the whole summer I think.</li>
            <li> so far I do see a difference....</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife who has really stubborn acne on her back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to keep it on hand for the dogs because one has really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> So far I like this body wash.  </li>
            <li> So far, no blisters and peeling.</li>
            <li> My teen daughter has much improved acne.</li>
            <li> I initially bought this soap for my acne, but didn&#x27;t help my stubborn acne much.</li>
            <li> that’s 100% natural and fungal fighter.</li>
            <li> I like that it is made from natural products and does not rely on chemicals.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll be 50 yrs old in October</li>
            <li> I am always for a product with no harsh chemicals or parabens.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve developed a foot fungus problem that pops up rather often.</li>
            <li> My wife found this looking for natural alternatives.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The ingredients are all natural and without petroleum byproduct.</li>
            <li> It contains tea tree oil, a natural antifungal, antibacterial and antiviral.</li>
            <li> So far it is doing the job</li>
            <li> Wow it had a freshing smell which I like.</li>
            <li> She says it&#x27;s working that the rash is slowly disappearing &amp; her skin is looking better.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been hitting the gym more and more trying to keep my new years resolution and as much as i hate to admit it, my feet have been a lil swampy and have a bit more funk than usual.</li>
            <li> I do not think a quick wash exposes the fungus long enough to the anti-fungus ingredient.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (they&#x27;re not painfully dry, but still dry enough) during the winter, and when I used this product to wash them I noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> My husband feet gets very sweaty through year and specially summer is quite hard with smells as well.  </li>
            <li> There is a high end feel with the product that really lets me know the quality is what I expected and</li>
            <li> I bought this for my older sons acne he was getting on his neck and back.</li>
            <li> had mainly bought the body wash to help with body acne as it as being advertised as an anti-bacterial and I sweat a lot especially after biking&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it daily, &amp; highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> He says it does not burn or sting and there is a slight smell which is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Four treatments later my feet felt normal again.</li>
            <li> i also just started using it on my face and so far does not dry my skin.</li>
            <li> He made such a hype about it that I decided to use it on my feet (because I wore some shoes I shouldn&#x27;t have and developed Athlete&#x27;s Foot!).  </li>
            <li> The seller even send a follow up email about their product and offers a discount for the next purchase.</li>
            <li> After months of trying different things I came across this natural remedy.</li>
            <li> this is exactly what I was hoping for - something natural for everyday use that would prevent and clear up minor skin issues.</li>
            <li> I have not really had time to use and determine how the Antifungal Soap does for my use but as of now I really do like it and look forward to using it regularly.</li>
            <li> After only using it for about a week, her back is already starting to clear up!</li>
            <li> It is not irritating or drying like some antifungal soaps, probably due to the jojoba oil and other oils that mainly comprise this soap.</li>
            <li> Wash the infected area frequently, dry completely, then use a creme or powder in place for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li> There was not a great deal of lather, and it rinsed easily.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has had &amp;#34;backne&amp;#34; (acne and breaking out on his back and upper arms) for as long as I can remember and the bumps are completely healed since he&#x27;s been using the soap.</li>
            <li> She loves it so much she started to put a little bit in our shampoos</li>
            <li> Use just a little foams fast.</li>
            <li> This one bottle is big enough to last us a long time</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a difference.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to athletes and active individuals of all ages not only as treatment for foot fungus, but as a general body wash as well.</li>
            <li> So I bought this product when the price had been marked down to 16.99.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t entirely removed my problem yet (I&#x27;ve only been using it for a short time), but it is working well in concert with the other medicine I use</li>
            <li> Natural products typically take a while before you see results.</li>
            <li> It has a slightly minty scent, but not a heavy scent.</li>
            <li> read the product description and reviews then why not trying this natural ingredient which is oretty straight forward and nothing chemical behind it.  </li>
            <li> I only apply it to specific areas since the bottle is small and it&#x27;s more expensive than regular retail body washes.  </li>
            <li> The first one burned his feet, and the second one was expensive, only worked for a few minutes and really stunk.</li>
            <li> She really does work hard.</li>
            <li> Also he has athlatic foot, has been there for a long time now.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also, I like that it&#x27;s all natural because it ensures I&#x27;m not putting any harsh chemicals on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will be getting this as long as needed.</li>
            <li> I tried this soap for the first time yesterday and I must say I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised as I was a bit skeptical before.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, since my husband has been working out more to keep up with his New Year&#x27;s Resolution, he developed the uncomfortable skin issue that is jock itch.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I have a little fungus on big left toe nail.  </li>
            <li> This soap works as advertised, I have have athlete&#x27;s foot and have tried several other products.</li>
            <li> see from reading other reviews that a lot of people use it for sports related issues, such as athlete&#x27;s foot and other fungal infections.</li>
            <li> I have relatively dry hands</li>
            <li> I have a family member whose feet get terribly dry and itchy in winter, so after reading the ingredients on this stuff, I thought it might work well for that.</li>
            <li> i instantly was relieved almost with a cooling feel and it prevented it from coming back after a few uses.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a strong or unpleasant odor, or a gritty texture to it.</li>
            <li> I feel confident that this product is going to help my husband and that he can use it for a long time without bad side effects.</li>
            <li> only used Dove bar soap or body wash, used Eucerin skin products for eczema, tried &amp;#34;African black soaps&amp;#34;, shea soaps, oatmeal soaps...</li>
            <li> but I get some painful consequences, I am super sensitive with smell/odor</li>
            <li> And it can be used for a variety of other issues, like my dry skin and our teenager&#x27;s smelly feet.</li>
            <li> expensive , but worth it</li>
            <li> I have quite a few medical issues with my skin.</li>
            <li> Our son walks everywhere, and with it being so wet out, he wound up with athlete’s foot.</li>
            <li> but he only gets a few days of relief before it returns.</li>
            <li> My family uses this everyday now due to my occasionally flaky skin.</li>
            <li> I have had a history of dry, scaly feet, as well as toe fungus that made my toenails thick &amp; yellow.  </li>
            <li> know the cause, but at least she enjoys using this in the shower and it will help keep her skin healthier in general.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to athletes and just everyday people!</li>
            <li> He had itchy feet for a while and tried other products.</li>
            <li> I ordered the antifungal soap because after having gastric bypass surgery I was getting chronic yeast infections under my belly and other areas.  </li>
            <li> or so I plan to use it every other day or so, as a preventive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Removes all of what a normal body wash leaves behind.</li>
            <li> doe not do anything just like all other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; rip u off products.</li>
            <li> Unlike other AS, this one does not leave a film on your skin after washing.</li>
            <li> and there is no discernible difference other than price.</li>
            <li> This product is not hard on my skin, so I can leave it on longer without over drying it and irritating it before rinsing.</li>
            <li> that last for at least an hour after the shower, but when it comes to other areas no itching and the acne disappears.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t moisturize your skin so you may feel a little dry after using it, but the cooling feeling you get when using it outweighs that little issue that I have.  </li>
            <li> I assumed this was more crunchy people crap</li>
            <li> I sweat a lot and it keepsmy skin from  breaking down.</li>
            <li> Had it for about a week and a half</li>
            <li> I did notice that after he was washed he would itch less.</li>
            <li> My feet feel cleaner and less irritated.</li>
            <li> The only negative is the price for such a small bottle!!</li>
            <li> and she said  her feet hurt a little bit less.</li>
            <li> Little pricey.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
            <li> A little dab will do ya.</li>
            <li> A little research of tea tree oil</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;have gotten a little brighter</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for the terrible jock itch that troubles people in the hot weather.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I walked barefoot to the pool and not soon after developed athletes foot.</li>
            <li> For about 6 years, both of my shins have broken out with bumps that are itchy, especially at night.</li>
            <li> We are seeing some improvement with just a few uses.</li>
            <li> I just got the product a few weeks ago...</li>
            <li> Within a few days of using this body wash the body itch and hives on my body subsided.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll write another review after a few months.</li>
            <li> My discomfort and irritability was taken away in just a few days.</li>
            <li> After getting used to that I use it everyday in my shower.  </li>
            <li> that prescribed and OTC treatments were not successfully treating for very long.</li>
            <li> 2) hard working husband who wears heavy boots causing foot irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d begun to notice that my feet were starting to get a stale odor about halfway through the day</li>
            <li> Diabetes also causes/contributes to excessive sweating.</li>
            <li> No more smelly feet and shoes, or fungus.</li>
            <li> It feels like it balances the effects of the hard water.</li>
            <li> It inflamed the area making the muscles in the area swell hard, hurtful and itchy overnight.</li>
            <li> Not effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had itchy skin lately.</li>
            <li> So I treat my feet at least once a month.</li>
            <li> No more rashes!</li>
            <li> Since perhaps it is killing the fungus in those areas... and by areas I do mean &amp;#34;private&amp;#34; areas.</li>
            <li> Plan to keep checking for a less expensive product that works as well as yours.</li>
            <li> , I have very hard water that dries out the skin.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a very common skin fungus; I was hoping this would help it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The thing is that though this was very expensive and not worth it for me to buy again because it was a temporary measure.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my husband&#x27;s persistent jock itch has been a hindrance lately.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product.</li>
            <li> Sorry for him that it is natuare of his body</li>
            <li> Weird feel to it.</li>
            <li> We used it on our guinea pig that had some weird skin issues going on.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t cutting it.  </li>
            <li> It got to where my shoes were so bad that they were stinking up the closet at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it on my face after liking the results on my body - hesitantly, because to look at, my face doesn&#x27;t look bad, but I had some under the surface things going on.  </li>
            <li> but it is very inconvenient</li>
            <li> The smell was horrible until we tried this antifungal soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried another brand before this, and the odor was terrible.  </li>
            <li> 1)wrestler-avoiding the nasty staph or impetigo infections on the mat.</li>
            <li> Sprays were horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is not hard on my skin, so I can leave it on longer without over drying it and irritating it before rinsing. The seller even send a follow up email about their product and offers a discount for the next purchase. I hope this will help since I have a severe case of ringworm and regular soap and even prescription medication alone won&#x27;t do. Anyhow this is a natural product that is not harsh even for my face.</li>
            <li> I have only used this once a day on my foot and already notice a huge difference!  So excited to have something that finally works.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE PRODUCT. MY BOYFRIEND AND ME ARE GARDENERS AND SUFFER FROM CRACKED FEET AND WE SWEAT A LOT IN SUMMER .  OUR FEET FEEL REJOICE AND VERY SOFT.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have a large bosom and I get heat rashes underneath in the warmer months. It&#x27;s taking a bit longer to clear it up than I&#x27;d hoped, but that&#x27;s okay because these rashes are very stubborn. My boyfriend has had &amp;#34;backne&amp;#34; (acne and breaking out on his back and upper arms) for as long as I can remember and the bumps are completely healed since he&#x27;s been using the soap. Also, I asked the question &amp;#34;does it rinse clean&amp;#34; - I&#x27;m a stickler for needing to feel squeaky clean after my shower - and in my opinion, it does indeed leave a clean, refreshed, nicely rinsed feeling.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff!!! Does the job, and gets rid of foot odor!</li>
            <li> This product works. I have used it in combination with anti fungal cream.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed the product very much as a body and foot wash so far. I have a history of athletes foot so I bought this to keep it at bay and it&#x27;s working solidly as I have no signs for the last month while using it. They put together a very nice blend of natural ingredients that all seem to leave you clean, moisturized, and without fungus.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It makes my skin feel great. I will order this again.</li>
            <li> I have been using the antifungal soap for a week now and I have noticed a huge difference. I&#x27;m a college athlete and my feet get sweaty and smelly. I have tried many antifungal washes but this is the only wash that has made a difference. My feet feel refreshed and clean after every wash. I have noticed a difference in the smell immediately and my do not sweat as much as before. I would definitely recommend this product to athletes and just everyday people!</li>
            <li> My son loves to work out at the gym. This let to some athlete&#x27;s foot. The smell was horrible until we tried this antifungal soap. My son is on his way to a complete recovery from athlete&#x27;s foot as a result of using this product. The tea tree oil and peppermint smells great, and my son says that he feels clean and confident after using it. Overall, we are completely satisfied with our purchase and will continue to use this product in the future.</li>
            <li> Funga-Free works well controlling and curing a fungal infection.  It does not have a strong smell like some of the products I have used.  I would have given it 5 stars but it&#x27;s twice the price I would spend on Fungi-Cure or GymSoap.  I am no longer able to get Fungi-Cure or GymSoap, both were great products.</li>
            <li> Each year I struggle with a reoccurring fungal infection. I wanted to try a product that I could use everyday but also safe and effective. I found what I needed with the Antifungal Soap with Tea Tree oil. The soap is gentle on my skin, the scent is mild and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy I took the chance and purchased the Antifungal soap with natural Tea Tree oil. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It smells great and is a great body wash overall! I have only used it a few times so far, but i love the minty tingle and effect it has had on my skin since it is all-natural.</li>
            <li> Helga,  Yes I like the product as it has knocked out the itching on various parts of my body.  Dr. says it kills the yeast growth.  I will continue to use your product for now.  Plan to keep checking for a less expensive product that works as well as yours.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:973835c1eba4b72ca5e7bbf0389f7e5c]] I had some red blotches on my stomach and back so I saw a doctor for it, he recommended putting some fungus cream on it or finding a wash for it.&lt;br /&gt;I mentioned this brand and he said it was a good wash so I went ahead and bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting some medicine smelling stuff like my dandruff shampoo but this was the total opposite. It smells like the tea tree oil and peppermint shampoo that they sell at Trader Joes. I&#x27;ve used it several times this week all over my body and I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is really helping with the fungus problem and I feel so clean and confident. I&#x27;m happy I found this for the family. It has really good wholesome ingredients in it and it isn&#x27;t drying to my skin either, so I feel good about using it on my baby too if she ever needs it in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also theres a lot that comes in the bottle so it will definitely last a while.&lt;br /&gt;If you found this video helpful please give thumbs up. Thank you</li>
            <li> I got this soap for my daughter...she has problems with eczema...she started to get a rash on her shoulders &amp; asked me what should she do? I came across this soap. She says it&#x27;s working that the rash is slowly disappearing &amp; her skin is looking better.</li>
            <li> I really love how effective this product is. Last year I begin going to the gym regularly, after a good work out I would go to the pool. Unfortunately I walked barefoot to the pool and not soon after developed athletes foot. I didn&#x27;t know what it was at first but after realizing my problem I begin to buy a variety of products. After months of trying different things I came across this natural remedy. I&#x27;m glad I found something that does what it says, it ships fast and the follow up from Mountain breeze Naturals was great. I still use it to this day for fungal prevention and would definitely recommend this to anyone who what a product that works.</li>
            <li> I have been using Funga-Free Body Wash for five days now and the fungus is decreasing.  The soap feels good on the area where I have the fungus.  Based on my progress I will definitely be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> I really like the minty luxurious fragrance! The soothing smell compliments the clean feeling of the product. There is a high end feel with the product that really lets me know the quality is what I expected and then some! I am glad that the soap can be used all over like dry chaffed elbows and has a great fragrance. I am thinking gifting this product is something that I know now is something I can rely on being delivered promptly and the overall product is nice quality.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product. For about 6 years, both of my shins have broken out with bumps that are itchy, especially at night. I visited the dermatologist and tried prescriptions for contact dermatitis, changed detergent to free/clear ALL, changed soaps... only used Dove bar soap or body wash, used Eucerin skin products for eczema, tried &amp;#34;African black soaps&amp;#34;, shea soaps, oatmeal soaps... This is THE ONLY PRODUCT that has relieved my symptoms for the first time in 6 years. The ONLY reason that it doesn&#x27;t get 4 stars is because, like most tea tree oil products, there is a weird &amp;#34;gasoline-smell&amp;#34;. Although, this one is WAY better than Bronner&#x27;s magic tea tree soap. That smells like pure gasoline.</li>
            <li> I found this product completely ineffective.  I do not think a quick wash exposes the fungus long enough to the anti-fungus ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A creme or a power can be left in place so that the anti-fungus ingredient has much longer to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately I found that that both a generic creme with 1% clotrimazole or a mixture of zinc oxide mixed with talcum power at about 1:5 worked well for me. Wash the infected area frequently, dry completely, then use a creme or powder in place for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li> My family uses this everyday now due to my occasionally flaky skin. Not only did that clear up in a day, but this is by far the best smelling tea tree soap that we&#x27;ve ever used! Seller is also very prompt and helpful. 11/10</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.  My husband gets ringworm all over his torso.  I decided to get this for him even though it might smell.  Well guess what it has a very light, I mean VERY light and pleasant minty scent that you can only smell while in the shower.  Oh...the best thing about it...it has been three days and the ringworm is almost all gone!!!!!!!  He is very very pleased.  When he runs out I will definitely be buying this again.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! The feel and smell is very soothing &amp; pepperminty &amp; a good price!</li>
            <li> Fresh clean scent of mint.All natural organic body wash. Gentle to the skin. We are seeing some improvement with just a few uses. We use it daily and is also good for shampoo. One product for total head to toe skin care.</li>
            <li> The only soap I have purchased that provides relief. I suffer from multiple skin conditions that can ruin my days. I shower daily with this soap.</li>
            <li> The Pros: Soothing, invigorating, pleasant; leaves skin soft and smooth after swimming.&lt;br /&gt;The Con: I&#x27;m not seeing any change in the tinnea versicolor on my back.  That&#x27;s a very common skin fungus; I was hoping this would help it.&lt;br /&gt;Still, it&#x27;s one of the nicer body washes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Unlike some other similar products, this has a nice, light, pleasant scent.  I like it.  In fact, I already ordered a back-up bottle :)</li>
            <li> Lovely Antifungal soap....has helped me with my bruising and the fungus in my big toe....Thank you so much for a great product...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t  seem to help with the itching.</li>
            <li> I really love this soap! I feel so fresh after I shower with it and the freshness lasts! I wish I knew about this soap before as I have tried many kinds before but this is by far the best! I love it so much I almost want to drink it! :)</li>
            <li> Purchased product. Not effective. So asked manufacturer just how much tea tree oil is actually in the product. Received reply with lots of words but without answer, except to say that I can add my own tea tree oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only antifungal ingredient would be the tea tree oil in the product. So it&#x27;s really fair to know how much is in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars.</li>
            <li> expensive , but worth it</li>
            <li> Very good quality anti-fungal soap.. Definitely is in my daily regimine to help with summer heat exacerbation. Best of all, you only need a VERY small amount as it goes a long way so this purchase will last me the whole summer I think. Thank you MountainBreeze!</li>
            <li> This wash is wonderful! I have quite a few medical issues with my skin. I now use this product exclusively as my only body wash. My skin cracks easily and this product has helped more than anything that I have ever used (even better than prescription products). It seems to be working in a cumulitive way. With consistent use my skin just gets better and better. In short, I love the healing effects of this product and will continue to use it as my only body wash. As an extra bonus it helps with itchy skin dramatically.</li>
            <li> I just got the product a few weeks ago... so far I do see a difference.... stopped itching for the most part. Still to soon to see a big difference.</li>
            <li> Had it for about a week and a half and it works fine for me, I have very hard water that dries out the skin. This helps since it has so many natural oils in it but doesn&#x27;t leave the skin greasy/oily at all. It feels like it balances the effects of the hard water. Plus it keeps body acne under control and won&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
            <li> This is a very soothing soap that you will feel as soon as it touches your skin. It doesn&#x27;t moisturize your skin so you may feel a little dry after using it, but the cooling feeling you get when using it outweighs that little issue that I have.  I use it on my face as well.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s good as a primary body wash, because it dries your skin out too much, and it doesn&#x27;t have the typical &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; scent that you expect from soaps and body washes.  But it is a good addition to my shower routine to help rid myself of fungus, acne, and bacteria. I will continue to buy this soap.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my husband. He had itchy feet for a while and tried other products. This seems to work really well for his feet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had itchy skin lately. So I&#x27;ve been switching out soaps to find the one that works best. So far this is my favorite! Its been working really well for me.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and it smells and feels great! Gives you peace of mind that its protecting you!</li>
            <li> Great product, excellent service!!</li>
            <li> I teach 6th grade, so I&#x27;m on my feet a good part of the day. I wear low-heeled slip-on shoes most of the time, most of the time with no hosiery. I&#x27;d begun to notice that my feet were starting to get a stale odor about halfway through the day~I could smell it sometimes even when I didn&#x27;t take my shoes off and I was just sitting at the computer or at my desk. It got to where my shoes were so bad that they were stinking up the closet at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I did some research on the computer and saw this product: Antifungal Soap and Body Wash with Tea Tree. I&#x27;m a big fan of tea tree. I&#x27;ve purchased and reviewed many products with tea tree oil. So I bought this product when the price had been marked down to 16.99.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad that I did. The first thing that I noticed was an overall clean feeling on my feet and on my hands where I&#x27;d rubbed it in.There was not a great deal of lather, and it rinsed easily. That night I rubbed my feet up against my hubby and he complemented the feel of my feet. I&#x27;ve also begun to notice (or not notice) the smell. It&#x27;s eliminated from my feet, and I don&#x27;t smell it during the day anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband and teenage son are going to start using this soap, also, since I&#x27;ve been talking about it. They both like the smell, and the fact that it&#x27;s not in a &amp;#34;girlie&amp;#34; bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to continue to use the soap for my feet and as a body wash.</li>
            <li> I really liked this. Will be ordering again soon.</li>
            <li> Helps somewhat delivered fast</li>
            <li> Nice quality product- Feels and smells refreshing and soothing. Better than soap. It feels cooling if you leave it on for a minute or two. Not 100% sure if you do that, it has better healing properties or not, but I emailed the co-founder to ask and they said he or she leaves it on his feet for a few minutes before washing, but simply uses it as a wash and immediately rinsing elsewhere. So when treating any rashes I have, I do the same by leaving it on for a minute first. Even if the rashes don&#x27;t go away because of the product, I&#x27;d still continue to use this as the ingredients are great. I may alternate with a stronger tea-tree soap as well. I don&#x27;t smell the tea-tree at all, just the minty smell. Not sure if it&#x27;s the perfect balance where the mint overpowers the tea tree, or if the tea tree isn&#x27;t that big of a component in this one.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing!  Unfortunately, since my husband has been working out more to keep up with his New Year&#x27;s Resolution, he developed the uncomfortable skin issue that is jock itch.  After doing some research, I read that tea tree oil is really good for the skin.  So when I saw this I thought it would be worth a try.  It worked so well and quickly!  My husband said not only did it relieve the discomfort, but it soothed his skin.  He made such a hype about it that I decided to use it on my feet (because I wore some shoes I shouldn&#x27;t have and developed Athlete&#x27;s Foot!).  This stuff smells so good!  I love it!  Not only did it clear up the problem, but my feet were so soft and smooth! The tea tree oil and mint are so refreshing. I will definitely be adding this to my water every time I do an at- home pedicure.</li>
            <li> Mild scent and it works great on my dry cracked heals! What a great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a week and I can already see results on an itchy mystery rash that my PCP and dermatologist haven&#x27;t helped me with.  After putting up with the rash for almost three years, I am finally getting some relief.  I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> works great has a great smell to it. I sweat a lot and it keepsmy skin from  breaking down. This is my 2nd bottle and I still love it!!</li>
            <li> Very good product. Seems to help clear up some face/skin issues I have. Little pricey.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife who has really stubborn acne on her back. She has tried pretty much every over the counter product available including Proactive and nothing has seemed to work. After only using it for about a week, her back is already starting to clear up! I would highly recommend this stuff to anyone with skin issues that haven&#x27;t had success with any other products.  She loves it so much she started to put a little bit in our shampoos and it gives a refreshing and almost tingling feeling when used (which i&#x27;m assuming is from the tea tree oil). This one bottle is big enough to last us a long time but I will definitely be buying more. I would also like to note that the customer service from the company is amazing. I reached out to them with a couple questions before ordering and they were very friendly and quick with the replies.</li>
            <li> The soap itself has a nice tea tree oil scent that is not at all overwhelming. The soap itself is clear in color. Gave it to my grandmother who is suffering from foot fungus and she said  her feet hurt a little bit less. We&#x27;ll just keep applying it every day and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be gone in no time. I also tried some myself in the shower and it removed the odor from my body. If you&#x27;re suffering from foot fungus or athlete&#x27;s foot, you have to buy this soap.</li>
            <li> Since I play a lot of sports I sometimes get fungus on my feet. So I have been looking for a really good anti fungal soap that is smells good while being effective. I especially love the peppermint aroma the soap leaves after each use. Each use feels great and I have a clean and confident feeling because I no longer have to worry about my feet.</li>
            <li> Perfect at deodorizing. Just what we wanted.</li>
            <li> This product smells wonderful and I am very pleased with it!!!</li>
            <li> Hi everyone! There were some circular sores scattered around my upper body which I believed to be ringworm. I looked for some products on amazon that might help me cure this problem. So after reading some of the great reviews, I decided to give this body wash a try. The first thing I noticed was the great tea tree oil and the peppermint smell of the body wash. It has a nice scent and a pleasant aroma. I used it in the shower right away, and I noticed that the itching had gone away. Feeling confident, I kept using the wash and noticed that the rash had disappeared too! The body wash gave me a clean and confident feeling, and I highly recommend this product to anyone with any kind of fungal infection, or if you just want to smell great!</li>
            <li> Is doing what it is advertised to do. Will probably keep some in home at all times.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Product arrived quickly:)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey but it smells great, feels great and makes my feet feel tingly and fresh!</li>
            <li> Really helping. Glad I bought it. I use this along with a cream.</li>
            <li> Arrived as stated, Soap is great!!!&amp;#34;   Cannot be without it.  No more rashes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and it seems to be working. It is not irritating or drying like some antifungal soaps, probably due to the jojoba oil and other oils that mainly comprise this soap. Feet feel very refreshed after using. Typically I wash them after soaking in very warm water with some epsom salt and a few drops of tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it enough to write a fair review yet, but I have noticed a definite &amp;#34;calming&amp;#34; of my skin.</li>
            <li> I used it on my dog because he kept itching before I realized that it was allergies. I did notice that after he was washed he would itch less. I&#x27;m going to keep it on hand for the dogs because one has really sensitive skin and he finds this soothing. (Plus, I like the smell.)</li>
            <li> I have been skiing for the last two weeks in Colorado and it&#x27;s been very warm . I sweat a lot anyway and suffer from fungal skin problems when exercising a lot and sweating .&lt;br /&gt;This body wash has completely kept by fungal skin problems in check during this trip which is amazing .&lt;br /&gt;Nothing else I&#x27;ve tried has done this .</li>
            <li> I ordered the antifungal soap because after having gastric bypass surgery I was getting chronic yeast infections under my belly and other areas.  This soap has cleared up my yeast infections!!  My skin feels so clean, no residue.  I use it daily, &amp; highly recommend.  I&#x27;ve tried another brand before this, and the odor was terrible.  This brand by Mountain Breeze is also cheaper.  It does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> I do like the soap. I do feel very clean after using it. The only thing is that it creates itching in certain areas (LOL) that last for at least an hour after the shower, but when it comes to other areas no itching and the acne disappears. Really good but in some areas it is a little too potent perhaps, but maybe it is a good thing? Since perhaps it is killing the fungus in those areas... and by areas I do mean &amp;#34;private&amp;#34; areas. Again good thing? If it is killing what it needs to kill perhaps there are bound to be some kind of a reaction. It doesn&#x27;&#x27;t kill you but it is very inconvenient so I guess use it at night before bed and if it doesn&#x27;t create a problem for you, then it is safe to use in the morning. The thing is that though this was very expensive and not worth it for me to buy again because it was a temporary measure. I ended up buying colloidal silver drops and alongside other products was able to get the candida/itching issues under control.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm - first, it&#x27;s a good soap. A little dab will do ya. :) But it&#x27;s also very good at treating skin issues relating to fungus - slowly, as it&#x27;s a natural product and not a dangerously-souped-up mix of artificial substances. I&#x27;m satisfied with the rate of progress, and with this product. I will buy it again when I run out. (If I need to, that is.)</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Work on my son skin problem!!</li>
            <li> I used this for toenail fungus.  I saw an immediate difference in the nails.  Fungus was gone in about 5-6 weeks after using it as directed.</li>
            <li> Great body wash, leaves the skin moisturized and soft.  Has a nice fresh smell, not too strong.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this soap and use it in the shower regularly.  Nice peppermint smell and you get squeaky clean!</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Great value.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap as part of my treatment regimen for Rosacea,  because it has tea tree oil in it.  The combination of tea tree oil and peppermint leaves my skin feeling refreshed and pleasantly tingly.  When I first purchased this, I received an excellent email from the seller with detailed information about the ingredients and tips for use.  Additionally, the seller took the time to personally follow up with me and make sure I was satisfied with my purchase.  I recomnend both the body wash and the seller.</li>
            <li> So far so good - bought this for my mother and she has found it very refreshing. Time will tell if it will help her skin eruptions heal, since neither we nor her various MDs, dermatologists and acupuncturists, etc. know the cause, but at least she enjoys using this in the shower and it will help keep her skin healthier in general.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Resolved skin issues I thought I would have to live with but I don&#x27;t thanks to mountainbreeze..  The fact that it is all natural is a bonus and makes me more comfortable using the product.  I&#x27;ve already ordered more.</li>
            <li> Works well and good smell!</li>
            <li> It seems to work but I have not had time to be sure.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because when I work out, especially at the gym, I want to both rehydrate and refresh my skin and feet, but also get rid of any bacteria I may have picked up from such a public place.  It feels great and smells wonderful and really helps my feet stay moisturized so they dont dry out.  Because its 100% natural it also makes me feel good using it.  So many moisturizers and washes are just full of bad chemicals, but this one has natural ingredients which I just love.  And I am sure its better for my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend it, and am glad I came across it.</li>
            <li> It appears to be clearing up my toe fungus, which is great. However, I also find that it keeps my skin moist so I am now using it as my everyday soap... nice product!</li>
            <li> Convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Within a few days of using this body wash the body itch and hives on my body subsided. However, the itch on the bottom of my feet increased. I wanted to try their foot salt soak but the product had been sold out in Amazon. Consequently, I purchased the ingredients separately and prepared a soak for my feet using bath salts, tea tree and mint oils. Relieve started after the 2nd treatment. Four treatments later my feet felt normal again. I don&#x27;t have calluses, just dry feet and most probable some kind of fungus from bare feet walking, and body itch from heat and high humidity where I live. The itch on my feet and body was unbereable. I&#x27;ll keep using the body wash a bit longer for fear of getting back the itch and hives. After a month or so I plan to use it every other day or so, as a preventive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend the use of the body wash between your buttocks. It inflamed the area making the muscles in the area swell hard, hurtful and itchy overnight. That very morning I washed the area with regular soap and it got better. After 3 showers using regular soap in the area the muscle softened up, and the pain and itch was gone. There&#x27;s should be a warning about this.</li>
            <li> So far I like this body wash.  It&#x27;s feels refreshing and rejuvenating.  It absorbs into the skin well, and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feel like most retail&lt;br /&gt;brands.  It seems to keep fungal growth at bay.  Natural remedies take time, and this body wash seems to have a positive effect.  I only apply it to specific areas since the bottle is small and it&#x27;s more expensive than regular retail body washes.  I use my normal body wash for the rest of the body for economic reasons.  I&#x27;m a big fan of tea tree oil, and I like the aroma.  The bottom line is I will most likely buy the product again once my bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> This product does what it says it does, and we were very pleased not to smell like we had been sheep-dipped.  The problem, Ringworm, was first held in check and now seems banished.  We have not switched back to &amp;#34;Regular&amp;#34; soap but rather have decided to continue to use this product on a daily basis.  In short, &amp;#34;Works for me,&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I originally stumbled on this product when my teammate let me know how they got rid of their athletes foot! I&#x27;ve been using the product for a week now and already have experienced results! I would recommend this product to ANYONE!!!</li>
            <li> It delivers as promised. I only wish there was more product for the price.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this product for 3 weeks and it has definitely made his skin feel much more comfortable ! He says it does not burn or sting and there is a slight smell which is not unpleasant. It has been very hot and humid here and he is a welder, so anything that can help with the rash and itching is a plus !</li>
            <li> Works well and quickly for itch and blistering reduction. Even after the first application, my feet felt noticeably softer. So far, no blisters and peeling.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Leaves you feeling very clean! Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Seller&#x27;s email about the product and how to use was helpful. Just started using the product, not sure if it works, but it feels very clean everytime after wash.</li>
            <li> Great so far. I did notice it takes a couple of weeks of daily use to see improvements.</li>
            <li> So good for my sensitive skin! Definitely ordering more! I have purchased the soap for my daughter, she absolutely loves it.  The soap has helped her acne!</li>
            <li> This treated the issue I intended to use the product to solve.</li>
            <li> 3 uses in our family. 1)wrestler-avoiding the nasty staph or impetigo infections on the mat. 2) hard working husband who wears heavy boots causing foot irritation. 3) teen acne fighter. My wrestler has clear skin. My husband has happy feet. My teen daughter has much improved acne. Will definitely keep buying this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small bottle is great for the sports bag or camping trip but would LOVE a LARGER bottle for both showers in our house.</li>
            <li> I initially bought this soap for my acne, but didn&#x27;t help my stubborn acne much. Feels great, especially after a long, hot day! I will buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;E.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my older sons acne he was getting on his neck and back. After just the first use he said his skin felt so much better and the redness was better!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend tried this and his feet ended up turning bright red and burning and itching.</li>
            <li> Good product. Not too strong tea tree oil smell.It does exactly what it says on the bottle. Totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!! Removes all of what a normal body wash leaves behind. Leaves skin feeling ultimately clear.</li>
            <li> Refreshing body wash that lathers nicely</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this body wash. I purchased this for my husband and myself. We have skin problems (dis-coloration, itchiness)  and this product is safe. Tea tree oil is wonderful stuff that’s 100% natural and fungal fighter. I feel confident that this product is going to help my husband and that he can use it for a long time without bad side effects.Also,  I am pregnant so I can’t use anything with chemicals, as that would hurt the baby(A boy by the way!). This is perfect, as for some reason I get weird skin colors and dry skin patches with pregnancy. Great for preventing problems too. A little research of tea tree oil and you see you have to give this a chance. It smells really good because of the peppermint, but it’s not too strong, just a nice clean aroma. Also, the seller is wonderful! Overall great product, I recommend even if your using a fungal cream for something like athletes foot, add this to the routine and get healed faster.</li>
            <li> I bought this body wash to use at the gym but after my first shower with it I decided to get some for home too. It&#x27;s cool minty smell is as soothing to the nose as the aloe vera is to the skin. Bottom line, I really love this stuff. I would recommend it to anyone, either for home or gym. FIVE STARS!</li>
            <li> Cooling on the skin, smells good, very refreshing, good stuff</li>
            <li> The order process was very easy with the product being on amazon prime, so I received a convenient and well packaged 2 day&lt;br /&gt;delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had mainly bought the body wash to help with body acne as it as being advertised as an anti-bacterial and I sweat a lot especially after biking&lt;br /&gt;to and from work in the Houston summer. While it hasn&#x27;t been effective for that, I liked how it gives me a good lather without dehydrating my skin and leaving it dry.</li>
            <li> Initially I used this product for athletes foot along with Lotrimin.  The issue has cleared up and now I am using only the Funga-Free Foot Wash.  I like that it is made from natural products and does not rely on chemicals.  I will continue using this product several times a week as a prevention from future outbreaks of athlete&#x27;s foot.</li>
            <li> I love that it smells minty and leaves my feet soft ,thankz i will purchase more</li>
            <li> I am quite satisfied with the ​Funga-Free body wash. It hasn&#x27;t entirely removed my problem yet (I&#x27;ve only been using it for a short time), but it is working well in concert with the other medicine I use (Baza Moisture Barrier Anti-Fungal Cream, also ordered through Amazon). I love the smell and tingle, and I&#x27;ve also used it as shampoo on my short hair. I&#x27;ll definitely be reordering at some point soon.</li>
            <li> Natural products typically take a while before you see results. Not so with this product. After the initial use, my husband noticed a difference. He liked the way his skin felt and noticed a difference with his feet.  As a diabetic, the health of his feet are very important. He&#x27;s suffered with athlete&#x27;s foot for years without noticing a difference with continued use of prescription meds. Diabetes also causes/contributes to excessive sweating. I&#x27;d read online that antimicrobial soaps are supposed to help with that. After using multiple brands, we&#x27;ve only noticed a difference by using this product. I have to admit, I&#x27;m extremely impressed! My husband&#x27;s exact words were &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t ever wavy to use regular soap again.  You have to buy this again!&amp;#34; He&#x27;s used it for about a week now and his feelings haven&#x27;t changed. He even bragged about how clean it made his hair feel and how it lathered. He&#x27;s happy,  I&#x27;m ecstatic!</li>
            <li> This body wash is good for us after the gym or if you are in a humid climate. It has a slightly minty scent, but not a heavy scent. It leaves skin feeling cool and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Great stuff... Wish it had some coconut oil in its formula. That would be perfect for an all body wash/rinse.</li>
            <li> Smells and feels fresh after. I like it! Pricey for the amount but I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for providing a product that does an excellent job of thoroughly cleaning the affected area. God bless and keep up the great work.</li>
            <li> Got my product on time wish is always a plus.  Just start using it so I will give a update after.  I am mainly trying g to use it for my scalp fungus.  Hope it works. In the meantime does anybody know anything that works for scalp fungus?  Update review - so far no change getting kind of discouraged. I use it twice a day as I shower.  Morning and night.  Hopefully something improves.</li>
            <li> Great product! My feet feel cleaner and less irritated. I will reorder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using this product recently - so far so good! I do Jiu Jitsu and I&#x27;m plagued by ring worm. I&#x27;m very sensitive to it and will get it if it&#x27;s on the mats. I&#x27;ve done jiu jitsu for 6 yrs and have battled this the entire time. I&#x27;ve almost quit doing the sport several times over this - but I&#x27;ll be 50 yrs old in October and I&#x27;m in great health and in great shape - and I&#x27;d like to stay that way. I&#x27;m hoping that using Funga-free as a body wash in the morning and after jiu jitsu will help out. I&#x27;ve had no ring worm since using it. I&#x27;ll write another review after a few months.</li>
            <li> Leaves you with a fresh, crash clean feeling. I am always for a product with no harsh chemicals or parabens. Only wish the bottle was bigger but overall,a good product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been used it at least once per day for at least 2 months since the weather got warm. It did not help at all. In fact, I developed more athlete&#x27;s foot infection. I played soccer twice a week. After playing, I immediately used it to wash my feet, but it just did not have any effect.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it one more star because it seems indeed prevent some foot stinky. But I bought it because the description said that it could treat athlete&#x27;s foot.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that positive reviews predominate the review section, maybe the effect depends on person. However, I can&#x27;t recommend it based on my own experience. I&#x27;m unsatisfied.</li>
            <li> Yes, I have a little fungus on big left toe nail.  The doctor did not want to give me meds told me they do no work.  I told him what I was doing and using, said that the body wash should help!</li>
            <li> This is just an excellent product!  I use it regularly.  It made a believer out of me.</li>
            <li> It kind of stinks but using it on my toes nails seems to help clear up some of the fungus and the nails&lt;br /&gt;have gotten a little brighter</li>
            <li> Very good product it completely maintains your body fresh and removes all sorts of itching from upper to lowered body. It was worth buying.</li>
            <li> I like it. Works well, it would be better if it lathered a bit more. But worth the money compared, to after mat.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  No harsh or chemical smell, and customer service was great.&lt;br /&gt;Worth trying for sure!!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Using in combination with Terrasil.</li>
            <li> This soap works great in calming down irritants. I would highly recommend this product for the terrible jock itch that troubles people in the hot weather.</li>
            <li> Relieves the itching; skin feels good</li>
            <li> soothing and love the smell...easy to use  effective ..very nice product..I will be keeping it on hand</li>
            <li> This wash is wonderful!  After doing some research, I read that tea tree oil is really good for the skin. So when I saw this I thought it would be worth a try. This stuff smells so good! I love it! Not only did it clear up the problem, but my feet were so soft and smooth! The tea tree oil and mint are so refreshing.Will definitely keep buying this product.</li>
            <li> Daily use seems to keep fungus at bay but does not get rid of it. The scent is acceptable as well.</li>
            <li> I went through many ointments, and nothing could help clear up my jock itch. Finally I found something that soothed and healed on the spot. My discomfort and irritability was taken away in just a few days. I highly recommend this product. I even used it  on my athletes feet and it worked wonders. A must have product!!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a difference. Thx</li>
            <li> Product arrived in a timely manner. It works very well for my needs. Thank you for making it available.</li>
            <li> Love this product and service is excellent!</li>
            <li> Great product, thank you!</li>
            <li> I have a skin fungal infections on my legs, arms, chest, and neck areas that just does not seem to clear up.  I been using clotrimazole, but that does not help much and i am concerned that it is causing the fungal infection to become stronger.  Funga-Free actually makes my skin feel better and I do not itch as much.  However, I believe it is only a temporary relief product.  I am still using the product and maybe will have a different opinion afterwards, but as of right now I recommend it.</li>
            <li> So originally I was kind of skeptical, but based on the reviews I decided to try this out. I have had a rash on my calves for quite some time now and haven&#x27;t been sure what it is. So decided to try the body wash which I came across from searching for possible causes. I can happily say that the rash has diminished quite a bit visibly and definitely doesn&#x27;t itch as much as it used to after using the body wash for about a week now.</li>
            <li> I do love this product! I added it to my pedicure regime...So I treat my feet at least once a month. Mountainbreeze is also very diligent about Customer Service...a big 5 star rating there as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a new happy believer of Funga-free body wash. I will be ordering more soon!! Thank you</li>
            <li> Took a bit but it work.</li>
            <li> This antifungal soap is the best I&#x27;ve tried.  I have been suffering with an itchy rash on my lower legs and didn&#x27;t wear shorts because of the way it looked.  After only two times of using Mountain Breeze antifungal soap I am wearing shorts and I&#x27;m rash free.  This stuff is amazing and I will recommend it to anyone with skin issues.</li>
            <li> This product is &amp;#34;wonderful!&amp;#34; I originally purchased it for my mom&#x27;s feet, she is bedridden and require special care, attention-and the appropriate healthcare products. I found this product to be a great and refreshing addition to her personal care needs collection. It has the clean, crisp scent of peppermint that leaves you feeling smooth, fresh and energized. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Relieves my itchy legs, which is huge relief! Natural ingredients, smells good &amp; husband likes using it too :)</li>
            <li> Put this in a hand soap dispenser and love the cleaning action, the mint and tea tree smell.  Along with oregano oil I am seeing great results!</li>
            <li> this product is very good. It does what it says it will do. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> So, I swear when I work out... A lot. Antifungal soap was recommended to me by a friend to help with my feet stop itching and feeling funny after the gym. I tried this soap for the first time yesterday and I must say I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised as I was a bit skeptical before. It works great and makes my feet feel awesome. I would recommend this absolutely.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been hitting the gym more and more trying to keep my new years resolution and as much as i hate to admit it, my feet have been a lil swampy and have a bit more funk than usual. i&#x27;ve tried antibacterial soap and some sprays but it wasn&#x27;t cutting it.  the smell is great, the product not too medicinal smelly or girly, just a nice balanced soap that helps with the swamp feet / funky odors coming from my feet and sneakers.  I leave it in the shower and have sometimes put it on my whole body after a particularly sweaty day. works amazing and doesn&#x27;t smell as manly as some other antibacterial soaps.</li>
            <li> I have really sweaty feet from playing basketball and working out and was recommended this soap by a friend at the gym. This has been working very well i instantly was relieved almost with a cooling feel and it prevented it from coming back after a few uses. Definitely would recommend.</li>
            <li> My husband feet gets very sweaty through year and specially summer is quite hard with smells as well.  Sorry for him that it is natuare of his body but I get some painful consequences, I am super sensitive with smell/odor and I had to dea with it all the time.  Also he has athlatic foot, has been there for a long time now.&lt;br /&gt;I read the product description and reviews then why not trying this natural ingredient which is oretty straight forward and nothing chemical behind it.  So I ordered it for him. He has been using it for a month now and he never been so consistant using a product but this.  Because he sees his athletic foot has been getting better!  And ZERO odor for this sweaty summer day!  And I will update as more moths goes by.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! This is a MUST if you live in a humid climate. I love how it makes my skin look and feel without drying it out. I will continue using this product!</li>
            <li> Smells great, leaves feet feeling clean and refreshed.  Received as promised.</li>
            <li> This soap works as advertised, I have have athlete&#x27;s foot and have tried several other products.Mountain Breeze works well with the medicine the doctor gave me and makes my feel great, It smells great and is an economical way to take care of an annoying problem. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to pamper their feet.</li>
            <li> I go to the gym A LOT. So I&#x27;ve developed a foot fungus problem that pops up rather often. I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of methods to help and none of them can even compare to this. The fungi on my feet were gone in just a few washes, and my feet smell great now! No more smelly feet and shoes, or fungus. I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone with a fungal problem!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this product in the mail! It shipped fast, came in great packaging, and the bottle is a great size. I think it&#x27;s wonderful that this product is all natural, so it really does help with dry skin and itchiness. Also, I like that it&#x27;s all natural because it ensures I&#x27;m not putting any harsh chemicals on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;  I have relatively dry hands (they&#x27;re not painfully dry, but still dry enough) during the winter, and when I used this product to wash them I noticed a huge difference. First of all, my skin was pink and very clean looking. Second of all, my pores has opened to the point where I could see them, and my skin was smooth and supple. Third, my hands were tingling (in a good way). They just felt clean! Oh, and this stuff smells great, too. Needless to say, I am very happy with the overall quality of this product, and will certainly be using this in the future. Softball season is just around the corner for me, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll have plenty of opportunities to use it then</li>
            <li> Our son walks everywhere, and with it being so wet out, he wound up with athlete’s foot. Sprays were horrible. The first one burned his feet, and the second one was expensive, only worked for a few minutes and really stunk. My wife found this looking for natural alternatives. We wanted something that smelled okay without smelling girlie and did a better job of stopping the itching. So far, this is working great.</li>
            <li> donsnt work on fungal infec. smell awsome thats why im not that upset. doe not do anything just like all other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; rip u off products. It does smell really nice thoe. Wont be buying again</li>
            <li> I like this body wash so much that only after using 3 times I have ordered 2 more bottles.  Customer service is excellent, and it feels good to use a natural product with visible benefits.  I used it on my face after liking the results on my body - hesitantly, because to look at, my face doesn&#x27;t look bad, but I had some under the surface things going on.  I didn&#x27;t want a reaction or anything that would take an ok situation and turn it to bad, but I&#x27;m happy to report that I saw improvement after 2 uses.  My skin feels overall cleaner and tingly fresh when I use this product and it does not have a medicinal smell - it just smells and feels fresh at the end.  I have sensitive skin and I had no reactions...this is exactly what I was hoping for - something natural for everyday use that would prevent and clear up minor skin issues.</li>
            <li> Great product, it can be used head to toe.  Nice clean scent, I find it very effective especially if you work out, to keep your body itch free and fresh.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t feel the itch as much.  Clean minty smell and body doesn&#x27;t feel dry.  The only negative is the price for such a small bottle!!</li>
            <li> I have ordered from Amazon different Antifungal Soap products and this one is the best. The ingredients are all natural and without petroleum byproduct. It uses vegetable glycerin as smoothing agent and Rosemary Extract for preservative. Unlike other AS, this one does not leave a film on your skin after washing. I like the minty smell and cooling feeling too!</li>
            <li> great product.nice scent and good on the skin.</li>
            <li> Item received promptly.  It does seem to help reduce itching and a nice minty smell.  I think it&#x27;s over priced.</li>
            <li> I have not really had time to use and determine how the Antifungal Soap does for my use but as of now I really do like it and look forward to using it regularly.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this &#x27;pricey&#x27; purchase. This product helps to keep my mild/moderate seborrheic dermatitis under control as well leaving my skin feeling moisturised - all this and lovely scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s October 23, 2017. I&#x27;ve been ordering bottles of these since May 2015. Helga always gets in-contact to make sure you are satisfied. She really does work hard. I am pleased with the product and the customer service. Thanks Helga. This wash always makes you smell minty clean - great ingredients. 5 stars.  :)</li>
            <li> My feet dig this stuff. My feet is relieved of dry itchy skin and makes my feet feel good. Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This is very good to the skin leaves it nice and soft. Will order it again.</li>
            <li> I have used trader joes tea tree tingle body wash for a while. I thought this would be better. Compared side by side and there is no discernible difference other than price.</li>
            <li> I just love this product! It started healing in just two days. I will be getting this as long as needed. It didn&#x27;t burn, felt good, smelt good. Thank you from the bottom of my feet.</li>
            <li> This feels great on my feet</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if this actually works because I used it in tandem with OTC medication. But, if you&#x27;re using it for jock itch, I will say this: it is like a York Peppermint Patty for your crotch! You can practically hear the brisk mountain breeze whistling between your legs! I like it, and it smells nice.</li>
            <li> Weird feel to it. After getting used to that I use it everyday in my shower.  I had some spots on my skin that may have been fungal that are going away after a couple of uses. The smell is pepper-minty tea tree. I take my normal shower but plug the tub so my feet are soaking, my feet are softer. Also my feet don&#x27;t itch since using this (athletes foot).</li>
            <li> I assumed this was more crunchy people crap that did nothing. I used it twice a day and it worked within three days. Its excellent. Got rid of the irritation. Cleared my skin. Smells good and has great foam lather. Going to use it for another week to be sure the rash is gone but I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using a prescription for a recurring problem. Don&#x27;t need the medical cream since I am using this soap.</li>
            <li> I have a stinky feet problem, especially in NY where i wear very warm shoes all day in which my feet sweat.  Since i started using this soap my feed smell much better! I am not scared to take my shoes off when i go to visit firends and family! This soap really helped me boost up my confidence and helped my feet feel and smell fresh!</li>
            <li> Good product and excellent contact from the seller. I originally bought this product to treat yeast infections that prescribed and OTC treatments were not successfully treating for very long. It has worked well for me and I&#x27;ve seen improvements quickly. I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> The tea tree oil feels great! I haven&#x27;t been using it for long, but it seems to be fairly effective! Dries out my skin a tiny bit, but all things considered, it was a good buy!!!</li>
            <li> Great product, it&#x27;s aost orgasmic to use since it really is a natural product…I would recommend this product to a friend who&#x27;s having problems with fungus or foot problems…</li>
            <li> We used it on our guinea pig that had some weird skin issues going on. It worked great! We bathed him for 2 weeks and noticed it working after just a couple of days. Very good product. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> feels and smells awesome!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with my skin condition for some time now and tried many things and nothing ever really worked. So I figured I&#x27;d try this out and so far it&#x27;s been amazing. I&#x27;m not itchy the flakes reduced. I couldn&#x27;t be more happier with this product.</li>
            <li> A luxuriously rich soft body wash, enhanced by fragrant botanicals and a tingling menthol sensation. Works wonders on problem skin care matters especially formulated to reduce the issues surrounding areas affected. Athletes feet, jock itch, ringworm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has been a helpful addition to these ongoing dilemmas alongside an antibacterial soap. Would highly recommend this for anyone who works out a lot, after-sports, to general clean up on hot, humid days. Very effective. Safe for all ages in my opinion.</li>
            <li> As an avid participant in both basketball and weight lifting, I have experience numerous cases of foot fungus that became quite bothersome at times. I decided to give this product a try and it made a world of a difference. My feet felt great and refreshed after each wash and noticed there was no longer buildup of fungus after first few uses. The peppermint fragrance was pleasant as well and an added bonus. I would recommend this product to athletes and active individuals of all ages not only as treatment for foot fungus, but as a general body wash as well. It&#x27;s a great and highly effective product at a great price!</li>
            <li> What I love most about this product is how versatile it is.&lt;br /&gt;I see from reading other reviews that a lot of people use it for sports related issues, such as athlete&#x27;s foot and other fungal infections. Obviously it works great for that, but it&#x27;s also wonderful for dry skin. I have a family member whose feet get terribly dry and itchy in winter, so after reading the ingredients on this stuff, I thought it might work well for that. Boy, was I right! Not only is his skin smooth and well hydrated after using this product, but he couldn&#x27;t get over how *clean* it left him feeling. He hates most moisturizers because they leave his feet feeling greasy, so to say this has been a welcome change would be an understatement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also like the clean, pleasant scent, and as other reviewers have said, it makes for a fantastic deodorizer. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This product really helped me out after applying the Antifungal Soap and Body Wash to both my feet while I was in the shower and within days the fungus that was visible was no longer a problem so it happened to work out perfectly and I would purchase this product again because it works wonders.</li>
            <li> This was an excellent product. It contains tea tree oil, a natural antifungal, antibacterial and antiviral. It works great on dry feet, leaving them moisturized and feeling refreshed. It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin and had a pleasant scent. It works to treat or prevent highly contagious fungal infections that includes athlete&#x27;s foot, ringworm and jock itch. A small price to pay for an effective preventative!</li>
            <li> I love to wear shoes without socks.  I’m also a gym rat.  Putting those things together can lead to…let’s just call it not the best smelling feet in the world.  This product has worked wonders in that area.  It leaves my feet feeling fresh and dry, and not greasy.  I also love that it is all natural ingredients.  Another benefit is the scent of this product.  It is pleasant without being overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line – give it a try.  There’s a 45 day money back guarantee so what do you have to lose really.</li>
            <li> Great product-it&#x27;s really helping me &amp; I&#x27;ve already purchased more-I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this to alleviate itchy winter feet.  So far it is doing the job and I will continue to use it year-round.  It has a nice fresh smell.  The customer service for this product is excellent - I got a follow up e-mail asking how I liked it and had a nice exchange with the co-founder.  They take care of their customers which is nice to see these days.</li>
            <li> YOU NEED THIS IN YOUR SHOWER!!!</li>
            <li> This antifungel soap was recommend to me as a wonderful soap to have in my bath cabnit for the family to use as needed.</li>
            <li> I have had a history of dry, scaly feet, as well as toe fungus that made my toenails thick &amp; yellow.  Not only does Funga-Free eliminate these problems for me, I love the cool feeling when it is applied to my feet.  Funga-Free goes on smoothly &amp; absorbs quickly, and it smells VERY nice.  I especially like to apply Funga-Free at bedtime, and then put on my favorite pair of soft socks.  This seems to enhance the healing effects of each application.</li>
            <li> Amazing Product!!  I purchased for my son who wrestles.  Perfect solution to use in shower to get rid of the nasty mat germs.</li>
            <li> I have a recurring fungal skin infection, and have used most other similar anti-fungal soap products on the market before...which sometimes helped to varying degrees. Funga-Free seems to do a much better job than those products that I&#x27;ve tried before. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong or unpleasant odor, or a gritty texture to it. It&#x27;s very smooth and lathers up quite easily to clean and refresh the area thoroughly. I can&#x27;t say that it has completely cleared up my fungal infection yet, but it has definitely controlled it from becoming any worse, and the itching and redness do seem to be greatly reduced. Good product and worth the money!</li>
            <li> This soap is great!  Makes you feel really clean.</li>
            <li> Works great and smells good.</li>
            <li> Great soap. Smells really good the entire day</li>
            <li> Soap works great. Good, prompt service.</li>
            <li> Hoping this is going to help our son!  He has tried everything to get rid of this fungus that has attached itself to his scalp.  He doesn&#x27;t want to shave his head if he doesn&#x27;t have to.  After reading all the great reviews we were sold on using this product!</li>
            <li> Best stuff for after a hard core work out. If you wanna get rid of fungal sweat and grime this is it. It&#x27;s very refreshing and cures jock itch and athletes feet. Make sure you use a pouf sponge and scrub good and a water filter for your shower wouldn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> I purchase this item to used after getting my nails done you only need just a drop to get great latter ,to soon to tell how good it is but think it does what it says</li>
            <li> I purchased this profuct for back acne. Have been using it for over 1 yr and the improvement on my skin is great i also just started using it on my face and so far does not dry my skin. Only thing, i wish it would lather a little more.</li>
            <li> We love this product and Mountainbreeze Natural people who are so helpful.  It has become a main stay supply for our household!</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I went to another doctor who told me what I had was not jock itch. This could be the reason why it did not work for me. Prescription ointments did the trick for my problem.  I bought this for Jock Itch. It didn&#x27;t work for me. It only temporarily relieved the itching.</li>
            <li> Works great, nice mint smell and tingling sensation. My daughter uses it for a skin fongus along with Tea Tree Oil that she gets every summer.. It really works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this body wash for almost a month. I wasn&#x27;t happy about the price but as they say, you get what you pay for. I purchased this for body acne, not fungus. I&#x27;ve tried many of the cheaper salicylic acid body washes and this has been the most effective. I&#x27;m trying to listen to customer service and not use as much to keep it economical. I responded to Helga&#x27;s email and got an additional 10% off on the next order. Very nice unobtrusive scent as well.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working great for my son. Bought 2 bottles to be on the safe side but don&#x27;t think he will need it. Will put away in case he has a breakout again</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product , so pleased that I ordered 2 more.</li>
            <li> So far so good from someone who is constantly battling a fungus issue of some kind. I feel clean and fresh always. Love this wash! I travel a lot and take it with me everywhere.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love to bicycle for miles. Cycling is great exercise and lots of fun. Unfortunately my husband&#x27;s persistent jock itch has been a hindrance lately. He&#x27;s tried the sprays you buy at the drugstore but he only gets a few days of relief before it returns. We decided to try something else, something natural, that he can use on a more consistent basis without risking his health. Right off the bat he noticed a difference. Relief from the itch. That right there makes it worth the price we paid. And, as a bonus, this product has a pleasant minty smell. It doesn&#x27;t stink like medicine. And it can be used for a variety of other issues, like my dry skin and our teenager&#x27;s smelly feet. As far as customer service, I really appreciated the follow up email sent by the seller after we purchased, and the 45 day money back guarantee. There aren&#x27;t many companies these days that seem so determined to please their customers.  Most definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> Wow it had a freshing smell which I like. I just started to use this &amp; again I am satisfied with my purchase.  Use just a little foams fast. My girlfriend will be ordering this item. Word if mouth makes a diffetence</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT FOR DRY SKIN</li>
