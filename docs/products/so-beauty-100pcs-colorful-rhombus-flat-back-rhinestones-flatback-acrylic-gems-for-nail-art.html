            <li> Once silver backing is damaged its just clear no shine.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t overwhelm your hands, if you have long nails</li>
            <li> A little big on the nail.</li>
            <li> these are extremely shinny !!</li>
            <li> Beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Colorful&lt;br /&gt;Great for nails or small crafts</li>
            <li> they still had plastic burrs on them so putting it on your nails is not really a good idea as they can snag onto something</li>
            <li> Very hard to keep in place if used by itself.</li>
            <li> Poor shine on rhinestones.</li>
