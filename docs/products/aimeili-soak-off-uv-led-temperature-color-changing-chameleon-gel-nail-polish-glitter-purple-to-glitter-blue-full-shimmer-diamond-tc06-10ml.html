            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This nail polish is amazing .</li>
            <li>Colors are bright and color change is true to color!</li>
            <li>Very true to picture color!</li>
            <li>I bought this, along with another brand of color changing gel polish, and I really love the color of this.  </li>
            <li>I love it, but the glitter doesn&#x27;t sparkle.</li>
            <li>It gives it a more stars in the sky feel.</li>
            <li>and we love it</li>
            <li>I did 2 minutes per coat to be safe.</li>
            <li>I love my colors</li>
            <li>Love product and color.</li>
            <li>This changes quickly and is a nice combination .</li>
            <li>Amazing color, quick color changes.</li>
            <li>Otherwise looks great after a week so far.</li>
            <li>The color change effect is great and the blue (when warm) is really nice, kind of like an ocean carribean blue.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about this, but it looked cool and was cheap.</li>
            <li>The color was peeling off prematurely and she received a free manicure, but we lost money and she lost time.</li>
            <li>I needed uv light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only been about 3 days of wear, but so far so good, color change still perfect after really testing it with lots of handwashing.</li>
            <li>This Temperature color changing nail polish is fun!  </li>
            <li>But this is a fun color!</li>
            <li>My clients are having so much fun with these!</li>
            <li>The blue is gorgeous and the purple is just as alluring .</li>
            <li>Love the color changes - really works well.</li>
            <li>The color shown is pretty accurate.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty</li>
            <li>Super pretty!</li>
            <li>This color is nice in the blue shade.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because the color change is not that noticeable and rarely occurs.</li>
            <li>It took it a while to get here (US) from overseas, but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>These are my new favorite as a professional Nail Stylist!</li>
            <li>Took FOREVER to arrive and really stinky, fun colors, though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to a friend :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so pretty.</li>
            <li>Barring really rough use or accidents that damage the nail itself, the polish tends to last no less than two weeks, and the color changing with heat is just awesome!</li>
            <li>These gel polishes are great because you have to use the UV light to &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; them, and they last at least a week on me.</li>
            <li>Polish seems to be very globby even for it to have glitter in it.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s really something you have to see for yourself.</li>
            <li>I spent 2 hours trying to remove the polish and still wasn&#x27;t able to get it all off.</li>
            <li>Looked cool but doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>It changes pink when you are warm and in between warm and cold it turns blue on the tips and purple at the top.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to stand up as well as the other brand, or change colors as easily, but it does work</li>
            <li>Love the colors, only thing I didn&#x27;t like was there were no instructions on how long to cure.</li>
            <li>mainly bought these because I&#x27;m a nail biter, and regular polish tends to peel off within hours or a day of putting on.  </li>
            <li>Ga. I received this product and noticed it was way too thick, viscous, to be able to be applied properly without thinning.</li>
            <li>if you have long nails that extend past th nail bed, then you get the cold color (purple) on the tips and a striking bright blue on the bed.</li>
            <li>The color on my ring finger is Hot Pink to Glitter White.  </li>

            <li> The color on my ring finger is Hot Pink to Glitter White.  </li>
            <li> I use a different prep and topcoat than AIMEILI, and it works quit well and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> The nail polish goes on fairly easily, just have to mind the sparkles can clump at times, but once you get used to the consistency, it is not too difficult to get an event coat.</li>
            <li> Well, as predicted, the customer that requested the color came back a few days later.</li>
            <li> really thick and only last for 2-4 days....</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even use this polish because it was thick and obviously looked like it&#x27;s been sitting abound not sealed properly.</li>
            <li> Used Red Carpet base and top coats.  </li>
            <li> Color changes from blue when hot to purple when cold.</li>
            <li> I have bought other color changing polishes that have not worked .</li>
            <li> She is amazed at the color changing due to temperature.</li>
            <li> It is cool, however, it stays the lighter color when on nails, only goes the real color when hands are in cold water or cold air.</li>
            <li> Had to use a dark color polish to cover my nails so that the remaining polish didn&#x27;t show.</li>
            <li> I try to use new products because even though it is O.K. to thin products properly, this one was way to thick and needed excessive amounts of thinner.</li>
            <li> A really fun product to wear on your nails BUT impossible to remove.</li>
            <li> I will admit, I was a bit skeptical when I was first applying it cause it seemed on the thick side</li>
            <li> Got a couple small chips in it, but that may have been due to cleaning the house.  </li>
            <li> (The blue tone is for heat and the purple is for cold.)</li>
            <li> I know never to use acetone to thin polish, lacquer, or  gel.</li>
            <li> When really cold its a darker purple.</li>

            <li> Took FOREVER to arrive and really stinky, fun colors, though.</li>
            <li> This Temperature color changing nail polish is fun!  It is gel - so needs to be prepared properly.  Since the blue and purple are close in color range - sometimes the color change isn&#x27;t as noticeable as the pink/white combination that I also ordered.  But this is a fun color!</li>
            <li> really thick and only last for 2-4 days....</li>
            <li> Great product! Shipping arrived 3 weeks earlier than estimated delivery. Color changes from blue when hot to purple when cold. The color on my ring finger is Hot Pink to Glitter White.  ***UPDATE***This product chipped off the very next day. Looked cool but doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I love it, but the glitter doesn&#x27;t sparkle. It gives it a more stars in the sky feel.</li>
            <li> I buy nail colors for a spa in Atlanta, Ga. I received this product and noticed it was way too thick, viscous, to be able to be applied properly without thinning. I know never to use acetone to thin polish, lacquer, or  gel. I wrote the company and told them I was concerned about issues with the product. I also told them it had sat outside in the heat for a while. I try to use new products because even though it is O.K. to thin products properly, this one was way to thick and needed excessive amounts of thinner. This compromises the product. (You know, follow the directions on the back)? I wrote them and told them and they didn&#x27;t read my email properly and told me to try to use acetone or a thinner even though I didn&#x27;t like to use them. I have a chemistry degree. I use what I need to, and how it&#x27;s suppose to. Well, as predicted, the customer that requested the color came back a few days later. The color was peeling off prematurely and she received a free manicure, but we lost money and she lost time. They told me just to &amp;#34;wait on the review.&amp;#34; Here&#x27;s your review.</li>
            <li> This color is nice in the blue shade. I gave it 4 stars because the color change is not that noticeable and rarely occurs.</li>
            <li> I love this polish! Pictures don&#x27;t do the gradient justice, it&#x27;s really something you have to see for yourself. I will admit, I was a bit skeptical when I was first applying it cause it seemed on the thick side but it came out beautiful. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to a friend :)</li>
            <li> Got this and a different color and we love it I do my nails at home couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even use this polish because it was thick and obviously looked like it&#x27;s been sitting abound not sealed properly.</li>
            <li> reminds me of the sky.  Very pretty</li>
            <li> Love this gel nail polish! It&#x27;s so pretty. Very true to picture color!</li>
            <li> Love the colors, only thing I didn&#x27;t like was there were no instructions on how long to cure. I did 2 minutes per coat to be safe.</li>
            <li> I love my colors however was unaware I needed uv light.</li>
            <li> These are my new favorite as a professional Nail Stylist! My clients are having so much fun with these! Colors are bright and color change is true to color!</li>
            <li> A really fun product to wear on your nails BUT impossible to remove. I spent 2 hours trying to remove the polish and still wasn&#x27;t able to get it all off. Had to use a dark color polish to cover my nails so that the remaining polish didn&#x27;t show.</li>
            <li> If you like attention, this is your polish. Its an attention grabber. A conversation nail polish. It changes pink when you are warm and in between warm and cold it turns blue on the tips and purple at the top. When really cold its a darker purple. All these colors have sparkles in the nail polish. Great anywhere. You can go from work to play.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is amazing . I have bought other color changing polishes that have not worked . This changes quickly and is a nice combination . The blue is gorgeous and the purple is just as alluring . I have had a lot of compliments on this nail polish .</li>
            <li> It is cool, however, it stays the lighter color when on nails, only goes the real color when hands are in cold water or cold air. Not what I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> It took it a while to get here (US) from overseas, but it was worth the wait. The nail polish goes on fairly easily, just have to mind the sparkles can clump at times, but once you get used to the consistency, it is not too difficult to get an event coat. I use a different prep and topcoat than AIMEILI, and it works quit well and lasts for a long time.

(The blue tone is for heat and the purple is for cold.)</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife for Christmas. She loves nail polishes. She is amazed at the color changing due to temperature.</li>
            <li> Amazing color, quick color changes. Love it!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this, but it looked cool and was cheap. I love this polish! Excellent color change. Really beautiful if you have long nails that extend past th nail bed, then you get the cold color (purple) on the tips and a striking bright blue on the bed. It&#x27;s only been about 3 days of wear, but so far so good, color change still perfect after really testing it with lots of handwashing.</li>
            <li> The color change effect is great and the blue (when warm) is really nice, kind of like an ocean carribean blue.  The color shown is pretty accurate.  Took about 3-4 coats to get an opaque coverage.  Used Red Carpet base and top coats.  Got a couple small chips in it, but that may have been due to cleaning the house.  Otherwise looks great after a week so far.</li>
            <li> Love it! Super pretty!</li>
            <li> Love the color changes - really works well.</li>
            <li> Love product and color.</li>
