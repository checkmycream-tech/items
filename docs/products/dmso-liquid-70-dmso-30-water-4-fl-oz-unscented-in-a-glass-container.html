            <li>When I tried to print a return label I could not, because Amazon does not allow return of HAZARDOUS MATERIALS.</li>
            <li>Many thanks for a wonderful product.</li>

            <li>Great, fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic!</li>
            <li>Love the glass bottle - much more stable storage.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>and I sincerely wish I had not opened it.&lt;br /&gt;I called the company and was told that they order it in 55 gallon containers</li>
            <li>My mom uses it and it takes some of her pain away in most of the cases.</li>
            <li>MOST OF THE TIME</li>
            <li>it is very clean</li>
            <li>So use it after a shower on clean skin!</li>
            <li>Application of this product( a solvent as on the label)  is easy and does reduce my pain for about 4-5 hours.</li>
            <li>Dmso always works for me and this one does not have a strong garlic smell or taste.</li>
            <li>and it has help tremendously!  </li>
            <li>I actually have tried many, many products that claim to be oif great benefit but DMSO really works almost immediately.</li>
            <li>Amazing how my joint injuries heal so much faster by rubbing DMSO on affected area.  </li>
            <li>It was recomended to me many years ago by a former employer, who found a good result with this product.  </li>
            <li>One good source is the company started by the medical Doctor that helped so many patients with DMSO therapy - Dr. Stanley Jacob.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s essential to wash your hands of any residue.&lt;br /&gt;DMSO is very powerful but amazingly effective for acute arthritic pain.</li>
            <li>If it is not diluted it will burn your skin, as this is a very powerful pain reliever.</li>
            <li>Their are a lot of things I don&#x27;t like about DMSO in general, but it is wonderful for pain and helps my arnica gel to be absorbed more deeply.</li>
            <li>The good news is that real Medical Grade (or Laboratory Grade) DMSO is readily available.</li>
            <li>the pure dmso may be better  </li>
            <li>At the top of the label it says 99.9% Pure DMSO.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this product, it has helped with so much.</li>
            <li>I have used it for years to help heal various injuries, always with good results.  </li>
            <li>I love mixing the dmso with my essential oils and makes them work even better really like this company and love how it is in a glass bottle</li>
            <li>While I cannot say it is 100% without odor, it is a GREAT improvement over any other I&#x27;ve ever used or smelled.</li>
            <li>I have read that DMSO penetrates body tissue so quickly that one immediately experiences a garlic taste in the mouth.</li>
            <li>It was easy, painfree, and fast.</li>
            <li>It works wonders, and I can vouch that this particular manufacturer provides a very pure and safe DMSO.</li>
            <li>A Glass container is important for storage, since DMSO stored in plastic bottles (certain types of plastic) may leach chemicals into the DMSO contaminating it.  </li>
            <li>Dilute to 50-70% and it is useful for a variety of applications.</li>
            <li>because it absorbs whatever is on your skin, just be careful and use wisely.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not even worth it.</li>
            <li>This 70% solution is made to use right out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I used this solution right out of the bottle with no mixing.  </li>
            <li>you could taste it right away, this you don&#x27;t  </li>
            <li>it is a mix , then it should be shown right up front.</li>
            <li>Like many past good products, manufacturers change things usually to save a buck and ruin what was a perfectly good product.  </li>
            <li>I just wanted to pass along the information on the bottle that may be helpful to someone interested in purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>DSMO works better than any over the counter product for my arthritic hands and back.</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t exactly what i thought....</li>
            <li>They know exactly what they are doing, especially with the cute tree logo and the fact that they market to health food stores.  </li>
            <li>I wanted DMSO for my first aid kit.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>From other articles I&#x27;ve read, these warnings seem to be mainly for legal reasons, but it was surprising to me to see these warnings when I read them on the bottle.</li>
            <li>Not messy and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>The label says that the DMSO portion of the bottle is 99.9% pure, and that the bottle contains 70% DMSO and 30% distilled water.</li>
            <li>If you buy a 99.9% pure version (not diluted), you will need to dilute it by 30-50% with distilled water before applying it to your skin.  </li>
            <li>was floored to find that 1/3 of it was pure</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Pure DMSO and distilled water in a 75% DMSO to 25% H2O mix\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>This DMSO is advertised as pure, when in fact, pure DMSO is normally considered 99.9% (or higher)</li>
            <li>For me, the word PURE means 100% or very close to it....</li>
            <li>I really like this brand and have had no reactions with it.  </li>
            <li>This really works on aches and pains</li>
            <li>Dr. Jacob is retired now, but devoted much of his life to the study of this product.  </li>
            <li>which didn&#x27;t really help.  </li>
            <li>I tried Cortisone injections and didn&#x27;t give me much relief, then I tried this.  </li>
            <li>Be careful and don&#x27;t use with lotions and be sure where ever you put this</li>
            <li>I am very please with this product.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Have been singing Its praises the whole time.</li>
            <li>DMSO is the best kept secret in the medical industry.</li>
            <li>However, once the product is received the label clearly states that it should be used as a solvent only, that it may cause skin irritation, and that it is unlawful to suggest that the product is safe for medicinal use.</li>
            <li>Cost effective way to get high quality DMSO for internal or external use.</li>
            <li>However, opening a new bottle today of this DMSO product, I was met with a very plastic acrylic industrial odor.  </li>
            <li>but sure helps me function with less pain.  </li>
            <li>High Quality DMSO.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also taken to using it on an old shoulder injury that is, at times, absolutely excruciating.</li>
            <li>So I have moved it to my garage and will visit my local holistic pharmacy for medicinal grade DMSO at twice the cost, but it will be worth it.</li>
            <li>I feel that I did get modest relief of joint pain in my fingers, but certainly nothing miraculous or complete.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the long term effects of this product will be, but it&#x27;s worth almost anything for the relief it brought my husband.  </li>
            <li>Not to say it won&#x27;t burn like a mother if you get it in a recent skin abrasion or cut, but I was up and running again pain-free inside three days after the first application (I applied it vigorously over that duration).</li>
            <li>was so excited to order and receive this DMSO because of the rave reviews from other people.</li>
            <li>They completely misrepresent the product!</li>
            <li>This glass bottle is actually a 70% DMSO solution of 99.9% pure DMSO with 30% distilled water.  </li>
            <li>It costs twice as much for the same quanity</li>
            <li>and it was a complete bust.</li>
            <li>Stay away from this vendor, as they completely misrepresent what they sell.</li>
            <li>The only pure medical grade DMSO I have found is from Jacob Lab.  </li>
            <li>My wife called them to ask what grade this is, since it isn&#x27;t marked on the container, and they said that the bottle is marked as not for human use, and that it is Industrial grade that they buy in 55 gallon containers.</li>
            <li>My husband injured his shoulder and could barely lift his arm \, i applied DMSO to it and he felt a difference that day  </li>
            <li>Considering most pain relief medicine has significant risk of negative side effects such as liver damgage, especially when used long term, it seems unlikely to me that DMSO is worse than most of the approved pain medicines.</li>

            <li> certainly not diluted to 70% with distilled water.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Also works for sore muscles, and any number of other things.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work for what i bought it for ;(((</li>
            <li> Never bandage the area where DMSO is applied. Always thoroughly wash and dry the area to be treated. Use piece of a cotton ball to apply it and what is not absorbed I pat dry with the remainder of the cotton ball. It&#x27;s essential to wash your hands of any residue.&lt;br /&gt;DMSO is very powerful but amazingly effective for acute arthritic pain. It definitely works for me.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is the difficulty of use.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to be unfair to the product, so I gave it 5 stars, but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet. I just wanted to pass along the information on the bottle that may be helpful to someone interested in purchasing this product. The label doesn&#x27;t mention anything about whether or not it is industrial, medical or laboratory grade. The label says that the DMSO portion of the bottle is 99.9% pure, and that the bottle contains 70% DMSO and 30% distilled water. From what I understand, DSMO is not approved for sale to the public for medical use, so the bottle has a variety of warnings about avoiding contact with the skin, and not for human use. From other articles I&#x27;ve read, these warnings seem to be mainly for legal reasons, but it was surprising to me to see these warnings when I read them on the bottle. I haven&#x27;t read about any major negative side effects from the people who use DMSO for pain relief, so it is puzzling to me why it hasn&#x27;t been approved for medical use. Considering most pain relief medicine has significant risk of negative side effects such as liver damgage, especially when used long term, it seems unlikely to me that DMSO is worse than most of the approved pain medicines.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a miracle cure.  You may need to add a tablespoon of water so that it does not burn.</li>
            <li> A good product..not a cure all..but sure helps me function with less pain.  FDA should wake up..God Bless the Health food Stores. AAA+++</li>
            <li> I really like this brand and have had no reactions with it.  Will continue to be my choice. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> This really works on aches and pains</li>
            <li> Used for bursitus in Knee - worked great</li>
            <li> the pure dmso may be better  but this is good to put on at nite</li>
            <li> The only pure medical grade DMSO I have found is from Jacob Lab.  Dr. Jacob is retired now, but devoted much of his life to the study of this product.  It costs twice as much for the same quanity but you know what you are getting.  When Amazon starts selling it, I will get from Amazon but for now I will keep getting from Jacob Lab as I can trust what it is and what it will do which is amazing...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the long term effects of this product will be, but it&#x27;s worth almost anything for the relief it brought my husband.  He had severe shoulder pain from driving for long periods of time and a lower back ache. He had these problems for years and all the Dr. did was give him pain meds. which didn&#x27;t really help.  Both pains have disappeared since using the DMSO.  I think next time I might try the gel though. if I can find the gel in a glass jar. The liquid  is a bit messy when pouring it on,  Personally , I would only use the product if it were in a glass container tho, from what I read it&#x27;s not safe in plastic.</li>
            <li> I loved this product. I had Frozen Shoulder on both sides. I tried Cortisone injections and didn&#x27;t give me much relief, then I tried this.  I swear by this stuff !!</li>
            <li> Have used this product before, and use it topically for injuries, like sprains.</li>
            <li> It relieves the arthritis pain in my hands by rubbing it in.</li>
            <li> Almost instant pain relief for arthritis. DSMO works better than any over the counter product for my arthritic hands and back.</li>
            <li> Bought for husband---he used it not often---did not work that great---probably not order again.</li>
            <li> Instead of a shot at the Doctor&#x27;s office, I used the DMSO, and all the pain in my shoulder is gone! Absolutely fantastic!</li>
            <li> I wish I had. It&#x27;s a disappointing purchase. When I contacted the seller, I got a one-sentence reply that told me they don&#x27;t know what they are selling.&lt;br /&gt;I basically don&#x27;t know what I bought. The only outcome is; they got my money and I have two bottles to empty and recycle.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this product does all that people say, but I used it on muscle and the pain disappeared immediately.  There is definitely some benefit in it.</li>
            <li> High Quality DMSO. It is great for aches and pains and combating inflammation. Dilute to 50-70% and it is useful for a variety of applications.</li>
            <li> Their are a lot of things I don&#x27;t like about DMSO in general, but it is wonderful for pain and helps my arnica gel to be absorbed more deeply. This one is the nicest I&#x27;ve ever seen. While I cannot say it is 100% without odor, it is a GREAT improvement over any other I&#x27;ve ever used or smelled. I recommend it over any other brand of DMSO for your external pain usage.</li>
            <li> Instant temporary pain relief. Not messy and dries quickly. No after odors during the day and gives me&lt;br /&gt;more knee mobility.</li>
            <li> After personally testing this solution, I can attest that it is absolutely NOT as advertised. Do not be misled into ordering this crap.... Aarrrgggghhhhh!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product, have been using it for years!</li>
            <li> Love the glass bottle - much more stable storage. DMSO is the best kept secret in the medical industry. I use this regularly.</li>
            <li> I purchased a second bottle on DMSO from the same seller.  This product has definitely helped my hip pain.  It was recomended to me many years ago by a former employer, who found a good result with this product.  It is amazing and, for me, truly helped lessen the pain.  Relief isn&#x27;t instantaneous, but over a course of days, I felt the pain diminish.  Many thanks for a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> This DMSO is advertised as pure, when in fact, pure DMSO is normally considered 99.9% (or higher) DMSO with no dilution.  This glass bottle is actually a 70% DMSO solution of 99.9% pure DMSO with 30% distilled water.  If you buy a 99.9% pure version (not diluted), you will need to dilute it by 30-50% with distilled water before applying it to your skin.  Otherwise, it will burn your skin. This 70% solution is made to use right out of the bottle.  It still may require some additional dilution with distilled water if your skin becomes irritated with application of this 70% solution.  A Glass container is important for storage, since DMSO stored in plastic bottles (certain types of plastic) may leach chemicals into the DMSO contaminating it.  I used this solution right out of the bottle with no mixing.  My order was shipped and received promptly.</li>
            <li> My dad used to use DMSO for his knees, so we will see.</li>
            <li> not real sure of this ones use....wasn&#x27;t exactly what i thought....but that was my error not theirs....bottle doesn&#x27;t give directions</li>
            <li> Cost effective way to get high quality DMSO for internal or external use.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and works great for aches and pains. Other reviewers gave this a bad review because it is diluted, you want this product diluted. If it is not diluted it will burn your skin, as this is a very powerful pain reliever. I like that this product is sold in glass, as you NEVER want to buy DMSO in plastic because it absorbs anything it comes into contact with. So use it after a shower on clean skin! I would get this if nothing else has worked for your pains.</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL WHEN PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT UNLESS YOU ARE CLEANING WITH IT AND NOT CONSUMING IT. I repeat it is not for consumption, but they don&#x27;t tell you that when you call to question it. They say they don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> DMSO stops pain, pimples, soreness, and I keep it close at hand so that when pain or soreness comes, I zap it away !!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product, it has helped with so much. I got the unbelievers hooked on this product! When I was growing up I delt with warts, they just covered my legs and I would go to the doctor for multiple treatments trying to freeze or burn them off. With so many it was just too painful and took too long. A friend told me about DMSO so I gave it a try. I would file the wart and then apply the DMSO a couple times a day, and in a month my warts were gone! And they have not come back! It was easy, painfree, and fast. Now I can wear shorts and skirts! This stuff is amazing!!! The only downfall on this product that I noticed is that it leaves an odd taste in your mouth, like cod oil. But still a great product!</li>
            <li> DMSO is wonderful stuff, and has many therapeutic uses. I have used it for years to help heal various injuries, always with good results.  However, only MEDICAL GRADE or LABORATORY GRADE DMSO should ever be used for this purpose. This company is truly criminal - they are buying INDUSTRIAL GRADE DMSO in bulk and then marketing it for personal-care use. Industrial grade DMSO has dangerous contaminants in it like Acetone.  My wife called them to ask what grade this is, since it isn&#x27;t marked on the container, and they said that the bottle is marked as not for human use, and that it is Industrial grade that they buy in 55 gallon containers. They know exactly what they are doing, especially with the cute tree logo and the fact that they market to health food stores.  The good news is that real Medical Grade (or Laboratory Grade) DMSO is readily available. One good source is the company started by the medical Doctor that helped so many patients with DMSO therapy - Dr. Stanley Jacob. His website is jacoblab.com.  Cheers</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT THE DMSO I USED IN Washington State.. it&#x27;s a fraud!</li>
            <li> it is a great product</li>
            <li> Love this. Came quickly and the company is great.</li>
            <li> I received a 4 ounce bottle. At the top of the label it says 99.9% Pure DMSO. However the bottom of the label says 70% DMSO and 30% Distilled Water. I think this is misleading. For me, the word PURE means 100% or very close to it.... certainly not diluted to 70% with distilled water. I have read that DMSO penetrates body tissue so quickly that one immediately experiences a garlic taste in the mouth. This product doesn&#x27;t do that for me. I don&#x27;t know why. I feel that I did get modest relief of joint pain in my fingers, but certainly nothing miraculous or complete. (Purchased from Amazon.)</li>
            <li> I bought this a while back when I sprained my knee skateboarding. For a couple weeks I was totally unable to do anything physically strenuous (a.k.a. fun), and was getting tired of staring at my wall in boredom. A good friend and borderline holistic remedy expert turned me on to this wonderful stuff, and I can say that it&#x27;s entirely safe to use. Not to say it won&#x27;t burn like a mother if you get it in a recent skin abrasion or cut, but I was up and running again pain-free inside three days after the first application (I applied it vigorously over that duration). I&#x27;ve also taken to using it on an old shoulder injury that is, at times, absolutely excruciating. It works wonders, and I can vouch that this particular manufacturer provides a very pure and safe DMSO.</li>
            <li> Best dmso on market...a must to be packaged in glass bottle...</li>
            <li> I have lots of pain in my hands and feet.  It was suggested by a physician that I try this and it has help tremendously!  Be careful and don&#x27;t use with lotions and be sure where ever you put this it is very clean because it absorbs whatever is on your skin, just be careful and use wisely.  I was very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> It had some scary comments on the label - use as solvent only blah blah so I never got to try it.</li>
            <li> I am very please with this product.  I have ordered a third bottle for my hip pain.  I am convinced that I would not be doing this well if I had not tried DMSO.</li>
            <li> I received this product, described by the company on the Amazon website, as 99 percent pure.&lt;br /&gt;I was floored to find that 1/3 of it was pure water!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why, but it does not work for me at all and I sincerely wish I had not opened it.&lt;br /&gt;I called the company and was told that they order it in 55 gallon containers - then they add 30 percent water and put it in 4 ozs bottles. Sounds suspect to me! I would rather choose to add the distilled water myself - or not!!&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited to order and receive this DMSO because of the rave reviews from other people.I am always wary of those who complain. Here I am, complaining!!&lt;br /&gt;Does Amazon read these reviews and act on them? Just wondering.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product. I read a lot of hype about how great this was for pain in your joints and all that and it was a complete bust. The only thing is the price isn&#x27;t bad so I don&#x27;t feel as if I got screwed that bad.</li>
            <li> DMSO has been everything it says it is. My husband injured his shoulder and could barely lift his arm \, i applied DMSO to it and he felt a difference that day  He uses it daily to manage his pain. I recommended it to some friends and a couple of them ordered it and are using it also.</li>
            <li> Do not purchase from this vendor!!!!! They completely misrepresent the product! The product page states that DMSO can be used to treat sore muscles and joints. However, once the product is received the label clearly states that it should be used as a solvent only, that it may cause skin irritation, and that it is unlawful to suggest that the product is safe for medicinal use. Nothing on the product page suggested this item is not medicinal. Silly me, thinking an item sold by a company called AmericaRx would be medicinal and not industrial. When I tried to print a return label I could not, because Amazon does not allow return of HAZARDOUS MATERIALS. After going back and forth with the vendor and being told they are just sellers and have no info from the manufacturer, they offered to provide a refund only after I pay out of pocket to send the item back. For the amount I&#x27;d finally be getting back overall it&#x27;s not even worth it. Stay away from this vendor, as they completely misrepresent what they sell.</li>
            <li> This is what a friend suggested me to get and I found this at a good price. It is larger than I needed. So I will have it for a while.</li>
            <li> Its not like the DMSO I&#x27;ve used before .If you put your finger in it you could taste it right away, this you don&#x27;t  and it doesn&#x27;t soak in</li>
            <li> I wanted DMSO for my first aid kit. I haven&#x27;t used this yet, but have used DMSO in the past. I think it&#x27;s one of the best products for your first aid kit.</li>
            <li> My mom uses it and it takes some of her pain away in most of the cases. No complaints here. It is a good product and my mom recommends it.</li>
            <li> Application of this product( a solvent as on the label)  is easy and does reduce my pain for about 4-5 hours.</li>
            <li> Product aa described. Fast shipping. I use it for knee pain.</li>
            <li> I actually have tried many, many products that claim to be oif great benefit but DMSO really works almost immediately. I have been in disabling accidents but still rehabbed myself to lift weights again. On days when the weather and my exercises rebel, this tames the minor or major effects of the wrong exercises or a storm front moving into my area and stirring up my osteo arthritis.</li>
            <li> MOST OF THE TIME IT DID NOT RELIEVE MY PAIN SO I GAVE IT TO MY FRIEND WHO HAS PAIN PROBLEMS.</li>
            <li> After reading the glowing reports on this product, I ordered it with anticipation. Unfortunately the product did not meet my expectations. I applied it to a painful knee and it left a stinging sensation, but did nothing to ease the pain. I found the product to be a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I orderd dmso that the ad said it was 99.8mso yet when I received it it was mark 99.8 dmso 70/30.  riped off again. will no longer deal with this co. !!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing how my joint injuries heal so much faster by rubbing DMSO on affected area.  However, opening a new bottle today of this DMSO product, I was met with a very plastic acrylic industrial odor.  Like many past good products, manufacturers change things usually to save a buck and ruin what was a perfectly good product.  It smells industrial grade alright, as is stated on the label.  So I have moved it to my garage and will visit my local holistic pharmacy for medicinal grade DMSO at twice the cost, but it will be worth it.</li>
            <li> received it with a broken cap but I was refunded thankfully considering the properties of  DMSO</li>
            <li> Somehow the description of \\&quot;pure\\&quot; DMSO doesn&#x27;t mean 100% DMSO, but it is twisted in this case to mean 75% DMSO and 25% distilled water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose it could then be extrapolated to encompass a 1% DMSO to 99% distilled water ratio if the company so desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a given that the DMSO is \\&quot;pure\\&quot; aka unaltered, contaminated etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it is a mix , then it should be shown right up front. \\&quot;Pure DMSO and distilled water in a 75% DMSO to 25% H2O mix\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years. Have been singing Its praises the whole time. Using it for countless sprains aches and otherpsins. Give it a go you will not regret it</li>
            <li> Dmso always works for me and this one does not have a strong garlic smell or taste.</li>
            <li> Great, fast shipping! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love mixing the dmso with my essential oils and makes them work even better really like this company and love how it is in a glass bottle keep up the good work!!!!!</li>
            <li> Have been using DMSO for years on horses, and almost as long for us and our arthritis.  If you don&#x27;t mind the after taste, you can kiss your finger and hand pain goodbye.  Also works for sore muscles, and any number of other things.  Would recommend for almost everyone.  Just a reminder.  A little goes a long way.</li>
