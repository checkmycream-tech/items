            <li>shipment is very fast, item is very good</li>
            <li>My new scar looks great!</li>
            <li>Very happy so far.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I&#x27;d rather feel the stickiness...to make sure it is still  there.</li>
            <li>Easy to use too!</li>
            <li>Mederma is a more affordable gel and in my opinion works just as well.</li>
            <li>But regardless, this has worked better than anything I&#x27;ve tried and if it works on me with my health concerns, it should do wonders for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Best scar cream ever - have recommended this to so many people.&lt;br /&gt;IF you use it on a daily basis you will see results!</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>skin is more smoother.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>We have bought another tube to continue use and see if maybe more time will show more</li>
            <li>and I love the way my lip looked with it on.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s not an approved use</li>
            <li>Nothing is better for scars.</li>
            <li>A top plastic surgeon in LA recommended Kelo-Cote for dog bite scars that he repaired.</li>
            <li>I like this gel better than the bandage style.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product!  </li>
            <li>We are satisfied with the product :)</li>
            <li>I am so glad my doctor advised that I purchase this before my MOHs surgery.</li>
            <li>On one&#x27;s face this is an option, elsewhere I&#x27;m not so sure.</li>
            <li>I see some improvement in my skin and expect more improvement as time goes on.</li>
            <li>At triple the cost of Mederma you might thing this container of silicone guck would work much better.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to test out Kelo-Cote Scar Gel to see if it would make my scar heal better</li>
            <li>I tried others including the M derm, which did not work, and I am 100% satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Love the item works well, my son has a clef lip and we use it for the scars on his lips.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>Very highly recommended by my Dr.  Good price  Can take 90 days -- twice a day to work&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>good substitute for the not-recommended Scar Away product - really works</li>
            <li>They are now about 1/4 of the original size and very light in color.</li>
            <li>I have tried a couple of other brands, but this one works the best.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply and has helped in reducing the scar line.</li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t imagine having to wear it all day, unless it was on an area that you could easily keep covered up and protected from things sticking to it.  </li>
            <li>This is an honest-looking product and as this reviewer encountered it in the warehouse today she was made more aware of the suffering of others and she was glad to know</li>
            <li>Doctor recommended this for my wife after having surgery to remove skin cancer from her back which is doing a great job of helping the skin to heal without leaving a huge car.  </li>
            <li>Kelo coat made a HUGE difference in my scar healing.</li>
            <li>I got burn scars on my face from misuse of an acne light pen.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>think that if you have a very fresh scar</li>
            <li>think that if you have a very fresh scar</li>
            <li>Amazon was awesome about the return as usual.</li>
            <li>Worked great on my 3 inch long foot scar.</li>
            <li>and it has made a significant improvement in my scar.</li>
            <li>Have been using it for 2 month, nothing significantly changed.</li>
            <li>it made large indents on the keloid and gave it an even more \\&quot;disfigured\\&quot; look.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, completely evened out incisions after breast augmentation, highly recommend</li>
            <li>Used the full 90 days as recommended.</li>
            <li>:B001PQBEAI Mederma Scar Gel, 20 Grams]] is tried and true.</li>
            <li>Luckily this is not an issue with my neck scar.  </li>
            <li>I have an older scar on my neck from thyroid surgery that is fairly prominent since they had to go in twice.</li>
            <li>It really works!!</li>
            <li>well, it&#x27;s relatively useful, pics can express everything</li>
            <li>So, the Kelo-Cote did prove to have some benefit that my husband felt was worth it.</li>
            <li>The stickiness lasts about an hour or so, then it is, presumably, absorbed into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month on my fresh bike accident scars -</li>
            <li>will update my review as I use this more, but, so far, it seems to be helping.</li>
            <li>I rarely miss an application)</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t worth it</li>
            <li>This is worth every cent</li>
            <li>Great product, I&#x27;ve used it in the past.  </li>
            <li>I am always searching online for new info on keloids as well as clinical trials etc, so please feel free to add comments below.</li>

            <li>My latest scar has become flatter, losing color and becoming less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>Kelo-Cote is also very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Its ok, you can buy it at  a local CVS for cheaper.</li>
            <li>I had an allergic reaction to this product the first time I put it on, so I can&#x27;t speak to whether it heals scars.  </li>
            <li>You can have some keloids removed, but they come back as any stress or damage to the skin causes more keloids to form in a person who is keloid prone.</li>
            <li>There used to be many nights where if my husband was sleeping on his back, he would wake up and have to switch positions because the keloids would be hurting him.</li>
            <li>If anyone reading this has any advice or info about any products or procedures related to keloids I would love to hear it.</li>
            <li>If anyone reading this has any advice or info about any products or procedures related to keloids I would love to hear it.</li>
            <li>The product was just as we expected and we liked to use it.</li>
            <li>My first scar is not noticeable.  </li>
            <li>However, after using it for a while I find not only does it not work better</li>
            <li>so I am more likely to keiloid.</li>
            <li>in 3weeks even though I didn&#x27;t use it consistently.  </li>
            <li>dry this gel product allows coverage with sunscreen and/or makeup, which would make this great for facial scars.</li>
            <li>It seemed to work well on new scars, helped to heal them up quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product on multiple scars and could not recommend it any more highly!</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed about this scar gel is that it is really sticky.</li>
            <li>I know that everyone reacts differently both to surgery and to post-op treatment, but, based on my experience, I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Package arrived fast.</li>
            <li>so maybe I am using too much.</li>
            <li>This really works to assist in reducing scars.  </li>
            <li>It really worked to minimize the scar.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really upset that I paid so much for this product</li>
            <li>Her pain wasn&#x27;t often to begin with, so we can&#x27;t really gauge that.</li>
            <li>Her pain wasn&#x27;t often to begin with, so we can&#x27;t really gauge that.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>It work very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really minimizing the scar.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and very well wrapped.</li>
            <li>This product has really helped my husband with scars from skin cancer surgeries.  </li>
            <li>To find real relief for scars is a balm for the mind and the body.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s sticky -- you&#x27;ve used too much.</li>
            <li>Price was much lower than the price at the doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see that much of an improvement.</li>
            <li>so it didn&#x27;t bother me much</li>
            <li>Was really hopeful based on the before/after pics in the box.</li>
            <li>This is really a miracle worker.</li>
            <li>This really seems to be working for my son.</li>
            <li>But for more severe cases like in our 2 instances, you just have to realize that unfortunately there is no miracle product out there, aside from plastic surgery and even surgery is not 100% effective or permanent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised that it actually was able to lessen the appearance of my scar.  </li>
            <li>Using the product twice daily has significantly softened the scar tissue.</li>
            <li>I really looked forward to trying this product for older raised scars.  </li>
            <li>I squeezed exactly one third of the tube flat, before any more gel was coming out again.</li>
            <li>I did have any expectation when I first started using it because of how old my scar is</li>
            <li>I have a new scar and it is very soothing to the skin.</li>
            <li>The keloid looks slightly smoother, the edges look smoother and the skin of the keloid is softer, almost seems as if it is slightly more hydrated and supple.</li>
            <li>I used Kelo-Cote for 90 days and it reduced the mottled &amp;#34;bulls-eye&amp;#34; in the center of my forehead to the point it is easily concealed with makeup.</li>
            <li>I had my most recent (and third) surgery on March 22nd of this year.</li>
            <li>WIthin a couple of weeks it is a very thin line with no pain and healing beautifully</li>
            <li>I highly recommend  it</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Have been using it twice a day for a few weeks and one scar is looking great and the other was a bump</li>
            <li>Unlike other reviewers, I haven&#x27;t found it to be too sticky, and it is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Sorry to have such a lengthy review, but I felt it was important to share as much info as possible.</li>

            <li>or if it was just my scar healing normally).  </li>
            <li>and right smack dab in the middle of my throat.</li>
            <li>relatively new-</li>
            <li>Very upset by that cream, expensive and not that good.</li>
            <li>I can see the results of fading the dark scar rather quickly!</li>
            <li>Finally, something that really works!</li>
            <li>so hopefully it makes it disappear completely!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using Kelo-Cote twice a day for a month (I am pretty religious about applying it since the scar is so visible...</li>
            <li>not sure how this works with very old scars, but with scars that are still healing like mine, it worked really well to help smooth out the scar.  </li>
            <li>This gel is advertised for new &amp; old scars.</li>
            <li>and/or minimize the occurance of the potential scar, but only for more minor sites and when used asap after the wound is healed, scab is gone etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and/or minimize the occurance of the potential scar, but only for more minor sites and when used asap after the wound is healed, scab is gone etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We love it also because the price is almost half what the local pharmacies were charging!</li>
            <li>daughter is 14 and has a large keloid from a 3rd degree burn on her shoulder.</li>
            <li>It is working good though a little bit slowly, the appearance of those scars are now much fainter (compared to the pictures I took before I started to use it).  </li>
            <li>Being a teen changing in gym class, wearing tank tops, etc, she has also always been very self conscious of this keloid.</li>
            <li>Maybe the scar has to be \\&quot;fresher\\&quot;, although the literature provided in the box doesn&#x27;t make a clear distinction about it, that I could discern.</li>
            <li>I have notice some change with my old scar and the change with the keloid.</li>
            <li>And applying makeup over this stuff is a complete joke.</li>
            <li>Honestly, do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li>Improvement in my 6 month old scar is noticeable after a month of use.</li>
            <li>worked on my old scar from a pilonidall cyst I had removed.</li>
            <li>Looks as though it&#x27;s almost completely gone...</li>
            <li>but it was at lease 8 month old.</li>
            <li>I have been told it works well for old acne scars as well.</li>
            <li>and I am seeing marked improvements to both.</li>
            <li>The scar healed very nicely, nearly invisible</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too early to know if this is the complete answer to my problem, as the packaging comments recommend using it for 90 days, so I&#x27;ve got a ways to go.</li>
            <li>These are year old scars.</li>
            <li>I do not see any improvement so far.</li>
            <li>would not recommend this product unless you have OLD exposed scars to where you have the time to try to improve them without losing anything.</li>
            <li>You can also use it on old scars which I am trying now along with the foot surgery scar.  </li>
            <li>Working well so far.</li>
            <li>; scar that&#x27;s a year old.</li>
            <li>I liked the way it felt, like a subtle layer of protection for my fragile skin.</li>
            <li>The scar on  my threat is almost flat, and the keloids elsewhere are much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it really helps the scar to heal flat.</li>
            <li>Apply with a Qtip and it will have no mess at all.</li>
            <li>On one&#x27;s face it&#x27;s worth the effort, on other body parts I prefer to slap on a silicone sheet and keep moving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>He said it&#x27;s the same thing and highly recommended it.</li>
            <li>I have a keloid on my left knee, left shoulder, above my right breast</li>
            <li>I bought it for a new scar from a recent surgery but am also applying it to a decades-old scar</li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t dry, you applied too much.</li>
            <li>The keloids range in size from pea sized to the size of a quarter and are odd shaped and very raised - anywhere from 2mm for the newer ones to 6mm for some of the older ones.</li>
            <li>Noticed major differences in scars from surgery-</li>
            <li>In a month of use, I did not notice any improvement,  but had gotten it for two sites where I had moles removed and the skin developed into a raised bump, itchy and red.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just begun using it and can&#x27;t vouch for its ultimate effectiveness, but so far I like the product.</li>
            <li>it turns out I winded up doing a little experiment because I was cheap; my scar seemed to be healing fantastically after I used up my first tube, so I swapped to using a cheaper &amp;#34;silicone glide.&amp;#34;  Pretty much a week into the glide, the scar started keloiding and getting stiff and hard and dry skin in the raised area</li>
            <li>Any small pimple will turn to a keloid for him, so they multiply quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this for a couple of weeks on a scar left from stitches I had six months ago, and so far it seems to be hoping.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not cheap (though cheaper thant the Biocorneum), and I find that it doesn&#x27;t last more than a little over a month</li>
            <li>Less (not more) is the appropriate application.</li>
            <li>On a few of them, the edges do not seem as prominent, almost like they smoothed out very slightly, but again the keloids themselves do not seem smaller  ...</li>
            <li>My other scars however are older and on my leg where this product would not work because it would stick to my pants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The skin on them is very taught/tight and some have creases or slight folds in the centers.</li>
            <li>husband is African American and is keloid prone in general.</li>
            <li>Since there is no real treatment for keloids, we are always open to trying any new product.</li>
            <li>the skin is not so tight as to where it looks like it just wants to burst, but they aren&#x27;t any smaller.</li>
            <li>The scar is still healing, but it&#x27;s flat and not dry.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> -Cote is best used immediately after the scab has come off the wound.</li>
            <li> -Cote is best used immediately after the scab has come off the wound.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li> Kelp-cote was the best.  </li>
            <li> and we&#x27;re both impressed with</li>
            <li> It needs to be applied twice a day (24 hour coverage) for 2-3 months for best results.</li>
            <li> I prefer the silicone sheets for best and quicker results in a couple weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Excellent.</li>
            <li> I have decided to return to my Vitamin E &amp; Cocoa Butter sticks (which are great since they don&#x27;t leave your hands sticky!).</li>
            <li> and I think it is the best thing on the market.</li>
            <li> This stuff if awesome and</li>
            <li> Amazon has the best price.</li>
            <li> Very good product.</li>
            <li> Good item!fast shiping!I like it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.</li>
            <li> The Kelo-cote helped with redness and swelling that I had experienced from a surgical procedure.  </li>
            <li> Each time I was happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Great Results.  </li>
            <li> BUT he&#x27;s a great surgeon too.  </li>

            <li> so it&#x27;s good for the scar on my throat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> It gave a good result.</li>

            <li> I think it&#x27;s a good product as I can see a change already  </li>
            <li> Awesome product, really made a difference!</li>
            <li> Delivered on time and article is amazing</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this works, but it is an effective treatment.  </li>
            <li> have tried this product for a month and to be honest</li>
            <li> shipment is very fast, item is very good</li>
            <li> My new scar looks great!</li>
            <li> Very happy so far.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I&#x27;d rather feel the stickiness...to make sure it is still  there.</li>
            <li> Easy to use too!</li>
            <li> Mederma is a more affordable gel and in my opinion works just as well.</li>
            <li> But regardless, this has worked better than anything I&#x27;ve tried and if it works on me with my health concerns, it should do wonders for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Best scar cream ever - have recommended this to so many people.&lt;br /&gt;IF you use it on a daily basis you will see results!</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> skin is more smoother.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> We have bought another tube to continue use and see if maybe more time will show more</li>
            <li> and I love the way my lip looked with it on.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s not an approved use</li>
            <li> Nothing is better for scars.</li>
            <li> A top plastic surgeon in LA recommended Kelo-Cote for dog bite scars that he repaired.</li>
            <li> I like this gel better than the bandage style.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product!  </li>
            <li> We are satisfied with the product :)</li>
            <li> I am so glad my doctor advised that I purchase this before my MOHs surgery.</li>
            <li> On one&#x27;s face this is an option, elsewhere I&#x27;m not so sure.</li>
            <li> I see some improvement in my skin and expect more improvement as time goes on.</li>
            <li> At triple the cost of Mederma you might thing this container of silicone guck would work much better.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to test out Kelo-Cote Scar Gel to see if it would make my scar heal better</li>
            <li> I tried others including the M derm, which did not work, and I am 100% satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Love the item works well, my son has a clef lip and we use it for the scars on his lips.</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> Very highly recommended by my Dr.  Good price  Can take 90 days -- twice a day to work&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> good substitute for the not-recommended Scar Away product - really works</li>
            <li> They are now about 1/4 of the original size and very light in color.</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple of other brands, but this one works the best.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply and has helped in reducing the scar line.</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t imagine having to wear it all day, unless it was on an area that you could easily keep covered up and protected from things sticking to it.  </li>
            <li> This is an honest-looking product and as this reviewer encountered it in the warehouse today she was made more aware of the suffering of others and she was glad to know</li>
            <li> Doctor recommended this for my wife after having surgery to remove skin cancer from her back which is doing a great job of helping the skin to heal without leaving a huge car.  </li>
            <li> Kelo coat made a HUGE difference in my scar healing.</li>
            <li> I got burn scars on my face from misuse of an acne light pen.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>

            <li> Amazon was awesome about the return as usual.</li>
            <li> Worked great on my 3 inch long foot scar.</li>
            <li> and it has made a significant improvement in my scar.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for 2 month, nothing significantly changed.</li>
            <li> it made large indents on the keloid and gave it an even more \\&quot;disfigured\\&quot; look.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, completely evened out incisions after breast augmentation, highly recommend</li>
            <li> Used the full 90 days as recommended.</li>
            <li> :B001PQBEAI Mederma Scar Gel, 20 Grams]] is tried and true.</li>
            <li> Luckily this is not an issue with my neck scar.  </li>
            <li> I have an older scar on my neck from thyroid surgery that is fairly prominent since they had to go in twice.</li>
            <li> It really works!!</li>
            <li> well, it&#x27;s relatively useful, pics can express everything</li>
            <li> So, the Kelo-Cote did prove to have some benefit that my husband felt was worth it.</li>
            <li> The stickiness lasts about an hour or so, then it is, presumably, absorbed into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month on my fresh bike accident scars -</li>
            <li> will update my review as I use this more, but, so far, it seems to be helping.</li>
            <li> I rarely miss an application)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t worth it</li>
            <li> This is worth every cent</li>
            <li> Great product, I&#x27;ve used it in the past.  </li>
            <li> I am always searching online for new info on keloids as well as clinical trials etc, so please feel free to add comments below.</li>

            <li> My latest scar has become flatter, losing color and becoming less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Kelo-Cote is also very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Its ok, you can buy it at  a local CVS for cheaper.</li>
            <li> I had an allergic reaction to this product the first time I put it on, so I can&#x27;t speak to whether it heals scars.  </li>
            <li> You can have some keloids removed, but they come back as any stress or damage to the skin causes more keloids to form in a person who is keloid prone.</li>
            <li> There used to be many nights where if my husband was sleeping on his back, he would wake up and have to switch positions because the keloids would be hurting him.</li>
            <li> If anyone reading this has any advice or info about any products or procedures related to keloids I would love to hear it.</li>
            <li> If anyone reading this has any advice or info about any products or procedures related to keloids I would love to hear it.</li>
            <li> The product was just as we expected and we liked to use it.</li>
            <li> My first scar is not noticeable.  </li>
            <li> However, after using it for a while I find not only does it not work better</li>
            <li> so I am more likely to keiloid.</li>
            <li> in 3weeks even though I didn&#x27;t use it consistently.  </li>
            <li> dry this gel product allows coverage with sunscreen and/or makeup, which would make this great for facial scars.</li>
            <li> It seemed to work well on new scars, helped to heal them up quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product on multiple scars and could not recommend it any more highly!</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed about this scar gel is that it is really sticky.</li>
            <li> I know that everyone reacts differently both to surgery and to post-op treatment, but, based on my experience, I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Package arrived fast.</li>
            <li> so maybe I am using too much.</li>
            <li> This really works to assist in reducing scars.  </li>
            <li> It really worked to minimize the scar.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really upset that I paid so much for this product</li>
            <li> Her pain wasn&#x27;t often to begin with, so we can&#x27;t really gauge that.</li>
            <li> Her pain wasn&#x27;t often to begin with, so we can&#x27;t really gauge that.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> It work very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really minimizing the scar.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and very well wrapped.</li>
            <li> This product has really helped my husband with scars from skin cancer surgeries.  </li>
            <li> To find real relief for scars is a balm for the mind and the body.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s sticky -- you&#x27;ve used too much.</li>
            <li> Price was much lower than the price at the doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see that much of an improvement.</li>
            <li> so it didn&#x27;t bother me much</li>
            <li> Was really hopeful based on the before/after pics in the box.</li>
            <li> This is really a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> This really seems to be working for my son.</li>
            <li> But for more severe cases like in our 2 instances, you just have to realize that unfortunately there is no miracle product out there, aside from plastic surgery and even surgery is not 100% effective or permanent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> but I was pleasantly surprised that it actually was able to lessen the appearance of my scar.  </li>
            <li> Using the product twice daily has significantly softened the scar tissue.</li>
            <li> I really looked forward to trying this product for older raised scars.  </li>
            <li> I squeezed exactly one third of the tube flat, before any more gel was coming out again.</li>
            <li> I did have any expectation when I first started using it because of how old my scar is</li>
            <li> I have a new scar and it is very soothing to the skin.</li>
            <li> The keloid looks slightly smoother, the edges look smoother and the skin of the keloid is softer, almost seems as if it is slightly more hydrated and supple.</li>
            <li> I used Kelo-Cote for 90 days and it reduced the mottled &amp;#34;bulls-eye&amp;#34; in the center of my forehead to the point it is easily concealed with makeup.</li>
            <li> I had my most recent (and third) surgery on March 22nd of this year.</li>
            <li> WIthin a couple of weeks it is a very thin line with no pain and healing beautifully</li>
            <li> I highly recommend  it</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Have been using it twice a day for a few weeks and one scar is looking great and the other was a bump</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviewers, I haven&#x27;t found it to be too sticky, and it is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry to have such a lengthy review, but I felt it was important to share as much info as possible.</li>

            <li> and right smack dab in the middle of my throat.</li>
            <li> relatively new-</li>
            <li> Very upset by that cream, expensive and not that good.</li>
            <li> I can see the results of fading the dark scar rather quickly!</li>
            <li> Finally, something that really works!</li>
            <li> so hopefully it makes it disappear completely!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using Kelo-Cote twice a day for a month (I am pretty religious about applying it since the scar is so visible...</li>
            <li> not sure how this works with very old scars, but with scars that are still healing like mine, it worked really well to help smooth out the scar.  </li>
            <li> This gel is advertised for new &amp; old scars.</li>
            <li> and/or minimize the occurance of the potential scar, but only for more minor sites and when used asap after the wound is healed, scab is gone etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and/or minimize the occurance of the potential scar, but only for more minor sites and when used asap after the wound is healed, scab is gone etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We love it also because the price is almost half what the local pharmacies were charging!</li>
            <li> daughter is 14 and has a large keloid from a 3rd degree burn on her shoulder.</li>
            <li> It is working good though a little bit slowly, the appearance of those scars are now much fainter (compared to the pictures I took before I started to use it).  </li>
            <li> Being a teen changing in gym class, wearing tank tops, etc, she has also always been very self conscious of this keloid.</li>
            <li> Maybe the scar has to be \\&quot;fresher\\&quot;, although the literature provided in the box doesn&#x27;t make a clear distinction about it, that I could discern.</li>
            <li> I have notice some change with my old scar and the change with the keloid.</li>
            <li> And applying makeup over this stuff is a complete joke.</li>
            <li> Honestly, do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> Improvement in my 6 month old scar is noticeable after a month of use.</li>
            <li> worked on my old scar from a pilonidall cyst I had removed.</li>
            <li> Looks as though it&#x27;s almost completely gone...</li>
            <li> but it was at lease 8 month old.</li>
            <li> I have been told it works well for old acne scars as well.</li>
            <li> and I am seeing marked improvements to both.</li>
            <li> The scar healed very nicely, nearly invisible</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early to know if this is the complete answer to my problem, as the packaging comments recommend using it for 90 days, so I&#x27;ve got a ways to go.</li>
            <li> These are year old scars.</li>
            <li> I do not see any improvement so far.</li>
            <li> would not recommend this product unless you have OLD exposed scars to where you have the time to try to improve them without losing anything.</li>
            <li> You can also use it on old scars which I am trying now along with the foot surgery scar.  </li>
            <li> Working well so far.</li>
            <li> ; scar that&#x27;s a year old.</li>
            <li> I liked the way it felt, like a subtle layer of protection for my fragile skin.</li>
            <li> The scar on  my threat is almost flat, and the keloids elsewhere are much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it really helps the scar to heal flat.</li>
            <li> Apply with a Qtip and it will have no mess at all.</li>
            <li> On one&#x27;s face it&#x27;s worth the effort, on other body parts I prefer to slap on a silicone sheet and keep moving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He said it&#x27;s the same thing and highly recommended it.</li>
            <li> I have a keloid on my left knee, left shoulder, above my right breast</li>
            <li> I bought it for a new scar from a recent surgery but am also applying it to a decades-old scar</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t dry, you applied too much.</li>
            <li> The keloids range in size from pea sized to the size of a quarter and are odd shaped and very raised - anywhere from 2mm for the newer ones to 6mm for some of the older ones.</li>
            <li> Noticed major differences in scars from surgery-</li>
            <li> In a month of use, I did not notice any improvement,  but had gotten it for two sites where I had moles removed and the skin developed into a raised bump, itchy and red.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just begun using it and can&#x27;t vouch for its ultimate effectiveness, but so far I like the product.</li>
            <li> it turns out I winded up doing a little experiment because I was cheap; my scar seemed to be healing fantastically after I used up my first tube, so I swapped to using a cheaper &amp;#34;silicone glide.&amp;#34;  Pretty much a week into the glide, the scar started keloiding and getting stiff and hard and dry skin in the raised area</li>
            <li> Any small pimple will turn to a keloid for him, so they multiply quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a couple of weeks on a scar left from stitches I had six months ago, and so far it seems to be hoping.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap (though cheaper thant the Biocorneum), and I find that it doesn&#x27;t last more than a little over a month</li>
            <li> Less (not more) is the appropriate application.</li>
            <li> On a few of them, the edges do not seem as prominent, almost like they smoothed out very slightly, but again the keloids themselves do not seem smaller  ...</li>
            <li> My other scars however are older and on my leg where this product would not work because it would stick to my pants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The skin on them is very taught/tight and some have creases or slight folds in the centers.</li>
            <li> husband is African American and is keloid prone in general.</li>
            <li> Since there is no real treatment for keloids, we are always open to trying any new product.</li>
            <li> the skin is not so tight as to where it looks like it just wants to burst, but they aren&#x27;t any smaller.</li>
            <li> The scar is still healing, but it&#x27;s flat and not dry.  </li>
            <li> It could really let the scar to be lighter and I only used it for less than one week!</li>
            <li> I would still like to try this on my old scars, but don&#x27;t think it is possible due to the stickiness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a C section 1 year ago, the scar is not as old as other people were talking about.</li>
            <li> Though my scars are not brand new, I&#x27;ve had them for less than a year.</li>
            <li> My son had mohrs surgery on his nose &amp; was left with a long red scar.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the tube only contains .35 ounces of gel, so if you are using this on a large area it may be a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I can see much of a difference...</li>
            <li> My scar is about an inch long and very recent</li>
            <li> I hope I could get rid of the scar in the not far future!</li>
            <li> and it is almost flat.</li>
            <li> She would only experience the random phantom pain every couple months, so it wasn&#x27;t a huge issue.</li>
            <li> She would only experience the random phantom pain every couple months, so it wasn&#x27;t a huge issue.</li>
            <li> so you need far less than you think.</li>
            <li> About 80% of his shoulders are covered with keloids and they have started to grow down further onto the middle of his back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although this is a tiny tube and the cost may put you off, you need to weigh the costs, time and expected benefits.</li>
            <li> so I expected some change, not enough for me to continue use.</li>
            <li> I will see, maybe it will take long to see a difference</li>
            <li> It comes in a very small tube, which, to me, makes the price point seem high in comparison to similar products on the market.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products and I keep going back to Kelocote.</li>
            <li> Scars are going away like review says I just wish the little tiny container was bigger.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really dry well and stayed sticky.</li>
            <li> It also stays sticky on my neck and does not seem to EVER dry.</li>
            <li> Let it dry for 5 min.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need to add a few extra minutes to your daily routine to include this product in it.</li>
            <li> I applied a thin layer of the gel twice a day for a little over a month before I saw a significant change.</li>
            <li> You can barely tell that I&#x27;ve even had surgery after using this for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I woke up with a red raw oozing suture line that had been healed enough for the dermatologist to give me the go ahead to start using this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 30 days, and my scars are starting to flatten out and be less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I almost feel like the skin is even thicker and has more scar tissue, than when I had similar wounds and let them heal without any silicone gels :(</li>
            <li> Anyway.. other than that, her main complaint with the keloid is that it itches often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes and takes only a few minutes to completely dry.</li>
            <li> The only downside is it&#x27;s a little pricy</li>
            <li> The most beneficial thing since using Kelo-Cote has been that the keloids are not as painful as often.</li>
            <li> as my scar was closed...</li>
            <li> Not fast working though.</li>
            <li> Ive only been using this product for a few weeks but am already seeing results on my surgical scar</li>
            <li> The tube is very small for the price, but most of these anti-scar products are relatively expensive.  </li>
            <li> ONE FRIEND HAS ANIMAL BITE SCARS AND THE OTHER HAS SHINGLES SCARS.</li>
            <li> I must say I have placed another other today.</li>
            <li> Either one of them can damage the item, and mineral spirits are extremely toxic.  </li>
            <li> #34;droopy eyelids&amp;#34;  and other problems which were interfering with my vision.  </li>
            <li> on the other hand, did help diminish the scars when I switched over to it.</li>
            <li> If you have a gooey mess then you are using way too much, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> They are still very dark and rough.</li>
            <li> It takes at least 90 days of continues use, but even a big scar (12 stiches) became almost invisible.</li>
            <li> Other comments have said this stuff was a gooey mess</li>
            <li> It is anywhere from 2-5mm thick depending on the area of the keloid and it is about 3 inches wide and 5 minches long.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li> I have a medium dark skin tone</li>
            <li> I am inclined to believe this is due the the actual pain of the burn itself, much like when someone endures a bad injury and loses a limb - they have \\&quot;phantom\\&quot; pain in the \\&quot;limb\\&quot; which is actually no longer there.</li>
            <li> and my raised incisions started to go down within 3 days.  </li>
            <li> I did expect it to last longer, but it is a very small tube almost like a trial size.</li>
            <li> It lasted less than 3weeks if using 2x a day like you should.</li>
            <li> He is very self conscious about them and they do tend to be painful at random times, as well as when sitting in a chair - when his back is against the chair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I went and did a little research,</li>
            <li> They were stopped due to pain with no real results other then just making the keloid look worse -</li>
            <li> It seems working, I got my acne scar lighten a little bit.</li>
            <li> That last one has been tough because I can&#x27;t cover it unless I wear a turtleneck.</li>
            <li> A few of them seem \\&quot;softer\\&quot; ...</li>
            <li> I was about 3 months out of ankle surgery to fix a broken ankle and had incision scars all along my inside and outside ankle from sutures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will not purchase again did not work , wasted money</li>
            <li> However, you will have to be patient because it takes a few tubes before you will see the result.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to waste money buying another tube.  </li>
            <li> They were dark and thick.  </li>
            <li> We used those for about a year and half - until she just got tired of going through the hassle with no results other than a \\&quot;soggy\\&quot; keloid.</li>
            <li> He had a bad case of cystic acne on his back which left scars.</li>
            <li> I have been used it for over 60 days, haven&#x27;t see results yet and not sure after 90 days will have change.</li>
            <li> Not sure which ingredient I reacted to.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a small tube, just to see if I like it.</li>
            <li> I opened the box and took out the small tube.</li>
            <li> A small bead began to come out.</li>
            <li> Sadly, there is not much improvement.</li>
            <li> You need to keep at it for at least two months, depending on the depth of the scar.</li>
            <li> Some people have complained about the stickiness of the gel.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make any noticable reduction, at least not after a months use.</li>
            <li> My scar started out thick and sore.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and greasy.</li>
            <li> it is hard to explain, but if you have keloids or are caring for someone who has them, and you&#x27;ve tried products for them, then you probably understand what I mean.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Had serious knee surgeries; bot knees replaced.</li>
            <li> Now, you can hardly see it!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it was impossible to find in local drug stores, so I ordered it online.  </li>
            <li> A thin coating is all that is needed.  </li>
            <li> Of course her shoulder is still there, but it is occupied by the (dead) scar tissue of the keloid and numb, so in a sense not there</li>
            <li> I apply a thin coat as directed.</li>
            <li> These options either worked or were too painful (the cortisone shots), so I am always looking for other options.</li>
            <li> Also, they do not hurt as often when sitting in a chair and the random pain for no reason has decreased as well.</li>
            <li> She too has random \\&quot;phantom\\&quot; pain on the keloid.</li>
            <li> Sad but true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sad but true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about how effectiveness this would be (and even if I would know if it was working</li>
            <li> Shocking how only used for 1 week and got results.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> I apply a very thin amount and always keep it stored in the refrigerator, but it never dries and ends up rubbing off on my pillow at night.</li>
            <li> Kelo-Cote MUST be applied very thinly.</li>
            <li> You apply a very very thin coat.</li>
            <li> It is VERY expensive.</li>
            <li> The price is not too bad but it does not work for scars.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed-</li>
            <li> In addition, you get this nasty sticky feeling with the silicone sitting on your skin.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>

            <li> MY DOCTOR RECOMM. ORDERED FOR TWO FRIENDS. ONE FRIEND HAS ANIMAL BITE SCARS AND THE OTHER HAS SHINGLES SCARS. SEEMS TO BE WORKING WELL.</li>
            <li> I have been used it for over 60 days, haven&#x27;t see results yet and not sure after 90 days will have change.</li>
            <li> I got a different product, I ordered it because it was like the one I have been using, in the picture, but I got a different brand or name, scar away.</li>
            <li> Its ok, you can buy it at  a local CVS for cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products and I keep going back to Kelocote. It doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes and takes only a few minutes to completely dry. I have a new scar and it is very soothing to the skin.</li>
            <li> Good item!fast shiping!I like it!</li>
            <li> In a month of use, I did not notice any improvement,  but had gotten it for two sites where I had moles removed and the skin developed into a raised bump, itchy and red.  My dermatologist says that maybe an injection of silicone will help.</li>
            <li> Like it but a bit pricey.  Mederma is a more affordable gel and in my opinion works just as well.</li>
            <li> Finally, something that really works! This was suggested by my surgeon and I started using it as soon as my scar was closed... Now, you can hardly see it!</li>
            <li> When i ordered this product, it said .92 ounce tube but when I received the product it was only .35 ounce. This  is not what I paid for.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works but not obvious.</li>
            <li> This product actually does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, make scars almost disappear. It takes at least 90 days of continues use, but even a big scar (12 stiches) became almost invisible. I wouldn&#x27;t believe it myself before I tried it out, but this is an awesome product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I highly recommend  it</li>
            <li> Definitely helped smoothen a scar after wrist surgery.  The scar is still healing, but it&#x27;s flat and not dry.  Package arrived fast.</li>
            <li> Expired date 2017, good</li>
            <li> Scars are bothersome for ladies.  this product minimizes the trama.</li>
            <li> I have an autoimmune condition that causes my body to form scar tissue if my skin is damaged. I have a keloid on my left knee, left shoulder, above my right breast and right smack dab in the middle of my throat. That last one has been tough because I can&#x27;t cover it unless I wear a turtleneck. And even then...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried all sorts of scar treatments, from the silicon sheets to the various creams and gels. You name it, I tried it. I finally went to a plastic surgeon who gave me something  called  Biocorneum - which is a gooey cream that you put on the scar. It is VERY expensive. It has sunblock so it&#x27;s good for the scar on my throat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He recently told me that I didn&#x27;t have to spend the money on the biocorneum - that the ingredient was in this product,, this Kelo-cote. He said it&#x27;s the same thing and highly recommended it. So I got it, and I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months. The scar on  my threat is almost flat, and the keloids elsewhere are much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the thing - you have to use this religiously twice a day. It&#x27;s not cheap (though cheaper thant the Biocorneum), and I find that it doesn&#x27;t last more than a little over a month so maybe I am using too much. But regardless, this has worked better than anything I&#x27;ve tried and if it works on me with my health concerns, it should do wonders for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!!!! It really works!!</li>
            <li> I had an allergic reaction to this product the first time I put it on, so I can&#x27;t speak to whether it heals scars.  I woke up with a red raw oozing suture line that had been healed enough for the dermatologist to give me the go ahead to start using this product.  Not sure which ingredient I reacted to.  Amazon was awesome about the return as usual.</li>
            <li> Scars are going away like review says I just wish the little tiny container was bigger. It lasted less than 3weeks if using 2x a day like you should.</li>
            <li> This really works to assist in reducing scars.  A thin coating is all that is needed.  I have tried a couple of other brands, but this one works the best.  It was recommended to me by a podiatrist for foot scars after foot surgery.  It really worked to minimize the scar.  They are almost invisible now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. Not fast working though.</li>
            <li> My doctor agrees this is the best scar jell on the market. Every time one of my friends has surgery I order another tube for them.</li>
            <li> I purchased a small tube, just to see if I like it. I must say I have placed another other today. That should explain how I like the product. I have notice some change with my old scar and the change with the keloid. My new scar looks great! I have also recommended Kelo-cote to a friend.</li>
            <li> This product has no effect for me,wasting my money</li>
            <li> well, it&#x27;s relatively useful, pics can express everything</li>
            <li> Best scar cream ever - have recommended this to so many people.&lt;br /&gt;IF you use it on a daily basis you will see results!</li>
            <li> I used for 2 months but didn&#x27;t see the result yet</li>
            <li> The Kelo-cote helped with redness and swelling that I had experienced from a surgical procedure.  Easy to use too!</li>
            <li> I have used two of it but nothing happened.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a week now and I am already seeing a difference. My scar is about an inch long and very recent so I still have marks and redness from the stitches. Other comments have said this stuff was a gooey mess but it is not. I had mixed feelings about this product after reading the comments but I went and did a little research, looked at before and afters and decided to give it a shot. So far so good! If you have a gooey mess then you are using way too much, a little goes a long way! Very happy so far.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I find it you use it religiously after the stitches come out it really helps the scar to heal flat. I have used it after my abdominal surgery, lung surgery and head surgery. Each time I was happy with the results. The product is to be applied sparingly so you need far less than you think.</li>
            <li> Doctor recommended this for my wife after having surgery to remove skin cancer from her back which is doing a great job of helping the skin to heal without leaving a huge car.  We love it also because the price is almost half what the local pharmacies were charging!</li>
            <li> product used with the mepiform helps reduce my scars.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is more smoother.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really upset that I paid so much for this product and it never dries on my skin. I apply a very thin amount and always keep it stored in the refrigerator, but it never dries and ends up rubbing off on my pillow at night. And applying makeup over this stuff is a complete joke. Honestly, do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I have been applying this gel on my husband and daughter. Both have keloids, but different types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband is African American and is keloid prone in general. About 80% of his shoulders are covered with keloids and they have started to grow down further onto the middle of his back. Any small pimple will turn to a keloid for him, so they multiply quickly. The keloids range in size from pea sized to the size of a quarter and are odd shaped and very raised - anywhere from 2mm for the newer ones to 6mm for some of the older ones. The skin on them is very taught/tight and some have creases or slight folds in the centers. Since there is no real treatment for keloids, we are always open to trying any new product. You can have some keloids removed, but they come back as any stress or damage to the skin causes more keloids to form in a person who is keloid prone. He is very self conscious about them and they do tend to be painful at random times, as well as when sitting in a chair - when his back is against the chair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been applying this for him for 2 months, twice a day. Sadly, there is not much improvement. A few of them seem \\&quot;softer\\&quot; ... the skin is not so tight as to where it looks like it just wants to burst, but they aren&#x27;t any smaller. On a few of them, the edges do not seem as prominent, almost like they smoothed out very slightly, but again the keloids themselves do not seem smaller  ... it is hard to explain, but if you have keloids or are caring for someone who has them, and you&#x27;ve tried products for them, then you probably understand what I mean. The most beneficial thing since using Kelo-Cote has been that the keloids are not as painful as often. There used to be many nights where if my husband was sleeping on his back, he would wake up and have to switch positions because the keloids would be hurting him. Also, they do not hurt as often when sitting in a chair and the random pain for no reason has decreased as well. So, the Kelo-Cote did prove to have some benefit that my husband felt was worth it. We have bought another tube to continue use and see if maybe more time will show more results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter is 14 and has a large keloid from a 3rd degree burn on her shoulder. It is anywhere from 2-5mm thick depending on the area of the keloid and it is about 3 inches wide and 5 minches long. Being a teen changing in gym class, wearing tank tops, etc, she has also always been very self conscious of this keloid. For years kids have said to her \\&quot;ew what happened??\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has had medical grade silicon sheets that we received from the plastic surgeon. We used those for about a year and half - until she just got tired of going through the hassle with no results other than a \\&quot;soggy\\&quot; keloid. I have bought every cream, lotion and oil on the market and of course, still no results. She also went through a series of cortisone shots, as it has been shown sometimes to shrink and/or reform keloids. They were stopped due to pain with no real results other then just making the keloid look worse - it made large indents on the keloid and gave it an even more \\&quot;disfigured\\&quot; look. She too has random \\&quot;phantom\\&quot; pain on the keloid. I am inclined to believe this is due the the actual pain of the burn itself, much like when someone endures a bad injury and loses a limb - they have \\&quot;phantom\\&quot; pain in the \\&quot;limb\\&quot; which is actually no longer there. Of course her shoulder is still there, but it is occupied by the (dead) scar tissue of the keloid and numb, so in a sense not there and therefore my belief of the phantom pain on that site. Anyway.. other than that, her main complaint with the keloid is that it itches often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been applying the Kelo-Cote to her for 2 months as well, twice a day. The keloid looks slightly smoother, the edges look smoother and the skin of the keloid is softer, almost seems as if it is slightly more hydrated and supple. It has not shrunk in size or disappeared in any way.There is no miracle cream, gel, oil etc that will do that. Sad but true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The itching isn&#x27;t as often for her, though. Her pain wasn&#x27;t often to begin with, so we can&#x27;t really gauge that. She would only experience the random phantom pain every couple months, so it wasn&#x27;t a huge issue. For her, we will continue to use another tube as well and see if any further improvements are visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that if you have a very fresh scar and/or a smaller scar, you might see some improvement in the condition and/or size. But for more severe cases like in our 2 instances, you just have to realize that unfortunately there is no miracle product out there, aside from plastic surgery and even surgery is not 100% effective or permanent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kelo-Cote is best used immediately after the scab has come off the wound. You will want to use is asap as the skin starts to renew itself and repair itself. I do believe it can help \\&quot;form\\&quot;  and/or minimize the occurance of the potential scar, but only for more minor sites and when used asap after the wound is healed, scab is gone etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry to have such a lengthy review, but I felt it was important to share as much info as possible. If anyone reading this has any advice or info about any products or procedures related to keloids I would love to hear it. I am always searching online for new info on keloids as well as clinical trials etc, so please feel free to add comments below.There is no miracle cream, gel, oil etc that will do that.

            <li> Great Results.  Just ordered 2nd tube.  Expect 2 tubes to do the job...&lt;br /&gt;Had serious knee surgeries; bot knees replaced.</li>
            <li> Well I don&#x27;t see any effects yet. But I&#x27;ll give a five star for it.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, completely evened out incisions after breast augmentation, highly recommend</li>
            <li> I bought this for when I had stitches on my lip. This stuff is awesome. Helped with scaring and I love the way my lip looked with it on. Like it should be lip gloss but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s not an approved use haha.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist.  Worked well but you have to use it often and for several months.</li>
            <li> Nothing is better for scars. A top plastic surgeon in LA recommended Kelo-Cote for dog bite scars that he repaired. The only downside is it&#x27;s a little pricy but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I like this gel better than the bandage style.  Improvement in my 6 month old scar is noticeable after a month of use.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!  I was really skeptical about how effectiveness this would be (and even if I would know if it was working or if it was just my scar healing normally).  I was about 3 months out of ankle surgery to fix a broken ankle and had incision scars all along my inside and outside ankle from sutures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it turns out I winded up doing a little experiment because I was cheap; my scar seemed to be healing fantastically after I used up my first tube, so I swapped to using a cheaper &amp;#34;silicone glide.&amp;#34;  Pretty much a week into the glide, the scar started keloiding and getting stiff and hard and dry skin in the raised area (it was itchy too!) I winded up buying a second tube and have gotten the scar to flatten out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how this works with very old scars, but with scars that are still healing like mine, it worked really well to help smooth out the scar.  I will found out if the marks fade.</li>
            <li> It work very well. Shocking how only used for 1 week and got results.  I did expect it to last longer, but it is a very small tube almost like a trial size.</li>
            <li> It does remove my redness.</li>
            <li> We use this on my Granddaughter&#x27;s lip since she&#x27;s had a cleft lip repair. It&#x27;s really minimizing the scar. Would highly recommend it. We put it on twice a day. It was recommended to us by the Plastic Surgery nurse practitioner at the Children&#x27;s Hospital.</li>
            <li> maybe some good change</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t make the scars itch like mederma</li>
            <li> I have used this product on multiple scars and could not recommend it any more highly! You can barely tell that I&#x27;ve even had surgery after using this for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> worked on my old scar from a pilonidall cyst I had removed. Looks as though it&#x27;s almost completely gone...I bought another one to continue because I kept seeing results..so hopefully it makes it disappear completely!</li>
            <li> The coupon on the instruction was expried(12/31/2014). Although the medication didn&#x27;t exprie but it was at lease 8 month old.</li>
            <li> The product was just as we expected and we liked to use it. We are satisfied with the product :)</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and very well wrapped. The price is not too bad but it does not work for scars. If you are looking for a product to remove your scars after surgery this one is not it.</li>
            <li> Have been using Kelo-Cote as part of post-op treatment after removal of skin cancer from my nose. Easy to apply and has helped in reducing the scar line.</li>
            <li> This product has really helped my husband with scars from skin cancer surgeries.  You need to keep at it for at least two months, depending on the depth of the scar.</li>
            <li> To find real relief for scars is a balm for the mind and the body. This is an honest-looking product and as this reviewer encountered it in the warehouse today she was made more aware of the suffering of others and she was glad to know Kelo-Cote makes a product that appears to work. The before and after photographs lend credence to the efficacy of the gel. The package instructions call for twice a day application - morning and night. There is hope to alleviate the self-consciousness that often accompanies wounds and scars.</li>
            <li> I got burn scars on my face from misuse of an acne light pen.  I bought scar away, mederma, and kelp cote to try them all.  Kelp-cote was the best.  Apply with a Qtip and it will have no mess at all.</li>
            <li> Very highly recommended by my Dr.  Good price  Can take 90 days -- twice a day to work&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use. If it&#x27;s sticky -- you&#x27;ve used too much.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, really made a difference! I am so glad my doctor advised that I purchase this before my MOHs surgery.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by the nurse-practitioner who&#x27;s been treating me after my facial surgery.  Unfortunately, it was impossible to find in local drug stores, so I ordered it online.  The tube is very small for the price, but most of these anti-scar products are relatively expensive.  I do like the way the gel clings to my skin, forming a layer that&#x27;s supposed to diminish scarring.  I&#x27;ve just begun using it and can&#x27;t vouch for its ultimate effectiveness, but so far I like the product.</li>
            <li> still not find any result</li>
            <li> My Surgeon recommended  Kelo-Cote after having extensive skin cancer surgery on my forehead. It gave a good result. Kelo-Cote MUST be applied very thinly. Less (not more) is the appropriate application. Patience is required. I used Kelo-Cote for 90 days and it reduced the mottled &amp;#34;bulls-eye&amp;#34; in the center of my forehead to the point it is easily concealed with makeup. I give Kelo-Cote to all expectant mother&#x27;s as a baby shower gift. I have been told it works well for old acne scars as well. Kelo-Cote is also very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> hopefully over time using this product will show its results. we haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working as well as similar formulation purchased from the doctor. Price was much lower than the price at the doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Helpful to remove the scar. Will buy again if in need.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time and article is amazing</li>
            <li> Will not purchase again did not work , wasted money</li>
            <li> My son had mohrs surgery on his nose &amp; was left with a long red scar.  He&#x27;s been using this and we&#x27;re both impressed with how well it&#x27;s helping the scar to heal &amp; fade</li>
            <li> My scar started out thick and sore. WIthin a couple of weeks it is a very thin line with no pain and healing beautifully</li>
            <li> Great product, I&#x27;ve used it in the past.  I bought it for a new scar from a recent surgery but am also applying it to a decades-old scar and I am seeing marked improvements to both.</li>
            <li> Not seeing any change after a month</li>
            <li> My surgeon gave me silicone sheets to use after surgery to minimize scarring. The scar healed very nicely, nearly invisible BUT he&#x27;s a great surgeon too.  I really looked forward to trying this product for older raised scars.  This gel is advertised for new &amp; old scars. It needs to be applied twice a day (24 hour coverage) for 2-3 months for best results. I prefer the silicone sheets for best and quicker results in a couple weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When dry this gel product allows coverage with sunscreen and/or makeup, which would make this great for facial scars. HOWEVER there are drying issues with this product. It didn&#x27;t really dry well and stayed sticky. The drying issues ARE addressed in the product insert. It&#x27;s recommended that in hotter climates, keep the gel in the refrigerator. In cooler climates, use a hair dryer on low setting to speed up drying. You&#x27;ll need to add a few extra minutes to your daily routine to include this product in it. On one&#x27;s face it&#x27;s worth the effort, on other body parts I prefer to slap on a silicone sheet and keep moving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this is a tiny tube and the cost may put you off, you need to weigh the costs, time and expected benefits. On one&#x27;s face this is an option, elsewhere I&#x27;m not so sure. I&#x27;ll keep you posted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using kelocote for the second time for second neck surgery scar.  It was recommended by my dermatologist who also told me that mederma is just like using Vaseline.  My first scar is not noticeable.  My latest scar has become flatter, losing color and becoming less noticeable.  It only takes a tiny amount or it will be sticky.  You also have to be patient.  I will be ordering another tube.</li>
            <li> When I requested this product for review I wasn&#x27;t too optimistic that it would work.  I was wrong.  I had two hypertrophic scars from a surgery I underwent about 4 years ago.  Each scar was about one inch in length.  They were dark and thick.  I applied a thin layer of the gel twice a day for a little over a month before I saw a significant change. The scars are almost gone.  They are now about 1/4 of the original size and very light in color. I don&#x27;t know how this works, but it is an effective treatment.  I wish I would have known about this when I had my surgery.  My only complaint is that the tube only contains .35 ounces of gel, so if you are using this on a large area it may be a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 30 days, and my scars are starting to flatten out and be less noticeable. It&#x27;s too early to know if this is the complete answer to my problem, as the packaging comments recommend using it for 90 days, so I&#x27;ve got a ways to go. So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I suffer from Keloids all over my shoulders. These are year old scars. I have tried just about everything to diminish the look. Cortisone shots, silicone sheets, vitamin E, etc... These options either worked or were too painful (the cortisone shots), so I am always looking for other options. I was eager to tried this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are to apply twice a day. The recommended treatment duration is about 90 days. Some people have complained about the stickiness of the gel. To me this has not been an issue. It does not affect the clothes. I apply a thin coat as directed. To be honest, I&#x27;d rather feel the stickiness...to make sure it is still  there. The stickiness lasts about an hour or so, then it is, presumably, absorbed into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried this product for a month and to be honest I don&#x27;t see that much of an improvement. My family does though. They do say the raised scars are a bit lower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review as things progress.</li>
            <li> Kilo-cote is a product to reduce the appearance of scars. Healing time varies with individuals. I have a 90 day supply and have only used this product for 3 weeks. I see some improvement in my skin and expect more improvement as time goes on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month on my fresh bike accident scars - I do not see any improvement so far. They are still very dark and rough. I almost feel like the skin is even thicker and has more scar tissue, than when I had similar wounds and let them heal without any silicone gels :(</li>
            <li> good substitute for the not-recommended Scar Away product - really works</li>
            <li> Seems to be reducing the appearance of my scar</li>
            <li> I just bought it to keep using it on a surgery scar, my doctor  prescribed. I&#x27;m not sure if I can see much of a difference... I keeping using it, let&#x27;s see.</li>
            <li> It could really let the scar to be lighter and I only used it for less than one week! I hope I could get rid of the scar in the not far future!</li>
            <li> Used on my scar per my plastic surgeon after cancer removal.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all for hyperpigmented, non-keloid scars.  I have applied it twice daily for three months, which is now outside the return window.  Save your money and try something else!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed- no changes seen. Used as directed In hypertrophic scar from surgical incision. It didn&#x27;t make any noticable reduction, at least not after a months use. Scar relatively new- so I expected some change, not enough for me to continue use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a couple of weeks on a scar left from stitches I had six months ago, and so far it seems to be hoping.  Unlike other reviewers, I haven&#x27;t found it to be too sticky, and it is easy to apply.  You do have to commit to using this twice a day  for 90 days order to see improvements, but if you can do that, this should work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update my review as I use this more, but, so far, it seems to be helping.</li>
            <li> It seemed to work well on new scars, helped to heal them up quickly.  it is tacky to the touch once on, so i would just wear it overnight with hand lotion so it didn&#x27;t bother me much and it still worked for me.  i can&#x27;t imagine having to wear it all day, unless it was on an area that you could easily keep covered up and protected from things sticking to it.  i was using this product on my hands for some burns and i must say i am please with the results.</li>
            <li> Excellent. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> It seems working, I got my acne scar lighten a little bit. But I&#x27;m a big fan of the texture of this product, kinda too oily, and makes me break out.</li>
            <li> Works great on my c-section scar from 4 years ago.  I did have any expectation when I first started using it because of how old my scar is but I was pleasantly surprised that it actually was able to lessen the appearance of my scar.  However, you will have to be patient because it takes a few tubes before you will see the result.</li>
            <li> Worked great on my 3 inch long foot scar. Used the full 90 days as recommended. I liked the way it felt, like a subtle layer of protection for my fragile skin.</li>
            <li> At triple the cost of Mederma you might thing this container of silicone guck would work much better.  However, after using it for a while I find not only does it not work better but it doesn&#x27;t even work as well.  In addition, you get this nasty sticky feeling with the silicone sitting on your skin.  If you bump into anything such as clothes, bedding, furniture watch out because this stuff isn&#x27;t coming off.&lt;br /&gt;The only way you can try to get this stuff off is with mineral spirits or a lot of rubbing alcohol.  Either one of them can damage the item, and mineral spirits are extremely toxic.  The only thing Kelo-cote removed was a lot of money.  I would avoid this at all cost!</li>
            <li> Very good product. Recommend that, for the disappearance of scars after surgery.</li>
            <li> I had my most recent (and third) surgery on March 22nd of this year. I had 2 discs in my spine replaced and as a result I have a three inch scar across the front of my neck. My Orthopedic surgeon recommended that I use Vitamin E mixed with sunscreen (since it is in an exposed area). I have been using [[ASIN:B000EGYVQO Vitamin E Oil 1 Stick]] and [[ASIN:B0009F3O90 Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula with Vitamin E, Swivel Stick, .5 oz (14 g)]] two to three times daily since my surgery and it has made a significant improvement in my scar. I wanted to test out Kelo-Cote Scar Gel to see if it would make my scar heal better and/or faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed about this scar gel is that it is really sticky. I have to wash my hands well after applying it &amp; I still feel like it is on my fingers for awhile. It also stays sticky on my neck and does not seem to EVER dry. Luckily this is not an issue with my neck scar.  It does not touch any clothing or anything to where this is an issue. My other scars however are older and on my leg where this product would not work because it would stick to my pants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using Kelo-Cote twice a day for a month (I am pretty religious about applying it since the scar is so visible...I rarely miss an application) I have seen NO improvement whatsoever. I know that it may take longer for this product to work, but I can not risk it. If my incision does not heal properly, I will have a noticeable scar for life. I have decided to return to my Vitamin E &amp; Cocoa Butter sticks (which are great since they don&#x27;t leave your hands sticky!). I would still like to try this on my old scars, but don&#x27;t think it is possible due to the stickiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product unless you have OLD exposed scars to where you have the time to try to improve them without losing anything.</li>
            <li> Noticed major differences in scars from surgery- redness gone, stitches marks shrunk and its still working.</li>
            <li> We used this product twice daily for a month for a my child&#x27;s facial scar (from stitches). Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t help much. 10% improvement tops. Was really hopeful based on the before/after pics in the box. Didn&#x27;t work for us.</li>
            <li> This is my second time using Kelo cote and I think it is the best thing on the market. I tried others including the M derm, which did not work, and I am 100% satisfied.  It smooths out the bulges and ridges of the scar.  You can also use it on old scars which I am trying now along with the foot surgery scar.  It also reduced the redness and swelling enough I could get my shoe on.  I am walking testament of the great qualities of this product. The plastic surgeon also sells it but it is cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have an older scar on my neck from thyroid surgery that is fairly prominent since they had to go in twice. I used this gel faithfully till gone and did not see any noticeable results. Maybe the scar has to be \\&quot;fresher\\&quot;, although the literature provided in the box doesn&#x27;t make a clear distinction about it, that I could discern. It comes in a very small tube, which, to me, makes the price point seem high in comparison to similar products on the market.</li>
            <li> It works! Twice daily apird for 3 months</li>
            <li> Three years ago I had to have plastic surgery around both eyes to correct &amp;#34;droopy eyelids&amp;#34;  and other problems which were interfering with my vision.  The surgeon insisted that I should use Kelo-cote to minimize scarring.  It took time - I think about 2 months - but was completely successful:  today there are no traces of scars whatsoever.  I know that everyone reacts differently both to surgery and to post-op treatment, but, based on my experience, I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> It came in one day instead of two which was great. I can&#x27;t speak on its effectiveness yet since it has been three days, but the coupon inside expired in December 2014. It&#x27;s August 2015. The product says it expires in 2018, though, so I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li> Very upset by that cream, expensive and not that good. Doesn&#x27;t worth it</li>
            <li> shipment is very fast, item is very good</li>
            <li> This stuff if awesome and I can see the results of fading the dark scar rather quickly! I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> The item just arrived. I opened the box and took out the small tube. I peeled off the factory aluminum seal. I began to squeeze out the gel. A small bead began to come out. Then there was a pop (like popping a bubble with bubble gum). Then nothing but air. I continued to squeeze the tube until the gel started to come out again. I squeezed exactly one third of the tube flat, before any more gel was coming out again. This tube cost me almost $30.00, and I get a third of air?!!  And there is a no refund/replace policy for this item!  Grrrrr!</li>
            <li> This product works.  I had a breast reduction and have incisions from under my arms to my cleavage.  I had raised scars as I began to heal.  I started to used this and my raised incisions started to go down within 3 days.  It&#x27;s thick and greasy. You apply a very very thin coat. Let it dry for 5 min.  If it doesn&#x27;t dry, you applied too much. You will start to see a difference.  I did.  I have a medium dark skin tone so I am more likely to keiloid. It&#x27;s $30 at Walgreens for a extremely tiny tube. The size of your index finger. If you use it sparingly like the instructions suggest, you will notice a difference</li>
            <li> A friend recommended I try this on my surgical scar.  It&#x27;s a hyper-tropic scar.  I began using it at 5 months post op and I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 weeks with NO change in my scar at all.  I don&#x27;t want to waste money buying another tube.  So I&#x27;m going to try silicone scar sheets instead.  May work for some but everyone is different.</li>
            <li> Working well so far. This is the third time I&#x27;ve ordered Kelo-Cote at my doctor&#x27;s recommendation.</li>
            <li> it is good for my son&#x27;s scar</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended Kelo-Cote to apply to two scars on my face that had resulted from a fall.  Using the product twice daily has significantly softened the scar tissue.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a good product as I can see a change already  in 3weeks even though I didn&#x27;t use it consistently.  Will keep it up and try longer time!</li>
            <li> Have been using it twice a day for a few weeks and one scar is looking great and the other was a bump and it is almost flat. Works great</li>
            <li> I used this for about 3 weeks and didnt notice any difference. Though my scars are not brand new, I&#x27;ve had them for less than a year. [[ASIN:B001PQBEAI Mederma Scar Gel, 20 Grams]] on the other hand, did help diminish the scars when I switched over to it. Perhaps it was the combination of the 2, but I doubt it.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001PQBEAI Mederma Scar Gel, 20 Grams]] is tried and true.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for 2 month, nothing significantly changed. I have a C section 1 year ago, the scar is not as old as other people were talking about. I will see, maybe it will take long to see a difference</li>
            <li> Love the item works well, my son has a clef lip and we use it for the scars on his lips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product to treat some of my old/new scars for about ten weeks. It is working good though a little bit slowly, the appearance of those scars are now much fainter (compared to the pictures I took before I started to use it).  I will definitely continue to use it and hopefully the scars can disappear before summer.</li>
            <li> Ive only been using this product for a few weeks but am already seeing results on my surgical scar</li>
            <li> This is really a miracle worker. Great doorpost sugery scars. You can see the effects in 2 days!!!!</li>
            <li> Kelo coat made a HUGE difference in my scar healing. I used on 1sh scar revision healed GREAT. After an infection not related to surger I used and after market gel and had keloids return, 2nd scar revision and Dr saying they would probable return ... Nope KELOCOTE coat is working. For visible scars after surgeries are out. This is worth every cent</li>
            <li> This product seems to be working well with smoothing out a 6&amp;#34; scar that&#x27;s a year old. The scar was raised and puffy depending on size of the scar you will need about 3 tubes and use as directed</li>
            <li> This really seems to be working for my son. He had a bad case of cystic acne on his back which left scars. Have been using for about a month now and the scars have definitely improved! It is pricey and I can only find it online. Amazon has the best price.</li>
            <li> Get a different product called Scaraway instead of the product in the picture.</li>
            <li> Cannot recover anything.  Very disappointed! We have been used over three weeks. However, the skin condition still reminds the same.</li>
