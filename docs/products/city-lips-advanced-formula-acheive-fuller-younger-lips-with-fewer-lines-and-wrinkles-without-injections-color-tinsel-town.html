            <li>I felt so gorgeous that night!  </li>
            <li>Not the best plumper but good.</li>
            <li>Happy with product, tingles a bit on my lips</li>
            <li>and it works great.  </li>
            <li>So great, I even bought some for my mom and she loves it too.</li>

            <li>I got CityLips as a gift and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>Amazing results.</li>
            <li>For the cost, I honestly think that the Chapastick Hydration Lock with the CoQ10 works almost as well.  </li>
            <li>it was more effective</li>
            <li>It is more cost effective than having to go to a Dermatologist or Plastic Surgeon whose injections are costly and have to be repeated.</li>
            <li>It gives you lips a healthy conditioning which in turn gives a fuller feeling.</li>
            <li>but i love it</li>
            <li>It was okay.  </li>
            <li>I love the tingly sensation it has on your lips.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>favorite parts of the gloss are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes my lips feel plumper, and if I ever took the time to photograph them I&#x27;m sure I could spot the difference</li>
            <li>I ordered more, gave some for Christmas gifts, and I&#x27;m quite sure to order again.  </li>
            <li>what more could you ask for...</li>
            <li>Mostly picking them up at the drugstore or buying whatever they have on sale at TJ Maxx.</li>
            <li>I never would have paid more than $15 for a lip</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>so they look more inflated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve given many of these as gifts.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s safe</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love what it does to my lips.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Cinnamon oil works better than this.</li>
            <li>Love the look of this product.  </li>
            <li>Love the color.  </li>
            <li>Elegant looking.</li>
            <li>I use it about 3X daily for best results...</li>
            <li>I love how this makes my lips look.  </li>
            <li>They seem fuller and definitely look awesome.</li>
            <li>Love love love it</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>City lips is OK, does not make a huge</li>
            <li>I love the look of modelesque smooth lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My lips did get a blush color to then and felt more full.</li>
            <li>I have a naturally full mouth but love lip plumpers because they get rid of the wrinkles on my lips.</li>
            <li>I am 69 years old; am thrilled with any product that helps!</li>
            <li>Did nothing for me, but probably could do fine for others.</li>
            <li>I wanted to wait until I had used City Lips Advanced Formula for about 2 months before reviewing the product.</li>
            <li>dose not wear off even after eating and drinking makes my lips look hydrated and wrinkle free when u put it on</li>
            <li>I can put it on in the morning and my lips feel comfortable and moisturized until evening.  </li>
            <li>(fortunately handy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the lip plumper DID do was completely smooth the wrinkles from my lips and make them look fuller and poutier.  </li>
            <li>I loved City Lips Advanced Formula, until my last order.  </li>
            <li>My lips seem fuller,  can&#x27;t really tell how much which is good.  </li>
            <li>and they were right!</li>
            <li>hope my review will help someone make the right choice in buying this product!</li>
            <li>It subsided quickly.</li>
            <li>I believe something that is a natural collagen builder could take many months or longer to actually show good results, so I am going to apply City Lips day &amp; night for months and then give a review.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recommendation: I recommend this product for people who havemoney to spend on luxury cosmetics, because this one is really super nice and actually noticeably plumps your lips for a while.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;ll zap them into a state of blissful hydration right quick and it will keep them moisturized longer than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>It makes my lips a little pinker, which is great because I won&#x27;t wear anything that looks like makeup, and I need that</li>
            <li>The only downfall is that it&#x27;s kind of sticky.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>pretty color tho on me.</li>
            <li>u feel a tingle at first and</li>
            <li>Thanks City Lips!</li>
            <li>I asked one of them if I could borrow her lip gloss because the color was really pretty.</li>
            <li>You need to give it about 3 or 4 weeks of daily use to see the increase in your lip size but it does work :)</li>
            <li>I actually think this works....don&#x27;t expect miracles, but my lips are definitely more hydrated and stay that way.  </li>
            <li>have used it for several years and love it.</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>I was very hopeful, Not delusional!</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s no worse than using some over the counter Chap Stick type products, but hardly worth the cost as it is.</li>
            <li>It is more effective and longer lasting for this purpose than Carmex or other</li>
            <li>Liked Victoria&#x27;s Secret lip plumper more</li>
            <li>absolutely should be able to get my money back on this one, I feel scammed..</li>
            <li>so easy to use, and makes such a difference-</li>
            <li>Now my smile is complete thanks to City Cosmetics!</li>
            <li>This is not a dramatic difference, but noticeable.  </li>
            <li>For certain my lips are not drying out.  </li>
            <li>Best lip conditioner - use City Lips and never have dry dull lips again.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a few months now and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>love it lasts all day long !!!</li>
            <li>--I haven&#x27;t really been looking closely though--but</li>
            <li>lips that were harder to press together because there was more lip tissue there to manipulate.  </li>
            <li>, I was going out with some friends one night and when we were getting ready</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t realized it was a lip plumper at first, because normally the lip plumpers</li>
            <li>My lips are even starting to remain wrinkle free for some time after the product wears off.</li>
            <li>and it is also very sticky.  </li>
            <li>It really does the job.</li>
            <li>My lips are not totally thin, but it does make my lips look like I&#x27;ve had a collagen treatment</li>
            <li>And it did ABSOLUTELY nothing for me.</li>
            <li>Got the tinsel pink and its great, just a little sparkle.</li>
            <li>Then I noticed the place where my lips meet had slightly changed, like the shape of my lips had become more like an inflated tire that pulls away from the ground, and</li>
            <li>However, perhaps it&#x27;s too soon; I will give it a little more time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been getting nice compliments lately...</li>
            <li>Normally when my gloss or plumper wears off it leaves my lips drier than even.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t smile enough!</li>
            <li>but this product gives me younger looking lips right away.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After that experience, I bought the clear gloss for everyday wear, and I love it.</li>
            <li>they are soft and moist and feel plump!  </li>
            <li>I have been using City Lips for about 3 weeks consistently, as often as possible.  </li>
            <li>At first like most all other reviews say, I felt a little tingle, not burn.</li>
            <li>but they sent me clear</li>
            <li>It does not stay on like the old formula.</li>
            <li>Wish it really made my lips bigger though.</li>
            <li>Am pleasantly surprised to report that it seems to work.</li>
            <li>I am 62 years old.</li>
            <li>been using this for a few years already, and always appreciate the fabulous results.</li>
            <li>It also does the job  of keeping lips hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>How fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to have a product that does the same thing to my whole</li>
            <li>natural pinkness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2)  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t have old looking lips if you use this - glides on and stays on and lasts</li>
            <li>I also noticed that when the City Lips wore off, my lips remained soft.  </li>
            <li>No stinging to the lips, just a soft plump feel.</li>
            <li>this is a completely fraudulent claim.</li>
            <li>Do not  Waste your money.</li>
            <li>Feels soft on the lips.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if this had any effect but goes on smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>Not even half full only lasted a week with twice daily use.</li>
            <li>If you pull the applicator all the way out of the tube product will collect up near the top of the wand (also bad), so I just pull it out a little to get a dab on my finger from the top of the wand</li>
            <li>Bought this to use as a lip plumper but now can&#x27;t do without it in this extremely dry climate I live in.</li>
            <li>I saw absolutely no results except for the high degree of stickiness.  </li>
            <li>not sure it&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li>Before it was thick and stayed put all day, while keeping your lips full and shiny.</li>
            <li>A little pricey but worth it and lasts a long time.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting nice compliments lately...</li>
            <li> Normally when my gloss or plumper wears off it leaves my lips drier than even.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t smile enough!</li>
            <li> but this product gives me younger looking lips right away.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After that experience, I bought the clear gloss for everyday wear, and I love it.</li>
            <li> they are soft and moist and feel plump!  </li>
            <li> I have been using City Lips for about 3 weeks consistently, as often as possible.  </li>
            <li> At first like most all other reviews say, I felt a little tingle, not burn.</li>
            <li> but they sent me clear</li>
            <li> It does not stay on like the old formula.</li>
            <li> Wish it really made my lips bigger though.</li>
            <li> Am pleasantly surprised to report that it seems to work.</li>
            <li> I am 62 years old.</li>
            <li> been using this for a few years already, and always appreciate the fabulous results.</li>
            <li> It also does the job  of keeping lips hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> How fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to have a product that does the same thing to my whole</li>
            <li> natural pinkness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2)  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t have old looking lips if you use this - glides on and stays on and lasts</li>
            <li> I also noticed that when the City Lips wore off, my lips remained soft.  </li>
            <li> No stinging to the lips, just a soft plump feel.</li>
            <li> this is a completely fraudulent claim.</li>
            <li> Do not  Waste your money.</li>
            <li> Feels soft on the lips.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if this had any effect but goes on smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li> Not even half full only lasted a week with twice daily use.</li>
            <li> If you pull the applicator all the way out of the tube product will collect up near the top of the wand (also bad), so I just pull it out a little to get a dab on my finger from the top of the wand</li>
            <li> Bought this to use as a lip plumper but now can&#x27;t do without it in this extremely dry climate I live in.</li>
            <li> I saw absolutely no results except for the high degree of stickiness.  </li>
            <li> not sure it&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li> Before it was thick and stayed put all day, while keeping your lips full and shiny.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but worth it and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I apply it only once a day (right before getting in bed for the night) and noticed a couple weeks ago that my lips did appear somewhat fuller and less pale.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s just thick, pretty color lipgloss.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> a narrow bit of skin was newly exposed to the air.  </li>
            <li> Very long lasting.  </li>
            <li> I was having serious issues with chapped lips for nearly a year, mainly because I bite my lips when they get dry.  </li>
            <li> Living in Arizona  lends to dry skin and especially lips.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I also recommend it for people with really dry lips--</li>
            <li> When I got my braces off (yes, I AM an adult), my lips were less than average.</li>
            <li> After hearing so much hype, I was really looking forward to City Lips but so far, it is disappointing -- no better than any other kip plumper.  </li>
            <li> I received this as a gift, and was a little incredulous, but I applied it once in the afternoon, then before bed and woke up the next day to lips</li>
            <li> Not what I expected .......doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> i ordered the tinsel town pink color</li>
            <li> It has helped some but not as much as I expected.  </li>
            <li> any other lip glosses</li>
            <li> The new formula is thin and watery and I cannot tell that it has any plumping value whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Its approximately 30 times more expensive than Carmex.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth $35.</li>
            <li> The only thing I can find negative about this product is the cost.</li>
            <li> I like how thick it is, it lasts long and moisturises.</li>
            <li> Use City Lips and never have dry dull lips again.  </li>
            <li> Gives me some plump, and a little color.  </li>
            <li> A waste of money.  </li>
            <li> It seems it was dried out or not filled.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It is very gooey and unpleasant, as well.</li>
            <li> The applicator puts it on way too thick, so I just put a little dab on my finger and spread it on.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback is that it can be difficult to get all of the product out of the tube.</li>
            <li> I feel like I fell for slick marketing of this product.</li>
            <li> This does plump for a little while, but the results are subtle.  </li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> this is the one product i splurge on, immediate plumpness and delicate color seen,&lt;br /&gt;i can&#x27;t travel without it-</li>
            <li> at least read what you wrote.</li>
            <li> Gloss is thick, not sticky.</li>
            <li> It has serious &amp;#34;sticking&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I like subtle changes when I use this type of product.</li>
            <li> I have thin lips and believe me when I say...</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift, and I am addicted to this stuff now!</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this at all and would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Sorry I got sucked into buying it.</li>
            <li> Achieve is spelled wrong</li>
            <li> All it is is an expensive lip gloss.</li>
            <li> disappointed&lt;br /&gt;Too expensive and no results</li>
            <li> They have changed the formula it is now very thin like Vaseline.  </li>
            <li> I usually hate thick, but i like this gloss.</li>
            <li> And a very expensive one at that.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for people to stop and do a double-take and wonder if you&#x27;ve had any work done, you&#x27;re bound to be a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> So disappointed after all the hype about it.</li>
            <li> very, very disappointed with this product.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Product jus feels like,lip gloss.&lt;br /&gt;Bummed ..pretty color tho on me.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t plump - at all.</li>
            <li> Loved it, lips feel nourished and look like they did years ago.  Will definately buy this again.</li>
            <li> I loved City Lips Advanced Formula, until my last order.  They have changed the formula it is now very thin like Vaseline.  It does not stay on like the old formula. A waste of money.  I ordered four tubes which I have to pay to send back.  Beware....it is not the same as it was in 2014.</li>
            <li> Way too Shinny for me at my age. I still like the way it feels on my lips</li>
            <li> Great wonderful product</li>
            <li> Gloss is thick, not sticky. I usually hate thick, but i like this gloss. Got the tinsel pink and its great, just a little sparkle. At first like most all other reviews say, I felt a little tingle, not burn. My lips did get a blush color to then and felt more full. It subsided quickly. Overall, I like this gloss. I don&#x27;t not think I made my lips bigger. It gives you lips a healthy conditioning which in turn gives a fuller feeling. Wish it really made my lips bigger though.</li>
            <li> Happy with product, tingles a bit on my lips but I like that effect.  Wears well, this is my second time purchasing the product so I must like it....</li>
            <li> Not what I expected .......doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> It helps and very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait until I had used City Lips Advanced Formula for about 2 months before reviewing the product. Am pleasantly surprised to report that it seems to work. I apply it only once a day (right before getting in bed for the night) and noticed a couple weeks ago that my lips did appear somewhat fuller and less pale.  This is not a dramatic difference, but noticeable.  Now I will apply it in the morning (after breakfast) and see what happens.  For certain my lips are not drying out.  Recommend you try it!  I am 62 years old.</li>
            <li> love it lasts all day long !!! dose not wear off even after eating and drinking makes my lips look hydrated and wrinkle free when u put it on u feel a tingle at first and then its gone and your lips look amazing !!! i ordered the tinsel town pink color but they sent me clear but i love it</li>
            <li> Not even half full only lasted a week with twice daily use. It seems it was dried out or not filled.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t plump my lips. City Lips is also too slippery and so you can&#x27;t put any lipstick on it afterwards. The lipstick would not stay on and so your lips will have no color.</li>
            <li> It was okay.  Not a buy again item.</li>
            <li> i buy all the rest of my makeup from low cost companies. this is the one product i splurge on, immediate plumpness and delicate color seen,&lt;br /&gt;i can&#x27;t travel without it- so easy to use, and makes such a difference- that i have extra in the car, in my bag, and in the home. been using this for a few years already, and always appreciate the fabulous results.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift, and I am addicted to this stuff now! I love the tingly sensation it has on your lips. It also does the job  of keeping lips hydrated and soft. I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my lips and this stuff works wonders!</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and I really&lt;br /&gt;Love the way my lips look they are soft and moist and feel plump!  I apply a couple Times a day.</li>
            <li> City lips does not work. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now day and night and no difference on my lips what so ever.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have been using it for a while and it works great.  So great, I even bought some for my mom and she loves it too.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift, and was a little incredulous, but I applied it once in the afternoon, then before bed and woke up the next day to lips that didn&#x27;t necessarily look a lot fuller--I haven&#x27;t really been looking closely though--but lips that were harder to press together because there was more lip tissue there to manipulate.  I pressed and unpressed my lips....its the weirdest sensation to wake up with slightly bigger lips.  I applied again and the effect continued.  Then I noticed the place where my lips meet had slightly changed, like the shape of my lips had become more like an inflated tire that pulls away from the ground, and a narrow bit of skin was newly exposed to the air.  How fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to have a product that does the same thing to my whole face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite parts of the gloss are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) It makes my lips a little pinker, which is great because I won&#x27;t wear anything that looks like makeup, and I need that natural pinkness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2)  It has serious &amp;#34;sticking&amp;#34; power.  I can put it on in the morning and my lips feel comfortable and moisturized until evening.  It is more effective and longer lasting for this purpose than Carmex or other any other lip glosses/balms I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) It makes my lips feel plumper, and if I ever took the time to photograph them I&#x27;m sure I could spot the difference too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drawbacks are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) Its approximately 30 times more expensive than Carmex.  (This keeps it from a perfect 5-star rating.  The price would need to drop to $22 or $23 for that.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) The applicator puts it on way too thick, so I just put a little dab on my finger and spread it on.  If you pull the applicator all the way out of the tube product will collect up near the top of the wand (also bad), so I just pull it out a little to get a dab on my finger from the top of the wand (fortunately handy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation: I recommend this product for people who havemoney to spend on luxury cosmetics, because this one is really super nice and actually noticeably plumps your lips for a while.  I also recommend it for people with really dry lips--it&#x27;ll zap them into a state of blissful hydration right quick and it will keep them moisturized longer than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This is one of those products that actually works and stands up to its claims. It does plump lips instant as well as long-term.  It also brings some pigment, or faded color, back to your lips.  I ordered more, gave some for Christmas gifts, and I&#x27;m quite sure to order again.  A little pricey but worth it and lasts a long time.  Thanks City Lips!</li>
            <li> This is my second  City Cosmetics lip plumper. Great product! Lasts a long time. The best plumper ever.&lt;br /&gt;Irene in Arizona</li>
            <li> I got CityLips as a gift and absolutely love it! I was having serious issues with chapped lips for nearly a year, mainly because I bite my lips when they get dry.  This was the thing that made the difference. I like how thick it is, it lasts long and moisturises. I&#x27;ve been getting nice compliments lately... what more could you ask for...</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this at all and would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Best lip conditioner ever.  Use City Lips and never have dry dull lips again.  I wear it with lipstick and without - you can&#x27;t go wrong and lasts a long time.  Best lip conditioner - use City Lips and never have dry dull lips again.  You can&#x27;t have old looking lips if you use this - glides on and stays on and lasts</li>
            <li> I like the texture of the product and the way it looks on my lips.  I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have a naturally full mouth but love lip plumpers because they get rid of the wrinkles on my lips. I love the look of modelesque smooth lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a lot of lip plumpers. Mostly picking them up at the drugstore or buying whatever they have on sale at TJ Maxx. I never would have paid more than $15 for a lip plumper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I was going out with some friends one night and when we were getting ready I asked one of them if I could borrow her lip gloss because the color was really pretty. She let me borrow her City Lips, (it was a colored one, but I don&#x27;t remember the shade.) I hadn&#x27;t realized it was a lip plumper at first, because normally the lip plumpers I try irritate my lips when I put them on.  they also leave a red ring around my lips and this one didn&#x27;t do anything like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What the lip plumper DID do was completely smooth the wrinkles from my lips and make them look fuller and poutier.  I felt so gorgeous that night!  I also noticed that when the City Lips wore off, my lips remained soft.  Normally when my gloss or plumper wears off it leaves my lips drier than even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that experience, I bought the clear gloss for everyday wear, and I love it. My lips are even starting to remain wrinkle free for some time after the product wears off. The only drawback is that it can be difficult to get all of the product out of the tube.</li>
            <li> Before using this product, it seemed like nobody noticed me. When I got my braces off (yes, I AM an adult), my lips were less than average. I heard a rumor that this was the best lip plumper on the market and they were right! Now my smile is complete thanks to City Cosmetics! I can&#x27;t smile enough! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love it.  My lips seem fuller,  can&#x27;t really tell how much which is good.  I like subtle changes when I use this type of product.</li>
            <li> This stuff rocks! It only took a week to start seeing the difference. The tube lasts well over a month! Love, love, love it!!!</li>
            <li> For the cost, I honestly think that the Chapastick Hydration Lock with the CoQ10 works almost as well.  This does plump for a little while, but the results are subtle.  If you&#x27;re looking for people to stop and do a double-take and wonder if you&#x27;ve had any work done, you&#x27;re bound to be a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have found using it at night before bed also helps. Seems to plump up the lines in lips so they look more inflated.</li>
            <li> Bought this to use as a lip plumper but now can&#x27;t do without it in this extremely dry climate I live in. I use it once in the morning and again before bed. No stinging to the lips, just a soft plump feel. I am 67 and my lips are getting thinner but this product gives me younger looking lips right away. I&#x27;ve given many of these as gifts. It&#x27;s not a miracle but it&#x27;s safe and I love it.</li>
            <li> this is a completely fraudulent claim. all it is, is a lip gloss. And a very expensive one at that. I would never recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months now and absolutely love it! My lips feel fuller and it works as a moisturizer as well.  I keep one at work, in my purse and in my makeup bag - I don&#x27;t leave home without it!</li>
            <li> Did nothing for me, but probably could do fine for others.</li>
            <li> It did not do anything it claimed. It  Did not plump lips. Do not  Waste your money. And buy this product</li>
            <li> It has helped some but not as much as I expected.  I hope that with continued use it will continue to improve results.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love what it does to my lips. The only downfall is that it&#x27;s kind of sticky.</li>
            <li> After hearing so much hype, I was really looking forward to City Lips but so far, it is disappointing -- no better than any other kip plumper.  However, perhaps it&#x27;s too soon; I will give it a little more time.</li>
            <li> This is not as advertised.  It did nothing to plump my lips and it is also very sticky.  So disappointed after all the hype about it.</li>
            <li> awesome for the lips!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. It&#x27;s the only lip plumper that has actually kept my lips plump after using it. I put it on before bed. I still have fuller lips during the day now than before I started using it. You need to give it about 3 or 4 weeks of daily use to see the increase in your lip size but it does work :)</li>
            <li> Does not work.  Waste of money. Sorry I got sucked into buying it. Never again.  Cinnamon oil works better than this.</li>
            <li> Does not work.  It is very gooey and unpleasant, as well.</li>
            <li> Love the look of this product.  Love the color.  Very long lasting.  Feels soft on the lips.  Elegant looking. Good purchase</li>
            <li> not sure it&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li> Not sure if this had any effect but goes on smooth and creamy. Liked Victoria&#x27;s Secret lip plumper more it was more effective</li>
            <li> I actually think this works....don&#x27;t expect miracles, but my lips are definitely more hydrated and stay that way.  I will buy again. I am 69 years old; am thrilled with any product that helps!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work for me and caused some skin problems</li>
            <li> City lips is OK, does not make a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;I would of never bought from this seller though. Achieve is spelled wrong its not Achieve its a pet peeve of mine when someone is selling an item and can&#x27;t spell geez at least read what you wrote.</li>
            <li> have used it for several years and love it.It really does the job.</li>
            <li> Living in Arizona  lends to dry skin and especially lips.  City Lips is a great product, I love it!  I use it about 3X daily for best results...would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> very, very disappointed with this product.  I saw absolutely no results except for the high degree of stickiness.  however, amazon has been gracious enough to accept its return prepaid ship.</li>
            <li> All it is is an expensive lip gloss. I feel like I fell for slick marketing of this product. It&#x27;s not worth $35.</li>
            <li> I have been using City Lips for about 3 weeks consistently, as often as possible.  I believe something that is a natural collagen builder could take many months or longer to actually show good results, so I am going to apply City Lips day &amp; night for months and then give a review.</li>
            <li> I love how this makes my lips look.  They seem fuller and definitely look awesome. It tingles when you put it on so I feel like it is working. Love love love it</li>
            <li> My wife likes this product. It is more cost effective than having to go to a Dermatologist or Plastic Surgeon whose injections are costly and have to be repeated.</li>
            <li> This product really works! My lips are not totally thin, but it does make my lips look like I&#x27;ve had a collagen treatment and it lasts all day too. The only thing I can find negative about this product is the cost. It would sell in larger quantities if the price was reduced. Amazing results.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do was it says it would do!!!&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed&lt;br /&gt;Too expensive and no results</li>
            <li> I have had my lip gloss plumper for 2 weeks and I absolutely love it!!&lt;br /&gt;On Easter people actually noticed my lips and said that they look injected wih filler.&lt;br /&gt;Please, if you buy it do not get bumbed out if it does not appear fuller, or feel tingly.&lt;br /&gt;This is like a laquer gloss that protects the lips and plumps them in time.&lt;br /&gt;I use it twice during the day and I apply at night.&lt;br /&gt;I hope my review will help someone make the right choice in buying this product!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping! Product works, just wished it lasted longer.</li>
            <li> Gives me some plump, and a little color.  Will purchase again</li>
            <li> I have thin lips and believe me when I say... I was very hopeful, Not delusional! Just hopeful. I was expecting to see something.. Anything!  And it did ABSOLUTELY nothing for me. I didn&#x27;t feel a difference, nor did I see a difference (my husband concurred) If I could give it NO STARS.. I would.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just thick, pretty color lipgloss.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely should be able to get my money back on this one, I feel scammed..</li>
            <li> It does work, but not with lipstick over it.</li>
            <li> Not the best plumper but good.</li>
            <li> City Lips was great BEFORE they changed the formula. Before it was thick and stayed put all day, while keeping your lips full and shiny. The new formula is thin and watery and I cannot tell that it has any plumping value whatsoever. I guess it&#x27;s no worse than using some over the counter Chap Stick type products, but hardly worth the cost as it is.</li>
