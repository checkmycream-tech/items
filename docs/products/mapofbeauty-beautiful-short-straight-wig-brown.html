            <li>This wig is really great and came way sooner than I planned!</li>
            <li>and this one would have made an ideal addition.</li>

            <li>But,I do love this wig!</li>
            <li>This is a nice wig.</li>
            <li>Honestly it is very cheaply made and if you&#x27;re looking to wear this out and around town or whatever I would advise against it.</li>
            <li>She was really pleased with the price of the wigs.  </li>
            <li>It is healthy shiny , and feels silky..</li>

            <li>I really love this wig.</li>
            <li>I am having so much fun with it!!  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, very good short wig.</li>
            <li>This is such a cute wig and a great bargain.  </li>
            <li>This wig is supposed to be light brown,but ..</li>
            <li>I was expecting what I saw in the picture which is light brownish.</li>
            <li>(light weight) and comfortable.</li>
            <li>this was supposed to be light brown</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s cool</li>
            <li>in a dark room lol.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the right color, shape around the face</li>
            <li>and very realistic!</li>
            <li>Looks REAL!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the first wig I&#x27;ve ever bought, so</li>
            <li>The wig is good but it is VERY short at the back.</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to this wig, because I have a large collection</li>
            <li>Honestly I don&#x27;t really like this wig.</li>
            <li>The product looks and feels like real hair, and looks just like the photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.  </li>
            <li>The top looks a little funny to me, just because I couldn&#x27;t find a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; place for it to sit on my head</li>
            <li>It is actually a medium auburn, which is pretty, but not what I thought I was getting!</li>
            <li>(we can chalk that up to a weird sized head lol).  </li>
            <li>She told me that it feels and looks natural.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little darker than I expected but its still lovely.</li>
            <li>My wife ordered the short straight wig along with the long curly one and she loves them both.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely not one that you could wear everyday, but it&#x27;s fun if you&#x27;re going out...</li>
            <li>The wig I received was a shiny black wig that was not at all the same cut, much shorter in length and bangs.  </li>

            <li> The wig I received was a shiny black wig that was not at all the same cut, much shorter in length and bangs.  </li>
            <li> Not thin at all.. but not too thick, either.</li>
            <li> She has long natural hair to her butt, so it&#x27;s shocking to see her at first, and who knows what she did with all that hair underneath, but that&#x27;s her own secret</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I waited over a month for this item to ship in to have just in time for an event, and it&#x27;s not at all what I expected.</li>
            <li> I assume that it te point of the wig - but just be wary before buying it that it is VERY short and that it may slip up and your natural hair/wig cap may show!</li>
            <li> But I think in terms of a cheap wig, this one&#x27;s not too bad.  </li>
            <li> The color is a little lighter than I originally thought it was going to be, but, all and all it&#x27;s really not that bad.  </li>
            <li> but the one I got was black.</li>
            <li> but it came in black</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very difficult to get right, once it&#x27;s on it really isn&#x27;t flattering, and it sheds like mad.</li>
            <li> There was no contact from the seller, which there usually is if there&#x27;s a delay.</li>
            <li> So I couldn&#x27;t wear it with it. :/</li>
            <li> My camera doesn&#x27;t work very well. :(</li>
            <li> I uploaded a couple pictures, so you can see what I mean about the color of it.</li>
            <li> Sorry they&#x27;re dark..</li>
            <li> Styling was difficult.</li>
            <li> It made me vary sad and angry.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with it.</li>
            <li> just didn&#x27;t like the way it looked on myself, nothing wrong with the product just my&lt;br /&gt;own</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed, and I feel cheated.</li>

            <li> My wife ordered the short straight wig along with the long curly one and she loves them both.  She told me that it feels and looks natural.  She was really pleased with the price of the wigs.  The best part is this company knows how to treat their customers, even if they are overseas they go out of their way to help you.</li>
            <li> This wig is supposed to be light brown,but .. Nope.. It is actually a medium auburn, which is pretty, but not what I thought I was getting! It is very lovely, though,and falls nicely.. Has a lot of hair to it. Not thin at all.. but not too thick, either. It is healthy shiny , and feels silky.. Looks very nice on. and very realistic! It kinda looks like the picture, I guess,, just not the color shown, at all. All in all, it was a good purchase, I think! :)  I uploaded a couple pictures, so you can see what I mean about the color of it. .. Sorry they&#x27;re dark.. My camera doesn&#x27;t work very well. :( But,I do love this wig! &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> Honestly I don&#x27;t really like this wig. It&#x27;s very difficult to get right, once it&#x27;s on it really isn&#x27;t flattering, and it sheds like mad. Honestly it is very cheaply made and if you&#x27;re looking to wear this out and around town or whatever I would advise against it.</li>
            <li> This wig is really great and came way sooner than I planned! It&#x27;s a little darker than I expected but its still lovely.</li>

            <li> Not what I expected. Quality of hair not so good. Styling was difficult. Looks betta on the model than me. Shipping was good.</li>
            <li> The wig is good but it is VERY short at the back. I assume that it te point of the wig - but just be wary before buying it that it is VERY short and that it may slip up and your natural hair/wig cap may show! Otherwise, very good short wig.</li>
            <li> Its a good wig but looks nothing like the picture. It made me vary sad and angry. I had to go and cut it to make it look how I wanted it</li>
            <li> This is a nice wig. Nothing wrong with it. Only prob was I got a wig cap with it and it had a hole in it. So I couldn&#x27;t wear it with it. :/</li>
            <li> I like this wig. it looks like hair and feels like hair but the one I got was black. I was expecting what I saw in the picture which is light brownish. I still like it and I&#x27;m planning on wearing it soon.</li>
            <li> What I received was not at all the wig pictured!  The wig I received was a shiny black wig that was not at all the same cut, much shorter in length and bangs.  it&#x27;s a shame.  I waited over a month for this item to ship in to have just in time for an event, and it&#x27;s not at all what I expected.</li>
            <li> I really love this wig. It&#x27;s the right color, shape around the face and it&#x27;s cool (light weight) and comfortable.</li>
            <li> This is such a cute wig and a great bargain.  I am having so much fun with it!!  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> ... but makes me look like I should sing &amp;#34;Gotta ticket for an aeroplane..&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;The wife loves it and it&#x27;s very cute on her.  She has long natural hair to her butt, so it&#x27;s shocking to see her at first, and who knows what she did with all that hair underneath, but that&#x27;s her own secret I guess.  Looks REAL!</li>
            <li> The product looks and feels like real hair, and looks just like the photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just didn&#x27;t like the way it looked on myself, nothing wrong with the product just my&lt;br /&gt;own personal tastes.</li>
            <li> I purchased this wig a couple months back and it&#x27;s the first wig I&#x27;ve ever bought, so I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.  But I think in terms of a cheap wig, this one&#x27;s not too bad.  The top looks a little funny to me, just because I couldn&#x27;t find a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; place for it to sit on my head (we can chalk that up to a weird sized head lol).

It&#x27;s definitely not one that you could wear everyday, but it&#x27;s fun if you&#x27;re going out...in a dark room lol.</li>
            <li> this was supposed to be light brown but it came in black the bangs are really short not like in the picture</li>
