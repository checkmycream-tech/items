            <li> Delivered on time and product as expected.</li>
            <li> I speak from experience considering my age and the countless other brands I have wasted money on.</li>
            <li> I got what I order, but I feel misled by the picture and other review.</li>
            <li> The eye cream was half empty inside.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not cool in my book.</li>
            <li> However, I was fooled by the picture because I thought the little bag came with the jars.</li>
            <li> These are small jars, but because you don&#x27;t need a lot, it lasts for approx 2.5 - 3 months.  </li>
            <li> Seller should let shoppers know that these items are sample size and a very small quantity in each jar.</li>
            <li> Not a good value for the money you pay.</li>
            <li> However, I was disappointed when I opened the package that what I received were the three items.</li>

            <li> great seller I recomend 100%</li>
            <li> I receive  product when Amazon said I would which is nice. However, I was disappointed when I opened the package that what I received were the three items. I came back and looked and yes, I received what the product listed. However, I was fooled by the picture because I thought the little bag came with the jars. And after reading a customer&#x27;s review I realized I had hoped for the extra lip gloss as well with my bag. It is true I got what I order, but I feel misled by the picture and other review. That&#x27;s not cool in my book. Next time I will pay better attention to product description and not just think what I see seller advertising in picture is I what I am really purchasing.</li>

            <li> I got the advanced time zone day cream and eye cream, but I got the Resilience Lift Firming/Sculpting cream as the third item. I thought it was all 3 advanced time zone creams. It didn&#x27;t say that on the description.</li>
            <li> The creams don&#x27;t have security cover inside. The eye cream was half empty inside.</li>

            <li> Everything was awsome!</li>
            <li> Not the same cream I buy at the store, they were different colors white and a pinkish color</li>
            <li> I got two of the night creams and the eye cream. No day cream.</li>
