            <li>Buying it here is Marvelous and so much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Below*****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am impressed, so far, by Gratiae.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using Gratiae products they always work well and are made with ingredience that I feel good about using .</li>
            <li>It is light weight and feels good going on.</li>
            <li>i have try many brand but it is amazing for me.</li>
            <li>I found this to be an excellent product, absorbed quickly without a greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>So I am now very excited to see that this wonderful product is available here for a still high, but manageable price.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Thus, my conclusion as to this products effectiveness is mostly based on its moisturizing properties.</li>
            <li>Great value, it really works.</li>
            <li>It was okay,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been pleased with the cleanser</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>AND I LIKE THESE PRODUCTS BETTER THAN ANY</li>
            <li>I am glad I can get it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Love the cream.</li>
            <li>I love the product</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and how it feels on my face</li>
            <li>I had more breakouts now than I did as a teenager.  </li>
            <li>What I have found is this product works for me better than anything I have ever used.</li>
            <li>but I love the improvement on my skin and the healthy look of it.</li>
            <li>For the price you would expect something better..  </li>
            <li>My daughter and I love this product line and we love the prices.</li>
            <li>i feel skin have a better feeling for this item.</li>
            <li>This is an outstanding product</li>
            <li>I do no believe the Gratiae products I bought online though Amazon are authentic Gratiae products.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very rich lotion and feel it helps with wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Nothing about this product feels high class or great ingredients.</li>
            <li>I just consider it a finders fee since I wouldn&#x27;t just buy a product like this from a website, but since I tried it first hand at the store, and loved it, now I&#x27;ll always purchase it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing and great to use under make-up to get an extra &#x27;lift&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Wow, how did it get so many good reviews???</li>
            <li>It would br very good for dry skin.</li>
            <li>I see some improvement in fine lines but nothing record breaking.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>I will not purchase it again even though I enjoyed using it because it just isn&#x27;t worth the money you spend.</li>
            <li>The moisture cream is normaly smooth and glossy  </li>
            <li>Originally received as a gift.</li>
            <li>The price is very good too, much less than the one I used to use.</li>
            <li>The shipping was reasonable and the packaging was safe.</li>
            <li>Love it, highly recomended..</li>
            <li>very light, not heavy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very creamy and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>As for the Gratiae website and the prices there -- it makes me laugh.</li>
            <li>I just massage it in and it is magic and it make my skin feel so soft and silky also.</li>
            <li>but it just isn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so rare to find organic products that work well and are affordable.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for over five years and was really excited to find it on Amazon at a tremendous savings over buying it through the normal channels.  </li>
            <li>that is a major luxury department store brand that works better.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for being so effective with price, shipping and we will continue to use your website to order in the future.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other products in this line &amp; have been very pleased.  </li>
            <li>This is just another greasy mess to slap on your face to make you think you are doing something good for you.  </li>
            <li>I like this very much.  </li>
            <li>What I was hoping for was maybe some gentle smoothing of the fine lines that are creeping in around my eyes and smile, and maybe a &#x27;natural glow&#x27;</li>
            <li>At 50 my laugh lines have become very noticable.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with my skin tone and the visual appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>I am using this product on my entire face and neck, and I love the results after a couple weeks.</li>
            <li>recently ordered the product (Oro Instant Firming Serum) that made my sister squeal in Vegas, I will review it - honestly - after I give it a chance.&lt;br /&gt;Until then -- save your money!</li>
            <li>Using coconut oil is the same and works better.</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I have used this Anti Wrinkle Cream</li>
            <li>First, let me start by saying; I went into this purchase without a preconceived notion that this was going to be some miracle cream to rid my face of wrinkles</li>
            <li>and/or make me look many years younger.</li>
            <li>of these products came in a slightly different looking gold top..</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s better price than OROGOLD for the same results.</li>
            <li>I was looking around and found this product at first i was hesitant but</li>
            <li>Like so many others, I bought my first combination of Gratiae products in Las Vegas for a ridiculously high price, even after some proper haggling.</li>
            <li>I had pretty much given up on finding anything that would work within my budget.</li>
            <li>I really like Gratiae and wish I had received this produce.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really  notice that much of a diffference.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t cause olyness.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed and wonder what happened to the eye cream and the moisture cream?</li>
            <li>thanks God I bought this.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product for my wife and it worked very well for her.  </li>
            <li>The bottle lasts several months and makes the skin feel supple and look smooth.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I really like this cream, and I like Amazons price.</li>
            <li>I have normal skin, no blemishes, just laugh lines and early signs of crows feet.</li>
            <li>the jar was only about 1/3 full.</li>
            <li>They worked so well and so quickly, I bought a second jar/bottle of each</li>
            <li>Do you think I received older product at your discounted price?  </li>
            <li>As I have purchased it before from the high priced malls.</li>
            <li>I  had to accept the questionable creams because I loved the price but wonder if it is current and FRESH!</li>
            <li>My solution to this is to leave the hard plastic cover on the top and cut out a small section to get the amount you want with the enclosed small spatula, works great!</li>
            <li>All of the Gratiae products continue to be excellent moisturizers for sensitive, delicate, and middle aged skin (40 years of age).</li>
            <li>This cream makes my skin feel so very soft all day.</li>
            <li>First off product doesn&#x27;t even have ingredients etc on the actual bottle.</li>
            <li>The order arrived as promised, however the jar was a little more than half full of cream.  </li>
            <li>And I am in my early thirties with just few fine lines on my forehead and around the eyes.</li>
            <li>That is a factor for daytime use so I am pleasantly surprised by Gratiae quality.</li>
            <li>I see a marked improvement.</li>
            <li>package seemed old and when coupled with the lack of warming when applied,  </li>
            <li>It definitely reduces the wrinkles and gives skin an much firmer texture.</li>
            <li>Also, I have had some totally unexpected and unsolicited comments on my improved skin tone.</li>
            <li>Oh so much cheaper than what those kiosks in the malls charge for the very same product.</li>
            <li>Marked improvement in skin tone and texture.  </li>
            <li>That is a major factor for me because I do have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It took me about a week to get things back to normal.</li>
            <li>Like a few of the reviews here, I first purchased this cream at a Las Vegas high end store for four times what I paid for it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The product makes your skin feel silky smooth and has a faint fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for approximately 4 weeks (along with the serum) and my skin feels very smooth.  </li>
            <li>I received the product last week, so it is too early to determine if it works.  </li>
            <li>At 50 years old, I was starting to see the signs of aging.</li>
            <li>I am 54 years old and white.</li>
            <li>My skin is very red and sensitive, and the combination of thermal masks and cream I use now helps with that.</li>
            <li>The product also had a settling to it;  a thick paste consistency that never seemed to completely smooth out.</li>
            <li>Most of all, when I look at my face at the end of a 12 hour day teaching 29 kindergarteners, I don&#x27;t look as tired as I feel.</li>
            <li>My skin went from normal to EXTREMELY dry, but breaking out in my T zone.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin on my forehead, and dry to normal skin everywhere else.</li>
            <li>Obviously, I&#x27;m aware that your skin needs a few days to adjust to a new product, but I couldn&#x27;t take the dry, itchiness</li>
            <li>Average I didn&#x27;t really see any changes..  </li>
            <li>As I said, so far, this one&#x27;s a keeper especially when compared to more expensive product lines.</li>
            <li>this was supposed to be a NEW jar but not much in it.</li>

            <li> I was looking around and found this product at first i was hesitant but</li>
            <li> Like so many others, I bought my first combination of Gratiae products in Las Vegas for a ridiculously high price, even after some proper haggling.</li>
            <li> I had pretty much given up on finding anything that would work within my budget.</li>
            <li> I really like Gratiae and wish I had received this produce.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really  notice that much of a diffference.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t cause olyness.</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed and wonder what happened to the eye cream and the moisture cream?</li>
            <li> thanks God I bought this.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my wife and it worked very well for her.  </li>
            <li> The bottle lasts several months and makes the skin feel supple and look smooth.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I really like this cream, and I like Amazons price.</li>
            <li> I have normal skin, no blemishes, just laugh lines and early signs of crows feet.</li>
            <li> the jar was only about 1/3 full.</li>
            <li> They worked so well and so quickly, I bought a second jar/bottle of each</li>
            <li> Do you think I received older product at your discounted price?  </li>
            <li> As I have purchased it before from the high priced malls.</li>
            <li> I  had to accept the questionable creams because I loved the price but wonder if it is current and FRESH!</li>
            <li> My solution to this is to leave the hard plastic cover on the top and cut out a small section to get the amount you want with the enclosed small spatula, works great!</li>
            <li> All of the Gratiae products continue to be excellent moisturizers for sensitive, delicate, and middle aged skin (40 years of age).</li>
            <li> This cream makes my skin feel so very soft all day.</li>
            <li> First off product doesn&#x27;t even have ingredients etc on the actual bottle.</li>
            <li> The order arrived as promised, however the jar was a little more than half full of cream.  </li>
            <li> And I am in my early thirties with just few fine lines on my forehead and around the eyes.</li>
            <li> That is a factor for daytime use so I am pleasantly surprised by Gratiae quality.</li>
            <li> I see a marked improvement.</li>
            <li> package seemed old and when coupled with the lack of warming when applied,  </li>
            <li> It definitely reduces the wrinkles and gives skin an much firmer texture.</li>
            <li> Also, I have had some totally unexpected and unsolicited comments on my improved skin tone.</li>
            <li> Oh so much cheaper than what those kiosks in the malls charge for the very same product.</li>
            <li> Marked improvement in skin tone and texture.  </li>
            <li> That is a major factor for me because I do have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It took me about a week to get things back to normal.</li>
            <li> Like a few of the reviews here, I first purchased this cream at a Las Vegas high end store for four times what I paid for it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The product makes your skin feel silky smooth and has a faint fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for approximately 4 weeks (along with the serum) and my skin feels very smooth.  </li>
            <li> I received the product last week, so it is too early to determine if it works.  </li>
            <li> At 50 years old, I was starting to see the signs of aging.</li>
            <li> I am 54 years old and white.</li>
            <li> My skin is very red and sensitive, and the combination of thermal masks and cream I use now helps with that.</li>
            <li> The product also had a settling to it;  a thick paste consistency that never seemed to completely smooth out.</li>
            <li> Most of all, when I look at my face at the end of a 12 hour day teaching 29 kindergarteners, I don&#x27;t look as tired as I feel.</li>
            <li> My skin went from normal to EXTREMELY dry, but breaking out in my T zone.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin on my forehead, and dry to normal skin everywhere else.</li>
            <li> Obviously, I&#x27;m aware that your skin needs a few days to adjust to a new product, but I couldn&#x27;t take the dry, itchiness</li>
            <li> Average I didn&#x27;t really see any changes..  </li>
            <li> As I said, so far, this one&#x27;s a keeper especially when compared to more expensive product lines.</li>
            <li> this was supposed to be a NEW jar but not much in it.</li>
            <li> Very thick and rich.</li>
            <li> Again, other reviewers may not have much experience in other skin regimes -- I&#x27;m an addict.</li>
            <li> The recent cream I received seemed old and slightly grainy.  </li>
            <li> This is unbelievable and really helps my expression lines disappear...</li>
            <li> The 1.7 OZ container last a long time.</li>
            <li> I thought to myself it must be old because I paid much less for it through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The only down side I&#x27;ve found is that after several months the product starts drying out before it&#x27;s used up, this may be because of the wide opening of the jar, and I live in a very dry climate.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very creamy and thick, so you have to wait a bit before you put on your foundation.</li>
            <li> After application my skin did not feel moisturized but dry.  </li>
            <li> Although my skin had a health glow immediately after, within an hour is was bone dry.</li>
            <li> The 1st one I bought at a kiosk and basically was ripped off.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend--especially if your skin is dry like mine</li>
            <li> My skin is clearer and less red.</li>
            <li> I may be crazy, but I feel like there is a difference in my fine lines.</li>
            <li> Looks as a generic not original?</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> it moisturizes but not good for mature skin.</li>
            <li> I use this and other products of Gratiae.</li>
            <li> so it motivated me to try other Gratiae products.</li>
            <li> I have used other products of Gratiae</li>
            <li> extremely disabpointed will never buy Gratiae on line from Amazon again.</li>
            <li> Some days I am so tired I can hardly drive home, and I will notice my face still looks fresh.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed because I expected more from Gratiae</li>
            <li> The cream was hard, yellow and oily.</li>
            <li> The internal packaging (ie no product brochures which have been in every Gratiae product I ever have bought, no plastic base to hold the jar, diferrent tissue paper than Gratie) was different from other Gratiea products I know werer legitimate because I bought them direct from Gratiae....</li>
            <li> Makes my wrinkles less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I was introduced to the product and now stay with it, purchasing if for less through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Bottom line: not worth the money or time even at the heavy discounted price.</li>
            <li> I was one of those Vegas visitors that get sucked into the little stores in the hotels and malls.</li>
            <li> I went to use the face cream after opening it a few weeks ago, I use other products as well, and it was hard as dried out clay!</li>
            <li> The packaging was different from the expensive creams I bought at the mall.  </li>
            <li> The Gratiae product line is no better or worse than any other skin care line.</li>
            <li> It does soften the hard lines around my mouth and forehead.</li>
            <li> This is a hard to match skin product.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to say if it is reducing wrinkles</li>
            <li> At least not for me, my sister or</li>
            <li> Sorry other users who like it</li>
            <li> Also the cream came out of the bottle, during shipping I guess, and it looked very dirty and smell old</li>
            <li> I have tried Oil of Olay, Neutragena, Roc, Serious Skin Car, Avon, Mary Kay, Boots 7, Secret of the Himalayans, and the list goes on.</li>
            <li> I again use the cream  anyway and think about this poor quality</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it was the wrong product...</li>
            <li> This is not wonderful.</li>
            <li> (has a small ridge around the base of the gold lid)</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very thick and smells awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Could not tell any difference</li>
            <li> Great product. I use this and other products of Gratiae. At 50 my laugh lines have become very noticable. After one application my husband and friends noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> This product tends to make my skin oily. I will use up this jar but I won&#x27;t buy again. It would br very good for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Like a few of the reviews here, I first purchased this cream at a Las Vegas high end store for four times what I paid for it on Amazon. I just consider it a finders fee since I wouldn&#x27;t just buy a product like this from a website, but since I tried it first hand at the store, and loved it, now I&#x27;ll always purchase it on Amazon. The product makes your skin feel silky smooth and has a faint fresh scent. It does soften the hard lines around my mouth and forehead. The only down side I&#x27;ve found is that after several months the product starts drying out before it&#x27;s used up, this may be because of the wide opening of the jar, and I live in a very dry climate. My solution to this is to leave the hard plastic cover on the top and cut out a small section to get the amount you want with the enclosed small spatula, works great!</li>
            <li> *** Update on April 24****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still using this product along with the lifting moisture cream (with volcanic stone) and the lifting serum. All of the Gratiae products continue to be excellent moisturizers for sensitive, delicate, and middle aged skin (40 years of age). I am pleased with my skin tone and the visual appearance of my skin. I see some improvement in fine lines but nothing record breaking. Thus, my conclusion as to this products effectiveness is mostly based on its moisturizing properties. I would recommend this product line based on that conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****Original Post Below*****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am impressed, so far, by Gratiae. I purchased 3 of the facial anti-aging and lifting products, and all 3 are performing well. None of these products, including the Ultrox Expression Marks, are too greasy or oily. That is a major factor for me because I do have sensitive skin. Next, all the products seem weightless, and you can apply make-up over these products without having a blending issue. That is a factor for daytime use so I am pleasantly surprised by Gratiae quality. I am using this product on my entire face and neck, and I love the results after a couple weeks. I will keep using it and see what the long-term results are. As I said, so far, this one&#x27;s a keeper especially when compared to more expensive product lines.</li>
            <li> Not tested on animals and it is a Certified Organic product. Very thick and rich. The 1.7 OZ container last a long time. It takes only a dab to do the job.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and great to use under make-up to get an extra &#x27;lift&#x27;. Especially suited to 35 yo ++ age group. My husband uses it every day too. Feels like velvet. Great value, it really works.</li>
            <li> After application my skin did not feel moisturized but dry.  It didn&#x27;t change the feel or appearance of my skin at all.</li>
            <li> it moisturizes but not good for mature skin.</li>
            <li> I found this to be an excellent product, absorbed quickly without a greasy feeling.  Great price for a great product.</li>
            <li> It was okay, I was a little disappointed because I expected more from Gratiae</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still in the process of using this but it seems very nice. It&#x27;s very creamy and goes on smooth. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my skin. And I am in my early thirties with just few fine lines on my forehead and around the eyes. Wow, how did it get so many good reviews???</li>
            <li> I bought this at my sister&#x27;s recommendation after she had a salesperson show her this in Vegas. Unfortunately, it was the wrong product...the product she loved in Vegas was Oro (see that product for reviews), which visibly gives you a life instantly. The Gratiae product line is no better or worse than any other skin care line. It does not diminish wrinkles. At least not for me, my sister or my boss.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice moisturizer, but so are the Olay products.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy these again. As for the Gratiae website and the prices there -- it makes me laugh. I&#x27;m amazed at what people will buy to look younger -- me included.&lt;br /&gt;This just does not do what it claims. Again, other reviewers may not have much experience in other skin regimes -- I&#x27;m an addict. I&#x27;ll try anything that someone tells me is wonderful. This is not wonderful. It&#x27;s ordinary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have recently ordered the product (Oro Instant Firming Serum) that made my sister squeal in Vegas, I will review it - honestly - after I give it a chance.&lt;br /&gt;Until then -- save your money!</li>
            <li> This is unbelievable and really helps my expression lines disappear...I just massage it in and it is magic and it make my skin feel so soft and silky also.</li>
            <li> The cream was hard, yellow and oily. I had to throw it away.</li>
            <li> I had bought this cream before, but paid a fortune.  Bought it again with Amazon for a great price.  Recommended!</li>
            <li> The order arrived as promised, however the jar was a little more than half full of cream.  I received the product last week, so it is too early to determine if it works.  It does soften my skin.  I purchase the Gratiae purifying cleanser from a kiosk in Florida.  I&#x27;ve been pleased with the cleanser so it motivated me to try other Gratiae products.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  The areas you put it on, it exfoliates.  Use it sparingly, but it works!!  This product exfoliates those areas.</li>
            <li> I really like Gratiae and wish I had received this produce. Even though I don&#x27;t remember getting the product it could have been the mail so I would give it a try again.</li>
            <li> I have used other products of Gratiae and I wanted to try their Ultrox.  I notice the largest difference and the eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li> Best face cream I have ever used.  The price is very good too, much less than the one I used to use.</li>
            <li> This is just another greasy mess to slap on your face to make you think you are doing something good for you.  Using coconut oil is the same and works better.</li>
            <li> Shame on me for trying to save a buck! First off product doesn&#x27;t even have ingredients etc on the actual bottle. States organic etc etc. Nothing about this product feels high class or great ingredients. I went to use the face cream after opening it a few weeks ago, I use other products as well, and it was hard as dried out clay! I read reviews about them trying to sale this product for 100&#x27;s of dollars, THANK GOD I DIDN&#x27;T GET SUCKED INTO THAT!! Do yourselves a favor, spend the money on products that you know of.</li>
            <li> I love it.  I have seen a great improvement in the fine lines and texture of my skin.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a change in their cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.  I have been using it for approximately 4 weeks (along with the serum) and my skin feels very smooth.  I will order this again.</li>
            <li> I AM A POTION PERSON AND I LIKE THESE PRODUCTS BETTER THAN ANY I HAVE USED-WHICH ARE MANY!&lt;br /&gt;THEY FEEL SO GOOD ON MY FACE-I AM 77 SO I DON&#x27;T EXPECT MIRACLES-THESE PRODUCTS COME CLOSEST-&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU-JUDY M. BOWERS</li>
            <li> I like this very much.  Makes my wrinkles less noticeable.  Good price for this.  I am glad I can get it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I have used this Anti Wrinkle Cream but I am very happy with it. I will definitely order it again. It goes on smoothly and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using Gratiae products they always work well and are made with ingredience that I feel good about using .</li>
            <li> The cream arrived leacked, it&#x27;s very thick and smells awful. i&#x27;d never use such thing for my face skin. Sorry other users who like it</li>
            <li> This is a hard to match skin product.  I was introduced to the product and now stay with it, purchasing if for less through Amazon.</li>
            <li> the jar was only about 1/3 full. I love this product &amp; all Gratiae products are the best. this was supposed to be a NEW jar but not much in it.</li>
            <li> Bought this after getting stopped at one of those kiosks in the mall. They had used something that made the wrinkles on the side of my  mouth and between my eyes look smaller. I thought this was the one, but it doesn&#x27;t appear to be the same one. It&#x27;s very creamy and thick, so you have to wait a bit before you put on your foundation. I don&#x27;t really  notice that much of a diffference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with Gratiae Anti Wrinkle Cream.  It came on time also.  I have ordered this product before and have been very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Love the cream. Very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t cause olyness.</li>
            <li> very light, not heavy which is what my face requires and a fraction of the price on the website</li>
            <li> I use this each and every morning, I have problems with rosacea. This product keeps it under control. I love the product</li>
            <li> I was one of those Vegas visitors that get sucked into the little stores in the hotels and malls. I could see the quality of the product, but the price there was unreal. After seeing it on Amazon, I thought I would go ahead and try it at this price. I love it. At 50 years old, I was starting to see the signs of aging. I take really good care of myself, but menopause and time was beginning to show. I see a marked improvement. It was visible in 2 weeks. I will be leaving this same review for all of the products from this company that I order. I think itâ€™s a rip off from the stores, but from amazon its a great price and an effective, quality product.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and how it feels on my face but it just isn&#x27;t worth the price. I have found another product that is about 75 % cheaper that is a major luxury department store brand that works better. I will not purchase it again even though I enjoyed using it because it just isn&#x27;t worth the money you spend. By the time you purchase the Gratiae regimen you could get an alpha hydroxy peel.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the prize..</li>
            <li> A good moisturizer.  I still have wrinkles!</li>
            <li> First, let me start by saying; I went into this purchase without a preconceived notion that this was going to be some miracle cream to rid my face of wrinkles and/or make me look many years younger. What I was hoping for was maybe some gentle smoothing of the fine lines that are creeping in around my eyes and smile, and maybe a &#x27;natural glow&#x27; as some have stated they had after using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was blessed with good genes and for most of my life, I&#x27;ve always had a much younger appearance but in my youthful ignorance, I failed to take care of my skin. I have normal skin, no blemishes, just laugh lines and early signs of crows feet. This product became my biggest enemy and wreaked havoc on my skin. I followed the instructions and attempted to use this for 4 days. The warming sensation lasted for about 3 seconds, something I unsure of, but seems it should have lasted a bit longer..?? Although my skin had a health glow immediately after, within an hour is was bone dry. My skin went from normal to EXTREMELY dry, but breaking out in my T zone. I had more breakouts now than I did as a teenager.  It took me about a week to get things back to normal. Obviously, I&#x27;m aware that your skin needs a few days to adjust to a new product, but I couldn&#x27;t take the dry, itchiness any longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package seemed old and when coupled with the lack of warming when applied,  I questioned the expiration date of this product. The product also had a settling to it;  a thick paste consistency that never seemed to completely smooth out. Bottom line: not worth the money or time even at the heavy discounted price. I&#x27;ll still to Oil of Olay.</li>
            <li> I have tried Oil of Olay, Neutragena, Roc, Serious Skin Car, Avon, Mary Kay, Boots 7, Secret of the Himalayans, and the list goes on. What I have found is this product works for me better than anything I have ever used. I use the Gratiae Replenishing Lifting Serum and Cream in the morning and the Ultrox Expression Marks serum and cream in the evening. With these products being used this way, the deep lines around my jaw line have disappeared by 50-75%. I was and am amazed. I have use this for about 5 weeks. I had pretty much given up on finding anything that would work within my budget. I went to Gratiae&#x27;s website and saw the prices on their products and gave up on affording them until I found them on Amazon. The price here allowed me to try them out. They worked so well and so quickly, I bought a second jar/bottle of each just so I would not run out. A little goes a long way. Most of all, when I look at my face at the end of a 12 hour day teaching 29 kindergarteners, I don&#x27;t look as tired as I feel. Some days I am so tired I can hardly drive home, and I will notice my face still looks fresh. I am 54 years old and white. I have oily skin on my forehead, and dry to normal skin everywhere else.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over five years and was really excited to find it on Amazon at a tremendous savings over buying it through the normal channels.  It definitely reduces the wrinkles and gives skin an much firmer texture.</li>
            <li> Like so many others, I bought my first combination of Gratiae products in Las Vegas for a ridiculously high price, even after some proper haggling. The reason why I don&#x27;t regret it is that for me, it works like nothing else has ever worked. My skin is very red and sensitive, and the combination of thermal masks and cream I use now helps with that. My skin is clearer and less red. Also, I have had some totally unexpected and unsolicited comments on my improved skin tone. So I am now very excited to see that this wonderful product is available here for a still high, but manageable price.&lt;br /&gt;But let&#x27;s face it: people are different, everybody has different skin, and products that work for one person don&#x27;t do anything for someone else.&lt;br /&gt;So find a kiosk where you can try it, and if it works for you as it does for me, buy it here.</li>
            <li> I got started on it when I bought it in Vegas.  Buying it here is Marvelous and so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> The moisture cream is normaly smooth and glossy  As I have purchased it before from the high priced malls. The recent cream I received seemed old and slightly grainy.  I thought to myself it must be old because I paid much less for it through Amazon.  I again use the cream  anyway and think about this poor quality everytime I put it on.  Very dissapointed and wonder what happened to the eye cream and the moisture cream? .All of these products came in a slightly different looking gold top..(has a small ridge around the base of the gold lid) The packaging was different from the expensive creams I bought at the mall.  Do you think I received older product at your discounted price?  I  had to accept the questionable creams because I loved the price but wonder if it is current and FRESH!</li>
            <li> It had the brochure of the brand, but nothing about the cream. Also the cream came out of the bottle, during shipping I guess, and it looked very dirty and smell old</li>
            <li> I bought this in Las Vegas- at a rididulous price.&lt;br /&gt;When I returned home I found it on Amazaon for a FRACTION of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;It is a great product!!!</li>
            <li> This cream makes my skin feel so very soft all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products in this line &amp; have been very pleased.  I use it every morning.  It&#x27;s a very rich lotion and feel it helps with wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Oh so much cheaper than what those kiosks in the malls charge for the very same product. They&#x27;ll RIP UP OFF!!!</li>
            <li> Love it, highly recomended..</li>
            <li> This is as good as any moisturizer nothing amazing about it. It is light weight and feels good going on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this and it&#x27;s better price than OROGOLD for the same results. I was looking around and found this product at first i was hesitant but thanks God I bought this. The shipping was reasonable and the packaging was safe.</li>
            <li> Gratiae is the best moisturizer ever! Love it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my wife and it worked very well for her.  She was very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Have been using it for about a year.  Marked improvement in skin tone and texture.  Originally received as a gift.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so rare to find organic products that work well and are affordable.  Well, Gratiae products have both.  The bottle lasts several months and makes the skin feel supple and look smooth.</li>
            <li> Very Happy , everything shipped  perfect</li>
            <li> I have seen a difference in my skin.  It is hard to say if it is reducing wrinkles but I love the improvement on my skin and the healthy look of it. I apply a vitamin C serum before using and have gotten great results.</li>
            <li> Average I didn&#x27;t really see any changes..  For the price you would expect something better..  I like the lightness of the product.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I may be crazy, but I feel like there is a difference in my fine lines.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love this product line and we love the prices. Thank you so much for being so effective with price, shipping and we will continue to use your website to order in the future.</li>
            <li> i have try many brand but it is amazing for me. i feel skin have a better feeling for this item. you can try it.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream, and I like Amazons price. The 1st one I bought at a kiosk and basically was ripped off.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend--especially if your skin is dry like mine</li>
            <li> I have used it for 3 years already&lt;br /&gt;I do recomend it to anybody&lt;br /&gt;For women over 40 yrs is great</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding product</li>
            <li> I do no believe the Gratiae products I bought online though Amazon are authentic Gratiae products.  The internal packaging (ie no product brochures which have been in every Gratiae product I ever have bought, no plastic base to hold the jar, diferrent tissue paper than Gratie) was different from other Gratiea products I know werer legitimate because I bought them direct from Gratiae....extremely disabpointed will never buy Gratiae on line from Amazon again.</li>
            <li> Looks as a generic not original?</li>
