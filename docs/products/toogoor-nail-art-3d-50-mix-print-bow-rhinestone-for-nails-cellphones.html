            <li>thanks Amanzon!</li>
            <li>But other than that, I love them!</li>
            <li>Love that it is a mixed set!</li>
            <li>Pretty when it sticks</li>
            <li>Bows are much too large for nails but can still be useful for crafts</li>
            <li>They send you 10 of each design and they are the perfect size for real nails or fake nails.</li>
            <li>They look so cool as the color shines through the clear acrylic.</li>
            <li>Well let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m going to be ordering more of these the material is not some cheap little thin paper lol.</li>
            <li>exactly what i expected and more</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>I got mostly the black/white zebra print and the pink &amp; brown leopard color</li>
            <li>The print looks really pixelated.</li>
            <li>It was fast shipping too..</li>
            <li>They are cute but if you want to keep them on your nail for a while, be careful what you do and where you put your hand.</li>
            <li>super cute, but quite a few were damaged :/ still love &#x27;em though and would buy again</li>
            <li>I have yet to use them since they are super flat</li>
            <li>it came kinda late because it did come from far away, but i love them!</li>
            <li>I have them in my daughters stocking for a nice little present</li>
            <li>The only thing is that they are soo flat on the botton that they can easily come off.</li>
            <li>I contacted the seller and fixed the problem and sent me new ones!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know these were clear plastic.</li>
            <li>Stick really well to your nails last a couple of days and they won&#x27;t come of in water.</li>
            <li>Soft type design.</li>
            <li>she&#x27;s only 4 but wanted her nails done soon as I opened the package thanks</li>
            <li>, they look really adorable and they are not so thick</li>
            <li>but the little packet was full</li>
            <li>I love the designs, you get cheetah in different colors, zebra in different colors, and you get different patterns in black.</li>
            <li>Fun little bows for my nail art designs.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t take long and lasts pretty long .</li>
            <li>The only thing I had an issue with is that they are flat on the back and don&#x27;t really &amp;#34;hug&amp;#34; my nails like I want them to</li>
            <li>The bows are clear and the animal prints are like painted on the flat back of the bows.</li>

            <li> They look so cool as the color shines through the clear acrylic.</li>
            <li> Well let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m going to be ordering more of these the material is not some cheap little thin paper lol.</li>
            <li> exactly what i expected and more</li>
            <li> Fast delivery</li>
            <li> I got mostly the black/white zebra print and the pink &amp; brown leopard color</li>
            <li> The print looks really pixelated.</li>
            <li> It was fast shipping too..</li>
            <li> They are cute but if you want to keep them on your nail for a while, be careful what you do and where you put your hand.</li>
            <li> super cute, but quite a few were damaged :/ still love &#x27;em though and would buy again</li>
            <li> I have yet to use them since they are super flat</li>
            <li> it came kinda late because it did come from far away, but i love them!</li>
            <li> I have them in my daughters stocking for a nice little present</li>
            <li> The only thing is that they are soo flat on the botton that they can easily come off.</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller and fixed the problem and sent me new ones!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know these were clear plastic.</li>
            <li> Stick really well to your nails last a couple of days and they won&#x27;t come of in water.</li>
            <li> Soft type design.</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s only 4 but wanted her nails done soon as I opened the package thanks</li>
            <li> , they look really adorable and they are not so thick</li>
            <li> but the little packet was full</li>
            <li> I love the designs, you get cheetah in different colors, zebra in different colors, and you get different patterns in black.</li>
            <li> Fun little bows for my nail art designs.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t take long and lasts pretty long .</li>
            <li> The only thing I had an issue with is that they are flat on the back and don&#x27;t really &amp;#34;hug&amp;#34; my nails like I want them to</li>
            <li> The bows are clear and the animal prints are like painted on the flat back of the bows.</li>
            <li> These are completely flat on the back</li>
            <li> It takes a little effort but I like to sand off the back &amp;#34;sticker&amp;#34; color part off with a nail file/dremel tool/nail drill, leaving them clear, then paint the back with nail polish to coordinate with whatever color</li>
            <li> the bows are flat</li>
            <li> When I got them there were only 40 pieces instead of 50 and the &amp;#34;mix&amp;#34; consisted of pink zebra and the brown cheetah.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected there was no bling at all only plastic bows</li>
            <li> so It Can Get Dry</li>
            <li> Everything what I expected</li>
            <li> I ordered this and got the pink zebra and cheetah print ones I thought it was a mix of all shown however its not.</li>
            <li> 2 had blank paint in small area which is not really noticeable n sum</li>
            <li> and there are NO rhinestones... not worth the $10 i paid for it.</li>
            <li> and they never came in the mail I spent $4 on these bows for them to never come in and be a waste of my money</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re a little small and kinda flat.</li>
            <li> Came in 3 days shy of 3 weeks which was earlier than actual eta.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t snag on every little thing</li>
            <li> I wish they was a little bit thicker.</li>
            <li> A Little Dpt Of Acrylic</li>
            <li> Very plain m expected some bling.  </li>
            <li> When Doinq Your Hair And Any Other Stuff!!...</li>
            <li> so I had to discard a few</li>
            <li> do not fit on nails, the edges stick up</li>
            <li> does not fit well for nail art</li>
            <li> But super cheapy looking. :(</li>
            <li> not sure it was 50</li>
            <li> Poor purchase, as the bows are flat on the bottom instead of curved to fit nails, making them nearly impossible to apply to her nails, and absolutely impossible for them to stay on for any length of time.</li>
            <li> the bad news is it is very low quality plastic and rendered useless since it is too big-</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t look too thick on your fingers.</li>
            <li> This are Not good</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed that it did not have the other 3 designs.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend was very disappointed in this very obvious design flaw.</li>
            <li> so they stick out weird and are basically useless.</li>
            <li> However, theyre not perfect.</li>
            <li> Not sure how these would not be annoying.</li>
            <li> Sorry I hate leaving bad reviews.</li>
            <li> i just will not purchase this again,sorry bad business.</li>
            <li> Way too bulky to ever stay on a nail :(</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Really cute! I will use these often and I will definitely reorder some more. I even saw these pieces in my local nailery.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know they were flat backs figured they would have a curve to fit on nails better. Won&#x27;t even use on my clients.</li>
            <li> Way too bulky to ever stay on a nail :(</li>
            <li> Everything what I expected</li>
            <li> I wish they had a curve to them for your nails but they are super cute! They do look good on your nails.</li>
            <li> Thank you for sending on time and I am so very glad that it was what I needed it made it easy for me</li>
            <li> Kinda big for my nails i have to seal in between the nail and the sides of the bow with acrylic so it doesn&#x27;t snag on every little thing</li>
            <li> Love them. Exactly what I was looking for. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> took a while to receive, but they are very pretty and colorful!</li>
            <li> it came kinda late because it did come from far away, but i love them! they&#x27;re the perfect size for my nails, and they have such cute designs :)</li>
            <li> Good mix cant wait to use</li>
            <li> Great variety of bow. Haven&#x27;t had the chance to use them but they look great and the quality of the bows seems good also. Fast delivery</li>
            <li> Cute. For my youngest. She loves them.</li>
            <li> These are completely flat on the back so they stick way out on the nail. I got mostly the black/white zebra print and the pink &amp; brown leopard color, I wish there were more of the checkerboard pattern. It takes a little effort but I like to sand off the back &amp;#34;sticker&amp;#34; color part off with a nail file/dremel tool/nail drill, leaving them clear, then paint the back with nail polish to coordinate with whatever color I do my nails in. They look so cool as the color shines through the clear acrylic.</li>
            <li> Cute little bows looks good on fingers wish they were smaller. Wish they could be a tad smaller on the nail.</li>
            <li> I ordered them a month a go and just got them. there a bit smaller then they look in the picture</li>
            <li> Tooo many of the same thing!</li>
            <li> I thought theses were the cutest thing ever, I love them!! Will definitely be getting more of these bows. Thanks !!</li>
            <li> These bows are very cute. I love the animal print and the size. I haven&#x27;t tried them yet. I can&#x27;t wait to try them I know they will look great</li>
            <li> Works great. Will buy again!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter LOVES these.They are SO CUTE!!!! I&#x27;m sure we will have to order more after she goes through these :)</li>
            <li> Too big for my nails. The product is very nice just the size is not right for me. Might be different for you if you like largest bows.</li>
            <li> These are ok. Not as nice as I had expected. But they were for my daughter anyways and she likes them. The print looks really pixelated.</li>
            <li> Love it. Would get more</li>
            <li> Ehhhh I didn&#x27;t know these were clear plastic. Perfect for little girls or their cell phone cases. But super cheapy looking. :( Sorry I hate leaving bad reviews.</li>
            <li> I ordered these bows and they are so cute! They send you 10 of each design and they are the perfect size for real nails or fake nails. I will be ordering me more of these in the future. I love the designs, you get cheetah in different colors, zebra in different colors, and you get different patterns in black. Love love love them!</li>
            <li> This are Not good you can not use them for yor nails, they will not stick. With or without glue. Another mistake buying these. i did pay enough so i am not asking for my money back i just will not purchase this again,sorry bad business.</li>
            <li> Got 10 each of 5 very cute patterns. Came in 3 days shy of 3 weeks which was earlier than actual eta. They&#x27;re tiny n very adorable. 2 had blank paint in small area which is not really noticeable n sum had a tiny amount of xtra plastic that needed to b filed off..so all n all DEF worth money since still 100% usable. Would recommend for sure.</li>
            <li> Some of these bows have miss prints or blotted prints so I had to discard a few</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how to apply them. There&#x27;s nothing included to attach them to your nails, nor are there any instructions.</li>
            <li> Cute. Bigger than I thought.</li>
            <li> Cute bows.  My clients love these on their nails and they look really nice I can really charge them a lot because the quality is great.</li>

            <li> I like this buy, they look really adorable and they are not so thick so they don&#x27;t look too thick on your fingers. The only thing is that they are soo flat on the botton that they can easily come off. But it was a good ser of different styles.</li>
            <li> I thought the variety was nice. When I got them there were only 40 pieces instead of 50 and the &amp;#34;mix&amp;#34; consisted of pink zebra and the brown cheetah. I was a little disappointed that it did not have the other 3 designs.</li>

            <li> I love them. Cute . Thank you</li>
            <li> not sure it was 50 but the little packet was full the bows are flat so i rather use it for my phone unless u have acrlyic for theses bow but i like them</li>
            <li> Was bought as gift for girlfriend. Poor purchase, as the bows are flat on the bottom instead of curved to fit nails, making them nearly impossible to apply to her nails, and absolutely impossible for them to stay on for any length of time. Girlfriend was very disappointed in this very obvious design flaw.</li>
            <li> so cute. i love all the design</li>
            <li> These bows are ok. Only received 45 pcs.</li>
            <li> I loved them, shipped within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I just got these today and my neighbors little girls loved the design I made with them  surely a must buy</li>
            <li> These bows are so darn cute! 50 bows for about $2.... Yes please! They are the perfect size for most nails. The only thing I had an issue with is that they are flat on the back and don&#x27;t really &amp;#34;hug&amp;#34; my nails like I want them to and they&#x27;re plastic so you can&#x27;t bend them to fit better. But other than that, I love them!</li>
            <li> I love it and can&#x27;t wait to use them on my daughter. Great buy and I will be purchasing again for sure.</li>
            <li> Not sure how these would not be annoying. I have yet to use them since they are super flat so they stick out weird and are basically useless.</li>
            <li> I have ordered these a second time. Love the look on the nail and just the right size to use</li>
            <li> they did nt stick to nails or phone case the white backing would peel off.. bigger than i thought they would be.&lt;br /&gt;took forever and a day to get to me</li>
            <li> Perfect size for the nails , great look all my customers love it ! Easy to glue doesn&#x27;t take long and lasts pretty long . Would recommend</li>
            <li> As a nail artist these are the perfect finishing touch. I was very pleased with the quality and variety. I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I received these and they are so cute exactly what I wanted for my collection.</li>
            <li> These look so cute! I have them in my daughters stocking for a nice little present</li>
            <li> Fun little bows for my nail art designs.</li>
            <li> Bows are cute and order arrived quicker than stated timeframe.</li>
            <li> I like the animal prints bows. they&#x27;re a little small and kinda flat. I wish they was a little bit thicker. but they are easily to apply on nails.</li>
            <li> These are so adorable, look just like the picture, love the feel of them. Soft type design. Sure dress up the nails. And don&#x27;t look cheap</li>
            <li> my customers love these. they say theyre cute and they go well with designs. However, theyre not perfect. The bows are clear and the animal prints are like painted on the flat back of the bows. Out of 50, maybe 5 of them, the prints were kind of runny or didnt cover the entire bow. But its still a great deal. Nothing can be perfect 100%.</li>
            <li> So cute, I don&#x27;t even want to use them! Worth the money for sure. would recommend for any nail art lover</li>
            <li> I just got these over the weekend and I absolutely LOVE them! They&#x27;re perfect!</li>
            <li> Nice but will fall off nail</li>
            <li> Love the assortment.  Something different to offer my clients.  Can mix and match. Love that it is a mixed set!</li>
            <li> They are so Nice and Cute.  Will order again soon. Customers will love them nice shape and colors they are all in pairs.</li>
            <li> Ok so I ordered these they have no rhinestones they are printed bows look too simple so I&#x27;m not putting these on my nails</li>
            <li> Thanks they are so pretty can&#x27;t wait to use got this item super early before deliver date my daughter was more excited then me n she&#x27;s only 4 but wanted her nails done soon as I opened the package thanks</li>
            <li> These are adorable! I&#x27;ve put them on my phone, nails, vape pen, and anything else.  (:</li>
            <li> they are cute, various designs, they are bigger than I thought, but I think they still look good on nails.</li>
            <li> I recommend to buy nail glue to help keep the bows on longer. They are cute but if you want to keep them on your nail for a while, be careful what you do and where you put your hand.</li>
            <li> there pritty....happyyyy</li>
            <li> I get alot of compliments for these bows!! i completely love them!!!</li>
            <li> Love these. Have not used them in myself cuz I don&#x27;t like bulky jewels on my nails. But they are super cute!</li>
            <li> I CHOSE MY RATING OF 5 BECAUSE I LOVE THEM AND THE AMOUNT YOU RECIEVE FOR THE MONEY IS AWESOME</li>
            <li> Well let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m going to be ordering more of these the material is not some cheap little thin paper lol. It also came on time yay. I think these are adorable.</li>
            <li> Not the original bows I waa looking for however they are so beautiful... I&#x27;m glad I ordered them</li>
            <li> Bows are much too large for nails but can still be useful for crafts</li>
            <li> Nice and easy to use!</li>
            <li> awesome look â€“ awesome price!</li>
            <li> If You Want It To StiCk Lonqer I Recommend You All To Use Acrylic To Make Them Stay!! If You Use Glue It Wont Stay As Lonq As When You Ise Acrylic For It To Stay!! So I Recommend To Place A Little Dpt Of Acrylic And Then Put The Bow Ontop Of The Acrylic so It Can Get Dry And You Wont Have Any Problems By It Fallinq Off When Doinq Your Hair And Any Other Stuff!!...</li>
            <li> Pretty when it sticks</li>
            <li> These bow are just toooo cute!!! I would definally buy them again!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected there was no bling at all only plastic bows</li>
            <li> the good news is it shipped fast. the bad news is it is very low quality plastic and rendered useless since it is too big- does not fit well for nail art and there are NO rhinestones... not worth the $10 i paid for it.</li>
            <li> super cute, but quite a few were damaged :/ still love &#x27;em though and would buy again</li>
            <li> My teenagers love these</li>
            <li> Very plain m expected some bling.  There was none.</li>
