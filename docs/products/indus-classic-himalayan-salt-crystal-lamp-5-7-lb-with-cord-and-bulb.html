            <li>Light mechanism is very cheap.</li>
            <li>However, it is hands down the best nightlight we have ever owned for the kids.</li>
            <li>Fine for me but not if your are OCD about that sort of thing.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re each a unique work of art that can go with almost any kind of interior decor, from \\&quot;neo-hippie\\&quot; to Museum Modern.</li>
            <li>I have a few more rooms in the house that would benefit from the beautiful amber glow of salt lamps.    </li>
            <li>When I got it as a gift last week I was very pleased with it: the assembly is quick and easy, then you just plug in and enjoy.</li>
            <li>These lamps really make a stunning addition to any home, but on top of that, they really do have health benefits.</li>
            <li>One could probably not be able to read the books with this light because it is very dim</li>
            <li>Love it , darker than I thought but its fine its light orange not white</li>

            <li>Healing properties or not, this lamp is very unique and because it is made of natural salt</li>
            <li>Calm, gentle light for them where the room is still light enough that they are not scared and we can easily move around in it yet</li>
            <li>This came super fast.</li>
            <li>Overall, I love the ambience.</li>
            <li>It had nice pink color.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>The only thing I did notice is that if you leave it off for more than two or three days straight it will shed some &amp;#34;salt dust&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I would give it one star for false advertisement but lamp is really beautiful and it helps with my allergies.</li>
            <li>It has beautiful wood base and it was very easy to assemble.  </li>
            <li>This lamp really lightens the mood in a room.</li>
            <li>it really does seem to work.</li>
            <li>I really like that feature because that way you can leave the lamp on all night but with a night light-like setting.</li>
            <li>Overall, I have to say I enjoy this lamp</li>
            <li>Oh, and if you&#x27;re wondering if this lamp is really salt...</li>
            <li>The lamps emit negative ions when warm, which bond to and counteract the positively charged dust and allergens in the air, as well as positive ions produces by computers.</li>
            <li>I also have a tea lite holder, but it doesn&#x27;t work as well, especially since the candle is emitting smoke into the room that your trying to clean.</li>
            <li>I really do feel more energized and less groggy or depressed.</li>
            <li>I have no idea if any of the other brands have dimmer cords, but as far as I&#x27;m concerned it&#x27;s a must-have feature so that the user can get just the right amount of light.</li>
            <li>I found mine at Home Goods though for $15, which is a little better than these after shipping is tacked on to the price.</li>
            <li>Now the lamp works again, except there&#x27;s no dimmer control on the new switch.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it and walked into my room I could instantly feel the calming affect.</li>
            <li>I chose this salt lamp because so many reviews of the other salt lamps warned of the faulty switches and lights that suddenly quit working.</li>
            <li>Lamp arrived quickly via US Post and it was carefully packaged.  </li>
            <li>I keep one in my room near my laptop and always have it turned on while</li>
            <li>But I like it so much that I am getting a second one that I will place in the living</li>
            <li>Never go into my bedroom in the dark, such a relaxing light to sleep by.</li>
            <li>I guess I could have soldered it back, but instead I wired a new on/off switch onto the cord.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After about a week of daily use, the light flickered on and off a few times and then stayed off.</li>
            <li>However, I just received 3 more for Christmas (2013) and all of them are in poor condition.  </li>
            <li>I was disappointed that it wasn&#x27;t more crystal/white/clear,but it&#x27;s still very pretty.</li>

            <li> but when I got them they were pail pink.</li>
            <li> like I  was the other salt lamps I got on amazon.</li>
            <li> It looks like all the other salt lamps in</li>
            <li> I have noticed areas where it has lines of black in it.  </li>
            <li> This one had no such reviews, and I hate to be the first, but</li>
            <li> and it has yet to give me any trouble.</li>

            <li> This lamp really lightens the mood in a room. The first time I used it and walked into my room I could instantly feel the calming affect.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2. Showing white in the ad but when I got them they were pail pink. Not what I wanted at all but used them as a gift because of the hassle of returning them. Was not thrilled at all with them like I  was the other salt lamps I got on amazon.</li>
            <li> I already have one so I couldnt miss opportunity to get some more and in this case two for the price of one. Well I am still waiting on the second one and to be honest I dont think it will arrive. It was too good to be true so pay attention to what they send you in order confirmation .According to that I m missing one lamp and a small bag of himalayan salt. I would give it one star for false advertisement but lamp is really beautiful and it helps with my allergies.</li>
            <li> i leave it plugged in all the time.  makes a super-nice glow in the room.  i would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I chose this salt lamp because so many reviews of the other salt lamps warned of the faulty switches and lights that suddenly quit working. This one had no such reviews, and I hate to be the first, but here it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a week of daily use, the light flickered on and off a few times and then stayed off. I&#x27;ve wired lamps before, so I unscrewed the dimmer switch box on the cord, and saw that one of the soldered wires had come loose. I guess I could have soldered it back, but instead I wired a new on/off switch onto the cord. Now the lamp works again, except there&#x27;s no dimmer control on the new switch. Maybe I&#x27;ll swap that out at some point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I&#x27;m happy with the lamp. The light that it gives off is pleasant and calming- it really does seem to work. I&#x27;d even buy another one- it seems I&#x27;m taking my chances with badly wired lighting no matter which salt lamp I choose, and aesthetically, this one is awesome.</li>
            <li> I have owned my salt crystal lamp about a month now.  I really Love it!  I keep it on in my bedroom.  I have noticed areas where it has lines of black in it.  I hope it is collecting all the negative energy in the air.  Never go into my bedroom in the dark, such a relaxing light to sleep by.</li>
            <li> This came super fast. It looks like all the other salt lamps in that the color is more pink/coral. I was disappointed that it wasn&#x27;t more crystal/white/clear,but it&#x27;s still very pretty. Light mechanism is very cheap. Need to take care when replacing bulb. Also,the base is a little small and off center. Fine for me but not if your are OCD about that sort of thing. Overall, I love the ambience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d wanted one of these lamps for years, just because they look so interesting. When I got it as a gift last week I was very pleased with it: the assembly is quick and easy, then you just plug in and enjoy. The incandescent bulb takes about 10 minutes to start really warming the salt so that it can emit the negative ions into the air. Honestly? Even if that turns out to be a bunch of bunk, I&#x27;m getting another one. They&#x27;re each a unique work of art that can go with almost any kind of interior decor, from \\&quot;neo-hippie\\&quot; to Museum Modern. I have a few more rooms in the house that would benefit from the beautiful amber glow of salt lamps.    By the way, this model comes with a white cord that includes a dimmer control. I have no idea if any of the other brands have dimmer cords, but as far as I&#x27;m concerned it&#x27;s a must-have feature so that the user can get just the right amount of light. At its brightest, my salt lamp makes a cheery night light, at the dimmer end it&#x27;s subtle and pretty. Sometimes, that&#x27;s all you want.</li>
            <li> These lamps really make a stunning addition to any home, but on top of that, they really do have health benefits. The lamps emit negative ions when warm, which bond to and counteract the positively charged dust and allergens in the air, as well as positive ions produces by computers. I keep one in my room near my laptop and always have it turned on while im working. I really do feel more energized and less groggy or depressed. I found mine at Home Goods though for $15, which is a little better than these after shipping is tacked on to the price. I also have a tea lite holder, but it doesn&#x27;t work as well, especially since the candle is emitting smoke into the room that your trying to clean. It does make the room more cozy on cold nights though.</li>
            <li> Got this for a gift and she uses it all the time. Would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had received one of these years ago and have been very happy with.  However, I just received 3 more for Christmas (2013) and all of them are in poor condition.  The bases aren&#x27;t constructed well. They all sit wobbly, because the cord sticks out too far and has been screwed to the base that way.  On one, the screws are rusted.  On another the base doesn&#x27;t appear that it was ever sanded, not even to remove the really rough edges.  It actually has chucks of wood partially attached that shouldn&#x27;t be there.</li>
            <li> I love the dimmer light and have received many compliments about it.</li>
            <li> I bought this after viewing a similar lamp at a co-worker&#x27;s desk.  We are very pleased!  Product is of good quality and effect is awsome!</li>
            <li> I question any \\&quot;health\\&quot; benefits of this lamp. However, it is hands down the best nightlight we have ever owned for the kids. Calm, gentle light for them where the room is still light enough that they are not scared and we can easily move around in it yet dark enough they can fall asleep.</li>
            <li> Does not match photo not silver and base was dark wood. So it does not match room where I needed to put it as it glows orange.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely beautiful, and good price compared to the prices in stores.</li>
            <li> Last year I was in Chicago where I had massage in a therapeutic room where walls were covered with Hymalayan salt.  It was at that time that I learned that this type of salt has healing properties.  Therapist told me it was his favorite room and he felt that not only his clients were benefiting from inhaling the (salty) air but he also was benefiting from it as he was working on their bodies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most recently I saw ad about Hymalayan Salt Crystal lamps.  I will admit I shopped around because I found lamps to be expensive especially after shipping and handling charges were added to the purchase.  However, at one point I just knew that I had to have one no matter what, so I went ahead and ordered one via Amazon.  Lamp arrived quickly via US Post and it was carefully packaged.  It has beautiful wood base and it was very easy to assemble.  Once I turned on the light it has soothing dim light perfect for relaxation.  One could probably not be able to read the books with this light because it is very dim but it is definitely soothing. For people who want to relax or meditate it is wonderful addition to any room.  I keep my lamp in the bedroom, next to my bed table.  But I like it so much that I am getting a second one that I will place in the living room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lamp also came with a small sample of Hymalayan edible salt.  It had nice pink color.  I have not cooked with it yet but I will give it a try.  Healing properties or not, this lamp is very unique and because it is made of natural salt it is a piece of artwork in itself.  I may even buy some as a Christmas presents and give them away to people I truly care about.</li>
            <li> Love it , darker than I thought but its fine its light orange not white</li>
            <li> I ordered this lamp because I was hoping to reap some of the potential health benefits one gets from the negative ions a salt lamp releases. Well I have not noticed any change in how I feel, however this is a very beautiful lamp. It arrived on time, in one piece, and even came with a packet of Himalayan salt to use on food. Before plugging it in I could see that the lamp was pale pink in color with a shape and size much like the seller&#x27;s photo. Once lit up, this lamp exudes a really lovely pink-orange glow. You even can control the brightness with a dimmer located on the cord. I really like that feature because that way you can leave the lamp on all night but with a night light-like setting. Overall, I have to say I enjoy this lamp and it gives my bedroom a nice earthy ambiance which I have received compliments on. I leave it on all day and sometimes all night and it has yet to give me any trouble.The only thing I did notice is that if you leave it off for more than two or three days straight it will shed some &amp;#34;salt dust&amp;#34;. Although to me the dust is not a big deal and I simply wipe it away. Oh, and if you&#x27;re wondering if this lamp is really salt... I did give it a lick and it is. ;)</li>
