            <li> It&#x27;s very long with a Spanish curl.</li>
            <li> Love the wig , just wish the clips were bigger and longer, it made it a little difficult.</li>
            <li> and it could last you up to roughly 1&amp;1/2 to 2 months.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely long- an attention grabber.  </li>
            <li> It comes soft and fluffy like to the touch</li>
            <li> 2014 long curly hair&lt;</li>
            <li> Omg came faster than expected</li>

            <li> so I know in about 1 week and a half</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn it everyday since i purchased it.  </li>
            <li> a total waste of money!!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it although I did make her cut it to bra strap level and thin it out a bit.</li>
            <li> Looks too fake and tangles like crazy</li>
            <li> useless to me!</li>
            <li> the hair is insanely shinny and feels so fake!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a nice wig.  You have to treat it right and it could last you up to roughly 1&amp;1/2 to 2 months.  The texture will change as it gets older, however.  You must use a softening agent, like moisturizing sprays etc.  It is extremely long- an attention grabber.  I am tall and it is the length of my back and very full.  It is worth the price at under $30. I will continue to purchase this unit.</li>
            <li> I loved it, it was a beautiful wig however it didn&#x27;t last long. Maybe because of my lack of caring for it or me experimenting with it but the over all product is great just wish i knew more about the up keep.</li>
            <li> It was absolutely beautiful.  It arrived in 2 days which I thought was VERY fast. It&#x27;s as long and as full as it is in the picture..ive had it for a while now and it is still gorgeous..I&#x27;ve worn it everyday since i purchased it.  the back gets tangled quickly but it is synthetic so I expect as much..I suggest hanging it up at night, it will last longer.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! I love this unit. It doesn&#x27;t shed as much as i thought it would. Nothing bad to say about it, loves it!</li>
            <li> YUK!!!! this wig is awful!! i ordered the 613 color and oh my goodness its white like not even platinum .. its just white as white can be!! useless to me! the hair is insanely shinny and feels so fake! it feels like doll hair curly doll hair! a total waste of money!!!! just going to throw it away! i would not recommend this to anyone!!!</li>
            <li> Looks too fake and tangles like crazy</li>
            <li> Omg came faster than expected &amp; I love love love! I wanna buy 3 more for summer time ! Blends perfect with my hair !</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s a steal!  It&#x27;s big hair.  A Lil much but I cut and styled it and it looks so real!  It&#x27;s bouncy not heavy or hot.  Great quick summer time hair  love it  will order this again</li>
            <li> If you love Big hair, this is the hair for you! Many compliments were received.</li>
            <li> I love,love,love  my wig it&#x27;s everything and more!!!!Will purchase another wig or wigs in the near future!!! Its a great purchase!!! #no regrets!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this hair on a Thursday and recieved it the following Monday. I absolutely love it. The length is more than I had thought but that makes it so much better lol, it comes down my back almost touching my behind. It&#x27;s not as poofy as the picture makes it look, but being that it&#x27;s summer I&#x27;m taking that as a good thing. It comes soft and fluffy like to the touch (of course it&#x27;s synthetic so I know in about 1 week and a half or so it will no longer feel that nice) and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> The hair looks great.  My daughter loves it although I did make her cut it to bra strap level and thin it out a bit.</li>
            <li> This hair is amazing, I love it!!!!!!! Yaaaas! People think this is real, hahhahaha i look so good yaaaaaaas</li>
            <li> I always buy this hair</li>
            <li> Not only is she pretty but she is better looking in. Person love her plus I brought her three times that&#x27;s how good she is even the white people love her they stayed coming up to me like omg your is beautiful I would say oh thank you I brought her from amazon then they would look at me like omg I thought that was your girl lmao so you know it&#x27;s the bomb    Another winning never seem to upset me</li>
            <li> Love the wig , just wish the clips were bigger and longer, it made it a little difficult. I had to add bobby pins</li>
            <li> Shipping was so fast. Came within 4-5 days. I absolutely love this wig. This is my 3rd time ordering and it won&#x27;t be my last. It&#x27;s very long with a Spanish curl. Great to just throw on. It&#x27;s definitely my go-to wig. Love this unit.</li>
            <li> think....diana ross...&lt;br /&gt;think....ciara from the &amp;#34;get up&amp;#34; video.&lt;br /&gt;think..... rihanna right now... 2014 long curly hair&lt;br /&gt;very soft&lt;br /&gt;kinda tangles (not suprising cuz its synthetic)&lt;br /&gt;very very very long.!!!! im 5&#x27;5 105 petite...its all the way down to my butt&lt;br /&gt;already layered&lt;br /&gt;TIP: KEEP THE NET THEY GIVE YOU.
