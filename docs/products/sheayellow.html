            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>I primarily use it on my face at night and my skin looks and feels great in the morning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>To each his (or her) own.</li>
            <li>then when I took it out of the packaging to inspect it, the bottom had 4 nice sized spots of mold on it..</li>
            <li>Make our own liquid bath soap without all the chemicals or $$.</li>
            <li>I tried it out on its own by melting a bit in my hands and applying to my affected areas.</li>
            <li>I have shared it with some friends and they are really loving it too.</li>
            <li>The smell kind of reminds me of cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>Nice product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just beginning to make my own skin care items.  </li>
            <li>Great texture and easy to blend into homemade body butter recipes, leaves my skin incredibly smooth and glowy!  </li>
            <li>It smells so good and is easy to work with.</li>

            <li>This was my first experience making lotion &amp; it easy &amp; turned out great!</li>
            <li>Great natural shea butter, I use their recipes (and my own variations) to make great skin products that I use and give as gifts everyone seems to love.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This really is the best shea butter on the market and the owner, Isabella, is a very sweet woman.</li>
            <li>BY FAR THE BEST SHEA BUTTER</li>
            <li>This is the best quality Shea Butter I have used so far.  </li>
            <li>Perfect as an all natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I love BSB!ere else for my Shea butter needs :) I love BSB!</li>
            <li>I primarily bought this for my hair since I heard so many good things about shea butter.</li>
            <li>This shea butter has a light pleasant smell and liquifies easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very smooth and unlike Shea butter</li>
            <li>I love it, my skin loves is and my hair loves it..</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that it comes with a recipe book.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>Thank you for making such a delightful product!</li>
            <li>love it  looking forward using it in soaps etc.</li>
            <li>I must say, I absolutely LOVE this Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>, Better Shea Butter&#x27;s customer service is OUTSTANDING.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be going anywhere else for my Shea butter needs :)</li>
            <li>I could not be more satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Perfect in every way, I will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li>Not just ethnic skin, like my own, which is light brown.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I use it with my favorite Shea butter lotion as an additive and alone in my hair and my daughters hair as a pre-shampoo oil treatment.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  </li>
            <li>After everything was melted I stuck it in the fridge until it solidified on the top and sides.</li>
            <li>The day after, his skin already looked better.</li>
            <li>However, my intended use for the shea butter was to make own sunblock (of which a recipe is included in the free e-book).  </li>
            <li>The product came fast and in great condition.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>i will be buying more.</li>
            <li>The Shea butter was nicely and securely  packaged.</li>
            <li>Because I don&#x27;t feel safe using this product as an expectant mother, she offered to refund my order.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li>so worries that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it all in 2yrs</li>
            <li>, I spilt it up and gifted to two close friends who are also enjoying it.  </li>
            <li>The company also seems to be great to work with, they are very responsive to questions via email.</li>
            <li>and I love it ..&lt;</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>My hair loves this stuff. :)</li>
            <li>I use it in many homemade beauty products, including lotions and deoderant.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have come to love this shea butter.  </li>
            <li>This is way better than any lotions I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping &amp; great customer service.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>So I absolutely love the yellow one, so I ordered two more!!!</li>
            <li>the packaging was great and the shae butter was super fresh</li>
            <li>so I have resorted to making my own ointments since everything from the store is full of chemicals and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I love the way it has a strong smell.</li>
            <li>After the seller solicited my feedback, I explained what happened and she quickly and courteously sent a replacement in ivory without charge.  </li>
            <li>Scoop off a piece, place in a jar and mix with perhaps some jojoba oil and make your own fantastic nutrient rich moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Apply with body wet from shower or bath for best results.  </li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s not what I expected, I was impressed with the quality of butter received.  </li>
            <li>but so far I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and is already grated to a very fine powder (so you can cut that step out of whatever you&#x27;re doing).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other shea butters before and this is the best one I have come across.</li>
            <li>First time using this product and after a week all I can say is I love it!  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s butter was easy you manage.</li>
            <li>very quickly shipping....</li>
            <li>I used it in my latest lotion recipe and was delighted to find that it melts down perfectly and when cooled it stays soft and moist.  </li>
            <li>They even throw in a free E-book on how to make lotions and other uses for this wonderful stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I actually made my own lotion from it!</li>
            <li>I received a quick and very friendly reply.  </li>
            <li>All of the reviews were correct and accurate and it was from Austin, TX.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Organic Shea Butter for a few years now and I am very Happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a light, almost licorice scent.</li>
            <li>All unrefined organic shea butter has a strong smell (I found out after researching) but it is a clean earthy type smell.  </li>
            <li>It has a smooth texture.</li>
            <li>Shea Butter Lady got in touch with me and sent me her detailed microbiological lab report for this year&#x27;s batch of shea butter, showing that it meets Grade A standards.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great quality and fantastic customer service.</li>
            <li>and my skin feels silky smooth, not to mention it&#x27;s aiding in healing.  </li>
            <li>Also great for whipping in essential oils &amp; coconut oil.</li>
            <li>Well packaged, smooth going on.</li>
            <li>but i made my own shea/coconut oil/emu oil and black castor oil whip for my hair and i turned out amazing!</li>
            <li>I loved this item so much the first time, I ended up passing it out to family and friends and had to order another for myself.</li>
            <li>and I most certainly am and happy for their contact especially in dealing with a product like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No more hunting for the &#x27;perfect&#x27; shea butter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Shea Butter in the past and learned that now simplicity is best.</li>
            <li>Although I still love this product,  the only flaw is that it came in plastic, even though its also in a resealable, reusable brown paper and some kind of shiny aluminum on the side bag.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and is so nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>It melts into your skin leaving it soft and smooth with a nice sheen not a oily residue.  </li>
            <li>Out of 4 different Shea butters I&#x27;ve ordered on Amazon, this one is by far the best!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great on my gardener and winter dry hands too!  </li>
            <li>I originally ordered the Ivory Shea which was nice as well, although not as easy to work with as the yellow shea.  </li>
            <li>I was introduced to it as a young teenager by my grandparents and the results have been amazing.</li>
            <li>Better Shea Butter really made me feel that my desires, needs, and overall happiness with their product were met or exceeded.</li>
            <li>Excellent, I use this to detangle my thick, curly hair, does the trick with water.</li>
            <li>I love the recipes book so much....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a full pound of butter</li>
            <li>Butter by Better Shea is soft with a light nutty aroma.  </li>
            <li>When this shea butter first arrived, I was extremely happy with it--smooth and free of mold, melted nicely, and the smell isn&#x27;t so bad, kind of nutty and earthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very reasonable price!</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite thing.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m enjoying trying new recipes.  </li>
            <li>My skin absorbed this Shea butter quickly without the greasiness like lotions.</li>
            <li>It goes on oily but is indeed absorbed quickly.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what was posted!  </li>
            <li>Recently found that using certain essential oils:  cedar wood, vetiver, combine with the scent of the shea butter to make a wonderful smelling lotion.  </li>
            <li>The other difference I noticed is that the yellow shea butter seems to be more pliable whereas the ivory shea butter is more friable (i.e. it more easily crumbles).  </li>
            <li>I felt fresh and</li>
            <li>It is so soft and moist that I am able to cut it with a spoon.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>This is a phenomenal 100% natural medicine.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>: This recipe was based on my own personal research.</li>
            <li>also whipped melted ivory shea butter with jojoba oil + lavender essential oil to make a nice skin cream --</li>
            <li>My skin absorbs it nicely and it hasn&#x27;t left any stains or residue on my pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I went through my first order so quickly I immediately got another one</li>
            <li>I mix it with organic oils and use it on my face and hands right after shower.</li>
            <li>The key is to melt it SLOWLY over warm but not too hot water; take your time and it makes great, long-lasting moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>Since I was doing this before bed I actually used a little more to give myself a good layer so as to continue working through the night, and upon rising the next morning my skin felt amazing.</li>
            <li>Personally I&#x27;m done spending money on a standard lotion bottles full of perfume and chemicals which do nothing good for the skin</li>
            <li>Both shipped very fast</li>
            <li>Customer service is clearly a very high priority with this company!  </li>
            <li>It even arrived a day early, kudos to BSB for getting it shipped quickly!</li>
            <li>made my hair very soft and less fly aways and frizz(this is what happen for me)</li>
            <li>I realized that it is very pure (if you know what to look or watch out for) and can be used all over or to add it with other ingredients for your own makings.</li>
            <li>but this one is soft and smooth and feels like silk.</li>
            <li>It came looking exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>I suffer from severe eczema, mostly on my neck, arms, legs and private parts.</li>
            <li>(yes, even in your hair overnight for an intense moisture treatment for hair and scalp!)</li>
            <li>The scent does overwhelm the cocoa butter at first but then fades leaving the &amp;#34;white chocolate&amp;#34; smell remaining.  </li>
            <li>I have many scars and this has worked wonders in helping them to heal faster and softer than regular or medicated lotions.</li>
            <li>so I remain beatiful longer! ;)</li>
            <li>This is one of those cases where I&#x27;m convinced you really do get what you pay for!</li>
            <li>Shea Butter mentions toxin screening nowhere on their site or on these listings, so I reached out directly to the company (via www.bettersheabutter.com) to see if they could confirm their product was lead and mercury free.</li>
            <li>No matter how much I whipped could not get ride of the grainy texture!</li>
            <li>After a couple weeks of using my skin was all the same color which helped to make the kp look better.  </li>
            <li>Product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>the color is a bright yellow color, exactly how it is pictured the scent is earthy but not overwhelming, and the packaging allows me to keep it stored safely.</li>
            <li>I have pale olive skin, so the tint doesn&#x27;t affect me too much (but it doesn&#x27;t make me look like Spongebob, which is good).</li>
            <li>and pretty much disappears once it&#x27;s absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this for my hair and already i noticed a difference it makes it super soft and manageable</li>
            <li>When it arrived it was packaged nicely in a ziplock type bag, with the shea butter itself being in an air tight bag.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this a week, and have noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I like that both ivory and yellow shea butter varieties are offered by the seller -- I have tried both, and found the product descriptions to be accurate.  </li>
            <li>Work very well for me.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Product arrived fast.</li>
            <li>It really did look like I had some sort of contagious flesh-eating</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s probably because Isabella, the owner, handles all the customer service herself, so if you ever have a problem or question she responds straight away.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal yall, this works for any skin type.</li>
            <li>Very soothing and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>very smoothly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very oily</li>
            <li>Fast prime shipping.</li>
            <li>She was very helpful and responsive, but she did confirm they do not test for lead and mercury yet.</li>
            <li>Too much $ for wat</li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I appreciated the packaging as well.</li>
            <li>I used many different commercially prepared eczema lotions, but most left him with a whole body rash or didn&#x27;t improve his eczema.</li>
            <li>and wow!  The fine lines in my forehead are barely there</li>
            <li>I bought both colors from this seller, and I personally like both Shea butter, but I love the yellow one more because it moisturize my skin very well and keep all day long.</li>
            <li>I have tried purchasing from other sellers but their Shea smells more like Vaseline than Shea and leave a very oily residue on the skin.  </li>
            <li>We have been using it by itself as a body butter, melts easily and cleanly on the skin and the odor does not last long, but the benefits do.  </li>
            <li>I put a small amount in my hand and rub it around to warm it up/melt it enough to rub on smoothly.</li>
            <li>It smells so heavenly, even though i dont like chocolate, it smells similar but more nutty, which is not heavy, hardly noticeable when applied , and overall great</li>
            <li>Used this with raw cocoa butter and coconut oil to make my own body butter.</li>
            <li>It works much better than expensive department store cosmetics, and the best part is that it is natural and does not contain any chemicals that can destroy my health.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the packaging due to temperatures in my area reaching a 100 degrees daily, but the product was secured.</li>
            <li>I did not mixed it with any other oils and on the next day my skin was much firmer, moisterzed than it was before and what is even more important  - my first wrinkles became</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes exactly as pictured, a soft brick in a plastic bag within a resealable paper bag with a silver lining.</li>
            <li>I had a bit of electrolysis done and have been using it straight on my face instead of my normal moisturizer</li>
            <li>This keeps my skin moisturized for a full 24 hours and doesn&#x27;t feel gross when you sweat.  </li>
            <li>but still a much more solid product than the yellow.  </li>
            <li>Shea was solid when arrived, yet soft &amp; goes on extremely smooth.</li>
            <li>A lot of creams cause me to break out, so I&#x27;m particularly prone to it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this shea butter over any otc brand lotion.</li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>This is high quality shea butter.</li>
            <li>i will definitely buy this again when i am done with my first batch!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to because I&#x27;m new to shea butter</li>
            <li>I was so glad to find organic, raw, unrefined Shea on Amazon!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this organic, raw and unrefined shea butter.  </li>
            <li>and I love that it&#x27;s raw without any harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried many different diets/soaps/lotions with no real success.</li>
            <li>I live in Arizona where it is very hot and dry.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft and its like a dew or moist feeling to it.</li>
            <li>I like that because I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is definitely different than the little bright yellow tubs I have purchased before.</li>
            <li>I used the yellow shea butter for this, and it turned out very well -- when mixed with equal parts coconut oil and a small amount of beeswax, it has a great consistency and goes on the skin</li>
            <li>I rub it into my hands at night and in the morning they are so soft!</li>
            <li>Most stores around me sell shea butter for the same price but get half the amount of product.</li>
            <li>I used a huge mixing bowl, my hands and a little olive oil and mashed it to a paste.</li>
            <li>Most of my lotions have turned hard when cooled (I&#x27;m a beginner)</li>
            <li>My kids also had eczema and now they have clear skin with no scars.</li>
            <li>It even helped clear up my dad&#x27;s exzema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is natural and doesn&#x27;t make me headache.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, my five star rating pertains to the quality of the product, packaging, and care shown by the company regarding communication and satisfaction assessment from the customer.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>My skin is practically baby soft.</li>
            <li>I developed Psoriasis after giving birth to my daughter and it cleared it up in about 3-5 days.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the product I received.  </li>
            <li>My 86 year old Mother in law has started using in on her psoriasis and it is going away and the rest of her skin has stopped flaking.  </li>
            <li>make the skin soft and beatiful</li>
            <li>No issues so far.</li>
            <li>I use their Shea for my Natural Hair and Beauty product line and my customers can&#x27;t seem to get enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This makes it easy to just dip a small piece out of the jar and spread it on my face generously.</li>
            <li>I ordered this because it seemed like a decent price, and it probably would have been if the plastic inside wasn&#x27;t ripped open and</li>
            <li>( I may be sensitive to the root that is added to make the shea yellow though I had no negative effects on my skin.)  </li>
            <li>and I think the smell is a little bit strong for me since I&#x27;m using it as my regular moisturizer</li>
            <li>The real test will be this winter (when my skin is always dry), but so far it has worked well</li>
            <li>scooping out a rather small amount onto my finger, the texture was almost sandy, yet incredibly rich feeling.</li>
            <li>am next going to be purchasing a kitchen mixer to concoct a whipped lotion infusing some tea tree essential oil as well as a few other effective anti-inflammatory oils and ingredients, and after some continued use will update my review with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It moisturizes great, but it smells really bad.  </li>
            <li>I also use it a a general skincare cream for me and LO.</li>
            <li>I had no idea that there was natural medicines that actually work!</li>
            <li>yellow shea butter make my skin so soft ...</li>
            <li>The yellow is soft and much easier to work with which I thought would be the other way around.</li>
            <li>Lead, mercury, and other toxins can be present in the soil, and some shea butter companies either have their product certified pure by the American Shea Butter Institute or state clearly on their website and product descriptions that they have tested their products for impurities.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had initially ordered the yellow shea and had sinus irritation after applying it near my nose.</li>
            <li>I use it in it&#x27;s raw form, right out of the bag with nothing added, working it into my skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using all types of western commercialized moisturizers and other hygiene products for my entire life (I&#x27;m 26) with little to no results for my acute eczema, but no success.</li>
            <li>little bit goes a long way, so it&#x27;s well worth its price.</li>
            <li>Both my children have extra sensitive yet dry skin</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with raw shea butter.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased Shea butter in the past and this particular product far excels those others.</li>

            <li> Make our own liquid bath soap without all the chemicals or $$.</li>
            <li> I tried it out on its own by melting a bit in my hands and applying to my affected areas.</li>
            <li> I have shared it with some friends and they are really loving it too.</li>

            <li> I primarily bought this for my hair since I heard so many good things about shea butter.</li>
            <li> This shea butter has a light pleasant smell and liquifies easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very smooth and unlike Shea butter</li>
            <li> I love it, my skin loves is and my hair loves it..</li>
            <li> and I love the fact that it comes with a recipe book.</li>

            <li> , Better Shea Butter&#x27;s customer service is OUTSTANDING.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be going anywhere else for my Shea butter needs :)</li>
            <li> I could not be more satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Perfect in every way, I will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Not just ethnic skin, like my own, which is light brown.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I use it with my favorite Shea butter lotion as an additive and alone in my hair and my daughters hair as a pre-shampoo oil treatment.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  </li>
            <li> After everything was melted I stuck it in the fridge until it solidified on the top and sides.</li>
            <li> The day after, his skin already looked better.</li>
            <li> However, my intended use for the shea butter was to make own sunblock (of which a recipe is included in the free e-book).  </li>
            <li> The product came fast and in great condition.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> i will be buying more.</li>
            <li> The Shea butter was nicely and securely  packaged.</li>
            <li> Because I don&#x27;t feel safe using this product as an expectant mother, she offered to refund my order.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li> so worries that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it all in 2yrs</li>
            <li> , I spilt it up and gifted to two close friends who are also enjoying it.  </li>
            <li> The company also seems to be great to work with, they are very responsive to questions via email.</li>
            <li> and I love it ..&lt;</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> My hair loves this stuff. :)</li>
            <li> I use it in many homemade beauty products, including lotions and deoderant.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have come to love this shea butter.  </li>
            <li> This is way better than any lotions I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping &amp; great customer service.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> So I absolutely love the yellow one, so I ordered two more!!!</li>
            <li> the packaging was great and the shae butter was super fresh</li>
            <li> so I have resorted to making my own ointments since everything from the store is full of chemicals and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I love the way it has a strong smell.</li>
            <li> After the seller solicited my feedback, I explained what happened and she quickly and courteously sent a replacement in ivory without charge.  </li>
            <li> Scoop off a piece, place in a jar and mix with perhaps some jojoba oil and make your own fantastic nutrient rich moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Apply with body wet from shower or bath for best results.  </li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s not what I expected, I was impressed with the quality of butter received.  </li>
            <li> but so far I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and is already grated to a very fine powder (so you can cut that step out of whatever you&#x27;re doing).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other shea butters before and this is the best one I have come across.</li>
            <li> First time using this product and after a week all I can say is I love it!  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s butter was easy you manage.</li>
            <li> very quickly shipping....</li>
            <li> I used it in my latest lotion recipe and was delighted to find that it melts down perfectly and when cooled it stays soft and moist.  </li>
            <li> They even throw in a free E-book on how to make lotions and other uses for this wonderful stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I actually made my own lotion from it!</li>
            <li> I received a quick and very friendly reply.  </li>
            <li> All of the reviews were correct and accurate and it was from Austin, TX.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Organic Shea Butter for a few years now and I am very Happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a light, almost licorice scent.</li>
            <li> All unrefined organic shea butter has a strong smell (I found out after researching) but it is a clean earthy type smell.  </li>
            <li> It has a smooth texture.</li>
            <li> Shea Butter Lady got in touch with me and sent me her detailed microbiological lab report for this year&#x27;s batch of shea butter, showing that it meets Grade A standards.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great quality and fantastic customer service.</li>
            <li> and my skin feels silky smooth, not to mention it&#x27;s aiding in healing.  </li>
            <li> Also great for whipping in essential oils &amp; coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Well packaged, smooth going on.</li>
            <li> but i made my own shea/coconut oil/emu oil and black castor oil whip for my hair and i turned out amazing!</li>
            <li> I loved this item so much the first time, I ended up passing it out to family and friends and had to order another for myself.</li>
            <li> and I most certainly am and happy for their contact especially in dealing with a product like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more hunting for the &#x27;perfect&#x27; shea butter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Shea Butter in the past and learned that now simplicity is best.</li>
            <li> Although I still love this product,  the only flaw is that it came in plastic, even though its also in a resealable, reusable brown paper and some kind of shiny aluminum on the side bag.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and is so nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> It melts into your skin leaving it soft and smooth with a nice sheen not a oily residue.  </li>
            <li> Out of 4 different Shea butters I&#x27;ve ordered on Amazon, this one is by far the best!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great on my gardener and winter dry hands too!  </li>
            <li> I originally ordered the Ivory Shea which was nice as well, although not as easy to work with as the yellow shea.  </li>
            <li> I was introduced to it as a young teenager by my grandparents and the results have been amazing.</li>
            <li> Better Shea Butter really made me feel that my desires, needs, and overall happiness with their product were met or exceeded.</li>
            <li> Excellent, I use this to detangle my thick, curly hair, does the trick with water.</li>
            <li> I love the recipes book so much....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a full pound of butter</li>
            <li> Butter by Better Shea is soft with a light nutty aroma.  </li>
            <li> When this shea butter first arrived, I was extremely happy with it--smooth and free of mold, melted nicely, and the smell isn&#x27;t so bad, kind of nutty and earthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very reasonable price!</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite thing.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m enjoying trying new recipes.  </li>
            <li> My skin absorbed this Shea butter quickly without the greasiness like lotions.</li>
            <li> It goes on oily but is indeed absorbed quickly.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what was posted!  </li>
            <li> Recently found that using certain essential oils:  cedar wood, vetiver, combine with the scent of the shea butter to make a wonderful smelling lotion.  </li>
            <li> The other difference I noticed is that the yellow shea butter seems to be more pliable whereas the ivory shea butter is more friable (i.e. it more easily crumbles).  </li>
            <li> I felt fresh and</li>
            <li> It is so soft and moist that I am able to cut it with a spoon.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is a phenomenal 100% natural medicine.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> : This recipe was based on my own personal research.</li>
            <li> also whipped melted ivory shea butter with jojoba oil + lavender essential oil to make a nice skin cream --</li>
            <li> My skin absorbs it nicely and it hasn&#x27;t left any stains or residue on my pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I went through my first order so quickly I immediately got another one</li>
            <li> I mix it with organic oils and use it on my face and hands right after shower.</li>
            <li> The key is to melt it SLOWLY over warm but not too hot water; take your time and it makes great, long-lasting moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> Since I was doing this before bed I actually used a little more to give myself a good layer so as to continue working through the night, and upon rising the next morning my skin felt amazing.</li>
            <li> Personally I&#x27;m done spending money on a standard lotion bottles full of perfume and chemicals which do nothing good for the skin</li>
            <li> Both shipped very fast</li>
            <li> Customer service is clearly a very high priority with this company!  </li>
            <li> It even arrived a day early, kudos to BSB for getting it shipped quickly!</li>
            <li> made my hair very soft and less fly aways and frizz(this is what happen for me)</li>
            <li> I realized that it is very pure (if you know what to look or watch out for) and can be used all over or to add it with other ingredients for your own makings.</li>
            <li> but this one is soft and smooth and feels like silk.</li>
            <li> It came looking exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> I suffer from severe eczema, mostly on my neck, arms, legs and private parts.</li>
            <li> (yes, even in your hair overnight for an intense moisture treatment for hair and scalp!)</li>
            <li> The scent does overwhelm the cocoa butter at first but then fades leaving the &amp;#34;white chocolate&amp;#34; smell remaining.  </li>
            <li> I have many scars and this has worked wonders in helping them to heal faster and softer than regular or medicated lotions.</li>
            <li> so I remain beatiful longer! ;)</li>
            <li> This is one of those cases where I&#x27;m convinced you really do get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> Shea Butter mentions toxin screening nowhere on their site or on these listings, so I reached out directly to the company (via www.bettersheabutter.com) to see if they could confirm their product was lead and mercury free.</li>
            <li> No matter how much I whipped could not get ride of the grainy texture!</li>
            <li> After a couple weeks of using my skin was all the same color which helped to make the kp look better.  </li>
            <li> Product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> the color is a bright yellow color, exactly how it is pictured the scent is earthy but not overwhelming, and the packaging allows me to keep it stored safely.</li>
            <li> I have pale olive skin, so the tint doesn&#x27;t affect me too much (but it doesn&#x27;t make me look like Spongebob, which is good).</li>
            <li> and pretty much disappears once it&#x27;s absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this for my hair and already i noticed a difference it makes it super soft and manageable</li>
            <li> When it arrived it was packaged nicely in a ziplock type bag, with the shea butter itself being in an air tight bag.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this a week, and have noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I like that both ivory and yellow shea butter varieties are offered by the seller -- I have tried both, and found the product descriptions to be accurate.  </li>
            <li> Work very well for me.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Product arrived fast.</li>
            <li> It really did look like I had some sort of contagious flesh-eating</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s probably because Isabella, the owner, handles all the customer service herself, so if you ever have a problem or question she responds straight away.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal yall, this works for any skin type.</li>
            <li> Very soothing and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> very smoothly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very oily</li>
            <li> Fast prime shipping.</li>
            <li> She was very helpful and responsive, but she did confirm they do not test for lead and mercury yet.</li>
            <li> Too much $ for wat</li>
            <li> Fast service.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I appreciated the packaging as well.</li>
            <li> I used many different commercially prepared eczema lotions, but most left him with a whole body rash or didn&#x27;t improve his eczema.</li>
            <li> and wow!  The fine lines in my forehead are barely there</li>
            <li> I bought both colors from this seller, and I personally like both Shea butter, but I love the yellow one more because it moisturize my skin very well and keep all day long.</li>
            <li> I have tried purchasing from other sellers but their Shea smells more like Vaseline than Shea and leave a very oily residue on the skin.  </li>
            <li> We have been using it by itself as a body butter, melts easily and cleanly on the skin and the odor does not last long, but the benefits do.  </li>
            <li> I put a small amount in my hand and rub it around to warm it up/melt it enough to rub on smoothly.</li>
            <li> It smells so heavenly, even though i dont like chocolate, it smells similar but more nutty, which is not heavy, hardly noticeable when applied , and overall great</li>
            <li> Used this with raw cocoa butter and coconut oil to make my own body butter.</li>
            <li> It works much better than expensive department store cosmetics, and the best part is that it is natural and does not contain any chemicals that can destroy my health.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the packaging due to temperatures in my area reaching a 100 degrees daily, but the product was secured.</li>
            <li> I did not mixed it with any other oils and on the next day my skin was much firmer, moisterzed than it was before and what is even more important  - my first wrinkles became</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes exactly as pictured, a soft brick in a plastic bag within a resealable paper bag with a silver lining.</li>
            <li> I had a bit of electrolysis done and have been using it straight on my face instead of my normal moisturizer</li>
            <li> This keeps my skin moisturized for a full 24 hours and doesn&#x27;t feel gross when you sweat.  </li>
            <li> but still a much more solid product than the yellow.  </li>
            <li> Shea was solid when arrived, yet soft &amp; goes on extremely smooth.</li>
            <li> A lot of creams cause me to break out, so I&#x27;m particularly prone to it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this shea butter over any otc brand lotion.</li>
            <li> High quality.</li>
            <li> This is high quality shea butter.</li>
            <li> i will definitely buy this again when i am done with my first batch!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to because I&#x27;m new to shea butter</li>
            <li> I was so glad to find organic, raw, unrefined Shea on Amazon!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this organic, raw and unrefined shea butter.  </li>
            <li> and I love that it&#x27;s raw without any harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried many different diets/soaps/lotions with no real success.</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona where it is very hot and dry.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft and its like a dew or moist feeling to it.</li>
            <li> I like that because I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is definitely different than the little bright yellow tubs I have purchased before.</li>
            <li> I used the yellow shea butter for this, and it turned out very well -- when mixed with equal parts coconut oil and a small amount of beeswax, it has a great consistency and goes on the skin</li>
            <li> I rub it into my hands at night and in the morning they are so soft!</li>
            <li> Most stores around me sell shea butter for the same price but get half the amount of product.</li>
            <li> I used a huge mixing bowl, my hands and a little olive oil and mashed it to a paste.</li>
            <li> Most of my lotions have turned hard when cooled (I&#x27;m a beginner)</li>
            <li> My kids also had eczema and now they have clear skin with no scars.</li>
            <li> It even helped clear up my dad&#x27;s exzema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is natural and doesn&#x27;t make me headache.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So far, my five star rating pertains to the quality of the product, packaging, and care shown by the company regarding communication and satisfaction assessment from the customer.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> My skin is practically baby soft.</li>
            <li> I developed Psoriasis after giving birth to my daughter and it cleared it up in about 3-5 days.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the product I received.  </li>
            <li> My 86 year old Mother in law has started using in on her psoriasis and it is going away and the rest of her skin has stopped flaking.  </li>
            <li> make the skin soft and beatiful</li>
            <li> No issues so far.</li>
            <li> I use their Shea for my Natural Hair and Beauty product line and my customers can&#x27;t seem to get enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This makes it easy to just dip a small piece out of the jar and spread it on my face generously.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because it seemed like a decent price, and it probably would have been if the plastic inside wasn&#x27;t ripped open and</li>
            <li> ( I may be sensitive to the root that is added to make the shea yellow though I had no negative effects on my skin.)  </li>
            <li> and I think the smell is a little bit strong for me since I&#x27;m using it as my regular moisturizer</li>
            <li> The real test will be this winter (when my skin is always dry), but so far it has worked well</li>
            <li> scooping out a rather small amount onto my finger, the texture was almost sandy, yet incredibly rich feeling.</li>
            <li> am next going to be purchasing a kitchen mixer to concoct a whipped lotion infusing some tea tree essential oil as well as a few other effective anti-inflammatory oils and ingredients, and after some continued use will update my review with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It moisturizes great, but it smells really bad.  </li>
            <li> I also use it a a general skincare cream for me and LO.</li>
            <li> I had no idea that there was natural medicines that actually work!</li>
            <li> yellow shea butter make my skin so soft ...</li>
            <li> The yellow is soft and much easier to work with which I thought would be the other way around.</li>
            <li> Lead, mercury, and other toxins can be present in the soil, and some shea butter companies either have their product certified pure by the American Shea Butter Institute or state clearly on their website and product descriptions that they have tested their products for impurities.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had initially ordered the yellow shea and had sinus irritation after applying it near my nose.</li>
            <li> I use it in it&#x27;s raw form, right out of the bag with nothing added, working it into my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using all types of western commercialized moisturizers and other hygiene products for my entire life (I&#x27;m 26) with little to no results for my acute eczema, but no success.</li>
            <li> little bit goes a long way, so it&#x27;s well worth its price.</li>
            <li> Both my children have extra sensitive yet dry skin</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with raw shea butter.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased Shea butter in the past and this particular product far excels those others.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot more work than conventional lotions, but therein lies the secret: it actually works!</li>
            <li> It has a slightly nutty scent to it.it was kind of hard when it arrived, but that&#x27;s more than likely due to the cold weather here in Michigan.</li>
            <li> Also this may sound expensive at first but it lasts for so long it ends up being cheaper than buying lotion if you apply everyday like we have to in Arizona.</li>
            <li> This bar is going to last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> I battle severe dry skin every winter, especially on my thighs.</li>
            <li> I used coconut oil on his eczema, but his skin was still dry and red.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this seller if you are shopping for raw shea butter.</li>
            <li> all the shea butter was all dried out so it was pretty much a waste for me.</li>
            <li> its mixed with other stuff</li>
            <li> The redness wasn&#x27;t gone, however it diminished slightly to a pinkish color, and where I would normally wake up with a tight and dry sensation on my face,</li>
            <li> have extremely dry, itchy skin on my arms in legs that seems to worsen in winter.</li>
            <li> I remember one day in 5th grade, the skin on my hands was so dry and cracked the teacher freaked out and had me contact my parents to come pick me up.</li>
            <li> Even in this harshest of winters, i did not have any dry patches on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin, and tend to wash my hands a lot.</li>
            <li> He wears hats and they tend to cause his forehead to dry and flake....</li>
            <li> My skin is so dry in the winter</li>
            <li> In less than a day, my rough darkened skin due to eczema, started to return to its natural pigment.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, it&#x27;s very faint</li>
            <li> I had a small breakout but that&#x27;s from trying something new, plus the small breakout didn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> I usually like to mix my shea butter with various oils such as coconut and almond to soften it.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry and</li>
            <li> Due to some mailing issues i haven&#x27;t had my Shea butter for long but from the moment i opened it</li>
            <li> Takes a little work to mush it up but no big deal.</li>
            <li> not much products can help my skin.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.  </li>
            <li> As a consequence, I found the yellow shea butter easier to rub into my skin when used raw.  </li>
            <li> I always heard about Shea butter I bought at my local store but not the raw one</li>
            <li> Then I took about half the package and mixed it with a hand mixer just to get it fluffy.</li>
            <li> and a  little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe, but it&#x27;s like it forms a seal around you, locking everything in and penetrating deep.</li>
            <li> During the winter months especially, you&#x27;ll find this product lasts and maintains a solid barrier against the cold, drying air outside or in your home.  </li>
            <li> last time I wanted yellow, and received wrong..</li>
            <li> And you need so little of it compared to lotions, even if I share some with my sisters, this will last a few months, at least.</li>
            <li> not good they mixed it with some type of oil</li>
            <li> Smell not overwhelming and blended well with other ingredients.</li>
            <li> I decided I would try another round of &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; products before calling an allergist.</li>
            <li> With Nature Dead Sea Mud Dead Sea Minerals Soap, 7 Ounce Bar,&amp;#34; organic jojoba oil, evening primrose oil and sea buckthorn seed oil.</li>
            <li> After his bath with the Dead Sea soap, I used the homemade lotion.</li>
            <li> and I use it on my skin everyday, including my face and lips.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about trying this shea stuff, I always see the Jamaican guy at the flea market selling little containers of it, but never gave much thought into trying it.</li>
            <li> will defenetly continue to use the 100% Raw Unrefined Organic Shea Butter as my night cream.</li>
            <li> The smell is not &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34; because it is raw with no perfumes added.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy a raw Shea butter</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used raw shea butter before</li>
            <li> Not sure why but it does.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like heavily scented products because I get terrible migraines, but this is perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> Recommend it for anyone who suffers from extreme dry skin &amp; acne.</li>
            <li> With eczema, you get desperate enough to just about try any thing!</li>
            <li> 5 stars hands down!!!</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and have had it for a little over a decade, and needless to say</li>
            <li> I get dry patches that are itchy and then painful as my skin cracks.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t crackled or broken and the itching was albeit gone</li>
            <li> Get rid of your expensive face creams, lotions, etc.  </li>
            <li> You may not have the same results, but I wanted to share our experience with hopes it may help others with this horrible skin condition.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, I feel I must discontinue using this product until I hear confirmation that it does not contain these dangerous toxins.</li>
            <li> My husband suffers from itchy skin.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been so desperate he poured bleach on himself trying to burn out the itch.</li>
            <li> It is awful.</li>
            <li> I bought the 5lb bag and then gave some to my friend who has TERRIBLE eczema.</li>
            <li> I have horrible eczema</li>
            <li> Terrible butter times 3!</li>
            <li> No way could I use it in my hair &amp; felt awful on my skin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I got the Ivory Shea Butter and it is awesome I love it, my skin loves is and my hair loves it..and I love the fact that it comes with a recipe book.</li>
            <li> My skin absorbed this Shea butter quickly without the greasiness like lotions. I love the way it has a strong smell. It works great in my body butters.</li>
            <li> This is the best Shea butter I have purchased and used to date!</li>
            <li> I like this butter. Work very well for me.&lt;br /&gt;But last time I wanted yellow, and received wrong..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;Second time didn&#x27;t receive YELLOW butter! . .</li>
            <li> Very good product. My skin seems to like it. I immediately noticed nourished glowing skin in two days. I had a small breakout but that&#x27;s from trying something new, plus the small breakout didn&#x27;t last that long. My skin feels very soft and its like a dew or moist feeling to it.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT. BY FAR THE BEST SHEA BUTTER I&#x27;VE USED. VERY HAPPY WITH IT.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I read the description said it is preferred by people affected by eczema.  The smell is natural and doesn&#x27;t make me headache.  I just made eczema cream yesterday.  I&#x27;m still trying it.</li>
            <li> i like this product..really didnt have a smell but i made my own shea/coconut oil/emu oil and black castor oil whip for my hair and i turned out amazing! made my hair very soft and less fly aways and frizz(this is what happen for me) i will buy again</li>
            <li> I received the yellow Shea butter and immediately wanted to give it a try as a moisturizer. I have psoriasis and have had it for a little over a decade, and needless to say have tried just about everything one could attempt to relieve the symptoms, short of the medical solutions which are used to lower the immune systems response; that options scared the hell out of me as it opens the door for contracting potential diseases. No thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon scooping out a rather small amount onto my finger, the texture was almost sandy, yet incredibly rich feeling. I applied it to my face, scalp (the sides of my head are shaved as is the back) and the spots on my arms and legs where I have psoriasis. It took a minute or two of massaging to relieve the oily layer and appearance, however as Shea users know it soaked into my skin like it was part of our biology. Since I was doing this before bed I actually used a little more to give myself a good layer so as to continue working through the night, and upon rising the next morning my skin felt amazing. The redness wasn&#x27;t gone, however it diminished slightly to a pinkish color, and where I would normally wake up with a tight and dry sensation on my face, I felt fresh and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am next going to be purchasing a kitchen mixer to concoct a whipped lotion infusing some tea tree essential oil as well as a few other effective anti-inflammatory oils and ingredients, and after some continued use will update my review with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, my five star rating pertains to the quality of the product, packaging, and care shown by the company regarding communication and satisfaction assessment from the customer. Better Shea Butter really made me feel that my desires, needs, and overall happiness with their product were met or exceeded. That&#x27;s how client relations should be, and I appreciate their dedication!</li>
            <li> Due to some mailing issues i haven&#x27;t had my Shea butter for long but from the moment i opened it i knew i was going to love it! the color is a bright yellow color, exactly how it is pictured the scent is earthy but not overwhelming, and the packaging allows me to keep it stored safely. I bought this for my hair and already i noticed a difference it makes it super soft and manageable and i love it! and a  little goes a long way! i will definitely buy this again when i am done with my first batch!</li>
            <li> Product is awesome. Purchased to make body cream for me and daughter. Creme turn out great. She&#x27;s butter was easy you manage. Smell not overwhelming and blended well with other ingredients. Definitely will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Product arrived fast. I ordered the yellow one and I think the smell is a little bit strong for me since I&#x27;m using it as my regular moisturizer I will get the ivory next time the smell is milder. But this product is a good quality shea butter than the one I&#x27;m getting at the store.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shea butter I have ever experienced. It is so soft and moist that I am able to cut it with a spoon. I used it in my latest lotion recipe and was delighted to find that it melts down perfectly and when cooled it stays soft and moist.  Most of my lotions have turned hard when cooled (I&#x27;m a beginner) but this one is soft and smooth and feels like silk. Thank you for making such a delightful product!</li>
            <li> OMG! Holy Shea, this is good stuff! Make lip balm, shaving cream, put it on your skin, heck put on your potato! This stuff is where it&#x27;s at!</li>
            <li> This shea butter was awesome!  All of the reviews were correct and accurate and it was from Austin, TX.  Even better!</li>
            <li> love it  looking forward using it in soaps etc. also</li>
            <li> Great price and quality. The company will even give you recipes. I made a diaper cream with this Shea Butter mixed with coconut oil, olive oil, GSE, Calendula Extract, and Lavender Extract. It works great at reducing redness, and healing the skin from rashes. I also use it a a general skincare cream for me and LO.</li>
            <li> Keeps the skin moist but not oily , perfect esp in winter!</li>
            <li> I must say, I absolutely LOVE this Shea Butter. I was so glad to find organic, raw, unrefined Shea on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely dry, itchy skin on my arms in legs that seems to worsen in winter. As a child, our family doctor prescribed all sorts of topical steroid creams, lotions and even pills to help with the itching and flaking. They would work for a short while, but would always come back with a vengeance as soon as I stopped using the prescriptions. I remember one day in 5th grade, the skin on my hands was so dry and cracked the teacher freaked out and had me contact my parents to come pick me up. It really did look like I had some sort of contagious flesh-eating disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for all this detail is because after trying a lot of different things, this Shea butter is the only thing that actually heals my skin. I literally coated my legs (and the rest of my body) with it before bed and when I woke up the next morning, my skin looked way different. It wasn&#x27;t crackled or broken and the itching was albeit gone and this was after only one night of using it! It&#x27;s hard to describe, but it&#x27;s like it forms a seal around you, locking everything in and penetrating deep. I love the smell, it&#x27;s very faint and pretty much disappears once it&#x27;s absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes exactly as pictured, a soft brick in a plastic bag within a resealable paper bag with a silver lining. It even arrived a day early, kudos to BSB for getting it shipped quickly! I use it in it&#x27;s raw form, right out of the bag with nothing added, working it into my skin. It&#x27;s a lot more work than conventional lotions, but therein lies the secret: it actually works! No added chemicals, fillers, or junk that your skin doesn&#x27;t want or need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Better Shea Butter&#x27;s customer service is OUTSTANDING. That&#x27;s probably because Isabella, the owner, handles all the customer service herself, so if you ever have a problem or question she responds straight away. I won&#x27;t be going anywhere else for my Shea butter needs :) I love BSB!ere else for my Shea butter needs :) I love BSB!</li>
            <li> I have been using Organic Shea Butter for a few years now and I am very Happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;N.K.A.</li>
            <li> I battle severe dry skin every winter, especially on my thighs. I get dry patches that are itchy and then painful as my skin cracks. It is awful. Not this year! I made a point of putting this shea butter on my legs after every shower. Even in this harshest of winters, i did not have any dry patches on my skin. It was such a relief- what a miracle! I especially love that this product is organic. It is definitely different than the little bright yellow tubs I have purchased before.</li>
            <li> The quality of this shea butter is absolutely amazing. I usually like to mix my shea butter with various oils such as coconut and almond to soften it. But, with this butter there was no mixing involved. It was very smooth, creamy, and provided great moisturization. I would highly recommend this shea butter over any otc brand lotion.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes great, but it smells really bad.  Some people aren&#x27;t bothered by the smell, but I am.  To each his (or her) own.</li>
            <li> I ordered the &amp;#34;Yellow&amp;#34; &amp; got the &amp;#34;Ivory&amp;#34;...then when I took it out of the packaging to inspect it, the bottom had 4 nice sized spots of mold on it..so beware before you buy this product..</li>
            <li> This is the best quality Shea Butter I have used so far.  I mix it with organic oils and use it on my face and hands right after shower. It keeps my skin soft and moisturized. It works much better than expensive department store cosmetics, and the best part is that it is natural and does not contain any chemicals that can destroy my health.</li>
            <li> High quality. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This stuff&#x27;s great. Worth the money. I bought the 5lb bag and then gave some to my friend who has TERRIBLE eczema. She loves it too</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin, and tend to wash my hands a lot. I&#x27;ve only been using this a week, and have noticed a huge difference. My skin is practically baby soft. And you need so little of it compared to lotions, even if I share some with my sisters, this will last a few months, at least. This is a great value. It has a light, almost licorice scent. I don&#x27;t like heavily scented products because I get terrible migraines, but this is perfectly fine. I have pale olive skin, so the tint doesn&#x27;t affect me too much (but it doesn&#x27;t make me look like Spongebob, which is good). It came looking exactly like the picture. I could not be more satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because it seemed like a decent price, and it probably would have been if the plastic inside wasn&#x27;t ripped open and all the shea butter was all dried out so it was pretty much a waste for me.</li>
            <li> Excellent, I use this to detangle my thick, curly hair, does the trick with water. Also I use on my mothers head on part after she had brain surgery, and she says it soothes and helps to alleviate pain and irritation and also helps to assist and amazingly moisturize so that it wont hurt when if it stretches. It smells so heavenly, even though i dont like chocolate, it smells similar but more nutty, which is not heavy, hardly noticeable when applied , and overall great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: ive just remembered the con of this product. Although I still love this product,  the only flaw is that it came in plastic, even though its also in a resealable, reusable brown paper and some kind of shiny aluminum on the side bag. But still a great product.</li>
            <li> The Shea Butter exceeded my expectations. Perfect in every way, I will definitely be purchasing again. Thank you for the superb quality.</li>
            <li> I suffer from severe eczema, mostly on my neck, arms, legs and private parts. This is a phenomenal 100% natural medicine.&lt;br /&gt;You feel moisturized the minute you rub it into your skin. In less than a day, my rough darkened skin due to eczema, started to return to its natural pigment. This is the real deal yall, this works for any skin type. Not just ethnic skin, like my own, which is light brown.&lt;br /&gt;  I have been using all types of western commercialized moisturizers and other hygiene products for my entire life (I&#x27;m 26) with little to no results for my acute eczema, but no success. Please, if you have any doubts about trying this product please, just try it. I had no idea that there was natural medicines that actually work! I was very skeptical about trying this shea stuff, I always see the Jamaican guy at the flea market selling little containers of it, but never gave much thought into trying it. With eczema, you get desperate enough to just about try any thing! To my surprise, I ended up throwing away all of the &amp;#34;big commercial&amp;#34; moisturizes I had been using, and only use shea butter now. They even throw in a free E-book on how to make lotions and other uses for this wonderful stuff. 5 stars hands down!!!</li>
            <li> I love this organic, raw and unrefined shea butter.  Get rid of your expensive face creams, lotions, etc.  Scoop off a piece, place in a jar and mix with perhaps some jojoba oil and make your own fantastic nutrient rich moisturizer.  During the winter months especially, you&#x27;ll find this product lasts and maintains a solid barrier against the cold, drying air outside or in your home.  Apply with body wet from shower or bath for best results.  (yes, even in your hair overnight for an intense moisture treatment for hair and scalp!)</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite thing.  I use it for everything now.  On my face, on the kids faces.  Make our own liquid bath soap without all the chemicals or $$.</li>
            <li> This is the best quality I&#x27;ve found yet! No more hunting for the &#x27;perfect&#x27; shea butter.</li>
            <li> I bought both colors from this seller, and I personally like both Shea butter, but I love the yellow one more because it moisturize my skin very well and keep all day long. My skin is very dry and not much products can help my skin. So I absolutely love the yellow one, so I ordered two more!!!</li>
            <li> I love it. I was introduced to it as a young teenager by my grandparents and the results have been amazing. I developed Psoriasis after giving birth to my daughter and it cleared it up in about 3-5 days. My kids also had eczema and now they have clear skin with no scars. I use it with my favorite Shea butter lotion as an additive and alone in my hair and my daughters hair as a pre-shampoo oil treatment. I takes getting used if you don&#x27;t like grease but the results are amazing. I was very pleased with the packaging due to temperatures in my area reaching a 100 degrees daily, but the product was secured. I have always recommended Shea butter to family and friends for any skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;I had to find another company for the product and the company recommended on Amazon delivered great product.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bought shea butter before so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  All unrefined organic shea butter has a strong smell (I found out after researching) but it is a clean earthy type smell.  We have been using it by itself as a body butter, melts easily and cleanly on the skin and the odor does not last long, but the benefits do.  I have mixed it with cocoa butter and beeswax to make lotion bars.  The scent does overwhelm the cocoa butter at first but then fades leaving the &amp;#34;white chocolate&amp;#34; smell remaining.  Recently found that using certain essential oils:  cedar wood, vetiver, combine with the scent of the shea butter to make a wonderful smelling lotion.  I am impressed with this and will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I loved this item so much the first time, I ended up passing it out to family and friends and had to order another for myself. I have many scars and this has worked wonders in helping them to heal faster and softer than regular or medicated lotions. It even helped clear up my dad&#x27;s exzema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both times the seller contacted me to make sure I was happy with the product and I most certainly am and happy for their contact especially in dealing with a product like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was wrapped well and no melting etc. I will buy again as needed.</li>
            <li> I started using this on my son that has eczema. We&#x27;ve tried many different diets/soaps/lotions with no real success. I used coconut oil on his eczema, but his skin was still dry and red. I used many different commercially prepared eczema lotions, but most left him with a whole body rash or didn&#x27;t improve his eczema. I decided I would try another round of &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; products before calling an allergist. I bought &amp;#34;One With Nature Dead Sea Mud Dead Sea Minerals Soap, 7 Ounce Bar,&amp;#34; organic jojoba oil, evening primrose oil and sea buckthorn seed oil. (Note: I had already hempseed oil, coconut oil, vitamin E oil, lavender essential oil and German chamomile essential oil.) All these products have different benefits to eczema. I got everything I could organic. I melted 1/4 cup shea butter in a double boiler and added 1/2 Tblsp coconut oil, jojoba oil, hempseed oil and evening primrose oil. After everything was melted I stuck it in the fridge until it solidified on the top and sides. I then added 1/2 tsp vitamin E oil, 5 drops lavender essential oil, 5 drops German chamomile and 20 drops sea buckthorn seed oil. I whipped it up to frosting consistency. After his bath with the Dead Sea soap, I used the homemade lotion. You don&#x27;t need a lot! The day after, his skin already looked better. 3 days later, you wouldn&#x27;t know this kid ever had eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: This recipe was based on my own personal research. You may not have the same results, but I wanted to share our experience with hopes it may help others with this horrible skin condition.</li>
            <li> I have horrible eczema so I have resorted to making my own ointments since everything from the store is full of chemicals and doesn&#x27;t work. I got this shea butter and made a balm with it using beeswax, coconut oil and calendula. I love this Shea butter! I tried it out on its own by melting a bit in my hands and applying to my affected areas. Very soothing and moisturizing. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and is so nice and smooth. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Shea butter is a staple product for the maintenance of my skin. I have ordered this package 2 times already and I will continue to order it until I can&#x27;t order anymore! I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with raw shea butter.  I was pleasantly surprised by the product I received.  The unadorned packaging is charming.  The re-sealable bag holds the shea butter, which is wrapped in plastic.  I like that both ivory and yellow shea butter varieties are offered by the seller -- I have tried both, and found the product descriptions to be accurate.  The yellow shea butter definitely has a stronger, &amp;#34;nuttier&amp;#34; aroma, which may or may not be preferred (I happen to prefer it).  The other difference I noticed is that the yellow shea butter seems to be more pliable whereas the ivory shea butter is more friable (i.e. it more easily crumbles).  As a consequence, I found the yellow shea butter easier to rub into my skin when used raw.  However, my intended use for the shea butter was to make own sunblock (of which a recipe is included in the free e-book).  I used the yellow shea butter for this, and it turned out very well -- when mixed with equal parts coconut oil and a small amount of beeswax, it has a great consistency and goes on the skin very smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also whipped melted ivory shea butter with jojoba oil + lavender essential oil to make a nice skin cream -- this resulted in a great all-over moisturizer which I have been using for a week now.  It goes on oily but is indeed absorbed quickly.  The real test will be this winter (when my skin is always dry), but so far it has worked well -- it has been excellent for soothing my razor burn post-shave.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price! This is high quality shea butter. Most stores around me sell shea butter for the same price but get half the amount of product. This is an awesome deal!</li>
            <li> Great texture and easy to blend into homemade body butter recipes, leaves my skin incredibly smooth and glowy!  I will definitely buy again when I run out!</li>
            <li> The product came fast and in great condition. The Shea Butter feels wonderful and smells good too!</li>
            <li> Used to make my own lotion...works great and there&#x27;s a lot of it</li>
            <li> Smells SOOO good! Used this with raw cocoa butter and coconut oil to make my own body butter. Mixed together on stove so it all blended as an oil and stored in mason jar!</li>
            <li> My husband has bought the Yellow Organic Shea Butter for me as a part of Weeman&#x27;s Day gift so I remain beatiful longer! ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just tried it once and the results are visible on the very next morning! I put a small amount in my hand and rub it around to warm it up/melt it enough to rub on smoothly. I did not mixed it with any other oils and on the next day my skin was much firmer, moisterzed than it was before and what is even more important  - my first wrinkles became almost invisble!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will defenetly continue to use the 100% Raw Unrefined Organic Shea Butter as my night cream.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and is already grated to a very fine powder (so you can cut that step out of whatever you&#x27;re doing). Will update once i make my lotion with further review!</li>
            <li> not good they mixed it with some type of oil</li>
            <li> I have purchased Shea butter in the past and this particular product far excels those others. This one applies easier than the others I have purchased, feels wonderful, not grainy at all !!  Before the product even arrived I had an email from the seller thanking me for my purchase and if there were any questions to contact her.  When it arrived I did email to let her know it had arrived and to get the recipe manual.  I received a quick and very friendly reply.  The recipes in the manual are wonderful and I am looking forward to making them.  My 86 year old Mother in law has started using in on her psoriasis and it is going away and the rest of her skin has stopped flaking.  My husband loves it too!  He wears hats and they tend to cause his forehead to dry and flake....not anymore and he has tried everything, this is the only thing that has stopped it.  The price is great also!!!  I have found my forever Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other shea butters before and this is the best one I have come across. Both my children have extra sensitive yet dry skin and this has worked wonders. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Sooooo moisturizing! I love this shea butter! A little goes a very long way. I have shared it with some friends and they are really loving it too. The smell is not &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34; because it is raw with no perfumes added. I like that because I have very sensitive skin. I rub it into my hands at night and in the morning they are so soft!</li>
            <li> i made whipped shae butter cream and it works so good!! I also made lip balm. love it. the packaging was great and the shae butter was super fresh i will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Loved the feel of this product. It melts easily in your hands and is very good quality compared to some out her products I have used. I had to give it 4 stars instead of 5 stars because it smells like smoke. Not sure why but it does.</li>
            <li> very quickly shipping....I love the recipes book so much....yellow shea butter make my skin so soft ...but I don&#x27;t like the smell...but it&#x27;s very oily make the skin soft and beatiful</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast prime shipping. No issues so far. I can see that I will purchase this again when I&#x27;m close to running out.</li>
            <li> The Shea butter was nicely and securely  packaged. It has a smooth texture. This is the best Shea butter that I&#x27;ve had and I have been using Shea butter for 4 years. I will definitely reorder from this company again!</li>
            <li> Ordered the Yellow, but received Ivory.  While it&#x27;s not what I expected, I was impressed with the quality of butter received.  It&#x27;s very smooth and unlike Shea butter I&#x27;ve used anywhere else.  This is one of those cases where I&#x27;m convinced you really do get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> Love this butter! Will definitely buy from this seller again. Butter is nicely packaged and smells great.</li>
            <li> When this shea butter first arrived, I was extremely happy with it--smooth and free of mold, melted nicely, and the smell isn&#x27;t so bad, kind of nutty and earthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to use as a belly butter during pregnancy, and was using it for a while, until I came across some information online about impurities in shea butter from Ghana. Lead, mercury, and other toxins can be present in the soil, and some shea butter companies either have their product certified pure by the American Shea Butter Institute or state clearly on their website and product descriptions that they have tested their products for impurities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better Shea Butter mentions toxin screening nowhere on their site or on these listings, so I reached out directly to the company (via www.bettersheabutter.com) to see if they could confirm their product was lead and mercury free. No response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I feel I must discontinue using this product until I hear confirmation that it does not contain these dangerous toxins. Hence the one star rating, despite my initial satisfaction with the product. If the company will respond to my question in a satisfactory way, I will consider revising my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 12/16:&lt;br /&gt;The Shea Butter Lady got in touch with me and sent me her detailed microbiological lab report for this year&#x27;s batch of shea butter, showing that it meets Grade A standards. She was very helpful and responsive, but she did confirm they do not test for lead and mercury yet. Because I don&#x27;t feel safe using this product as an expectant mother, she offered to refund my order. Wonderful customer service.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this Shea Butter.  It&#x27;s the good stuff.  I have tried purchasing from other sellers but their Shea smells more like Vaseline than Shea and leave a very oily residue on the skin.  Others were grainy and no matter how I mixed and whipped the grains never fully came out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shea Butter by Better Shea is soft with a light nutty aroma.  It melts into your skin leaving it soft and smooth with a nice sheen not a oily residue.  This will be my go to seller for Shea Butter from now on.  I use their Shea for my Natural Hair and Beauty product line and my customers can&#x27;t seem to get enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great quality and fantastic customer service.</li>
            <li> First time using this product and after a week all I can say is I love it!  I had a bit of electrolysis done and have been using it straight on my face instead of my normal moisturizer and wow!  The fine lines in my forehead are barely there and my skin feels silky smooth, not to mention it&#x27;s aiding in healing.  It&#x27;s great on my gardener and winter dry hands too!  Can wait to whip up some recipes from the great booklet.  It&#x27;s a full pound of butter so worries that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it all in 2yrs, I spilt it up and gifted to two close friends who are also enjoying it.  Great purchase!</li>
            <li> This shea butter has a light pleasant smell and liquifies easily. Perfect as an all natural moisturizer. Arrived as specified.</li>
            <li> Great natural shea butter, I use their recipes (and my own variations) to make great skin products that I use and give as gifts everyone seems to love.  The key is to melt it SLOWLY over warm but not too hot water; take your time and it makes great, long-lasting moisturizers.  The company also seems to be great to work with, they are very responsive to questions via email.</li>
            <li> The product is excellent and the order shipped out very fast.  I originally ordered the Ivory Shea which was nice as well, although not as easy to work with as the yellow shea.  The Ivory was great once you got it melted a bit in your hand but still a much more solid product than the yellow.  The yellow is soft and much easier to work with which I thought would be the other way around. Both shipped very fast and I&#x27;m happy with both products.</li>
            <li> Too much $ for wat I ended up with! Terrible butter times 3! No matter how much I whipped could not get ride of the grainy texture! I felt like sand! No way could I use it in my hair &amp; felt awful on my skin. Felt duped and will never purchase again</li>
            <li> I always heard about Shea butter I bought at my local store but not the raw one ..&lt;br /&gt;than I decided to buy a raw Shea butter and I am very happy about my decision&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used in my skin and hair and I love it ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended ^_^&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;updated..&lt;br /&gt;this is my third purchase for my friend and family.. keep use it and you will feel the difference in your face and body</li>
            <li> I primarily bought this for my hair since I heard so many good things about shea butter. When it arrived it was packaged nicely in a ziplock type bag, with the shea butter itself being in an air tight bag. I&#x27;ve never used raw shea butter before so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. It has a slightly nutty scent to it.it was kind of hard when it arrived, but that&#x27;s more than likely due to the cold weather here in Michigan. I let it sit out for about an hour to help soften it. Then I took about half the package and mixed it with a hand mixer just to get it fluffy. The smell kind of reminds me of cocoa butter. My hair loves this stuff. :)</li>
            <li> Good quality shea butter.  I use it in many homemade beauty products, including lotions and deoderant.  I absolutely love this stuff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Shea Butter in the past and learned that now simplicity is best. I realized that it is very pure (if you know what to look or watch out for) and can be used all over or to add it with other ingredients for your own makings.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It smells so good and is easy to work with. I went with the yellow butter. Wonderful. My husband suffers from itchy skin. He&#x27;s been so desperate he poured bleach on himself trying to burn out the itch. I mixed this with peppermint oil, coconut oil and hemp oil and keep it in the fridge. It&#x27;s cooling soothing and healing. I went through my first order so quickly I immediately got another one so I&#x27;m not without.</li>
            <li> I have come to love this shea butter.  I bought the yellow and mixed it 50/50 with coconut oil and I use it on my skin everyday, including my face and lips.  I live in Arizona where it is very hot and dry.  This keeps my skin moisturized for a full 24 hours and doesn&#x27;t feel gross when you sweat.  I also have keratosis pilaris and while it didn&#x27;t take away the bumps it did even out my skin tone so I don&#x27;t have a bunch of red areas and splotchy areas.  After a couple weeks of using my skin was all the same color which helped to make the kp look better.  Also this may sound expensive at first but it lasts for so long it ends up being cheaper than buying lotion if you apply everyday like we have to in Arizona.</li>
            <li> This product is as advertised:  truly unrefined shea butter!  The yellow has a softer consistency than the ivory.  Customer service is clearly a very high priority with this company!  I had initially ordered the yellow shea and had sinus irritation after applying it near my nose.( I may be sensitive to the root that is added to make the shea yellow though I had no negative effects on my skin.)  After the seller solicited my feedback, I explained what happened and she quickly and courteously sent a replacement in ivory without charge.  I highly recommend this seller if you are shopping for raw shea butter.</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast service.</li>
            <li> This is way better than any lotions I&#x27;ve ever used. Takes a little work to mush it up but no big deal. I used a huge mixing bowl, my hands and a little olive oil and mashed it to a paste. Personally I&#x27;m done spending money on a standard lotion bottles full of perfume and chemicals which do nothing good for the skin and I&#x27;m sticking with this from now on. Doesn&#x27;t clog pores ether.</li>
            <li> Very reasonable price! Fast shipping &amp; great customer service. Product was exactly as described. Shea was solid when arrived, yet soft &amp; goes on extremely smooth. Out of 4 different Shea butters I&#x27;ve ordered on Amazon, this one is by far the best! Recommend it for anyone who suffers from extreme dry skin &amp; acne. The only thing that relieves my skin inflammation &amp; dryness. Also great for whipping in essential oils &amp; coconut oil. Try it, you&#x27;ll love it! :)</li>
            <li> I love this product. Excellent quality. I use the Shea butter for skin lotion, deodorant, and facial moisturizer. Great with cocoa butter too.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is amazing! It&#x27;s very moisturizing and I love that it&#x27;s raw without any harmful chemicals. I primarily use it on my face at night and my skin looks and feels great in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little bit goes a long way, so it&#x27;s well worth its price. This bar is going to last me a very long time. I usually break off a chunk and store it separately in a jar (I re-used a glass jar from store bought eye cream, which I thoroughly rinsed out first. It&#x27;s a perfect way to recycle). This makes it easy to just dip a small piece out of the jar and spread it on my face generously. My skin absorbs it nicely and it hasn&#x27;t left any stains or residue on my pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Since it&#x27;s a butter, it may make your skin look shiny. But don&#x27;t worry; it won&#x27;t clog your pores or make you break out. A lot of creams cause me to break out, so I&#x27;m particularly prone to it. But shea butter should not cause any reactions. It&#x27;s very gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really is the best shea butter on the market and the owner, Isabella, is a very sweet woman. She answered all of my questions and even proactively followed up with me for feedback on how she was doing with her customer service. I was impressed with her professionalism! 5 stars all the way.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.  The only problem is that I never seem to order enough.</li>
            <li> This is great quality shea butter.</li>
            <li> The best shea butter I have purchased. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was posted!  Great product. Very easy to work with. This was my first experience making lotion &amp; it easy &amp; turned out great!</li>
            <li> This Shea butter was perfect my needs. I used it in a recipe for homemade diaper rash cream and also for body butter. I appreciated the packaging as well.</li>
            <li> its not 100 percent.. its mixed with other stuff</li>
            <li> Nice product.  I&#x27;m just beginning to make my own skin care items.  My skin is so dry in the winter so I&#x27;m enjoying trying new recipes.  I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to because I&#x27;m new to shea butter but so far I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Well packaged, smooth going on.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I actually made my own lotion from it! I&#x27;m so happy I bought it!</li>
