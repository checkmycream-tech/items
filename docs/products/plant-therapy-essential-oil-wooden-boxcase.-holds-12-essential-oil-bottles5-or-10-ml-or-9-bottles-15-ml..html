            <li>Very useful and good price</li>
            <li>Love them❤</li>
            <li>I have 9 15 ml bottles and room for one or two more.</li>
            <li>Satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>This storage box is okay -</li>
            <li>She loves the box and said that as she gets more oils she would like more boxes just like this.</li>
            <li>and I can still fit a couple more.</li>
            <li>They work great for 5 ml essential oil bottles - they just don&#x27;t hold as many as I would like.</li>
            <li>I liked the first one</li>
            <li>The box was light weight.  </li>
            <li>They did fit without the dividers but then, what&#x27;s the necessity of the box?</li>
            <li>There is no way that anyone can fit 9 of the 15ml bottles inside this box.</li>
            <li>Great little box to hold your oils.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s just right for an economical way to organize my oils.</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t receive it the first time I ordered</li>
            <li>I love their essential oils!</li>
            <li>The only thing is that roller balls don&#x27;t fit in</li>
            <li>Like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li>but I have a taller one from whole foods that fits too.</li>
            <li>Small and tidy.  </li>
            <li>I used a dremel to grind down grooves on the insides of the box to allow more room, but it still tears off the labels when the bottles are replaced.</li>
            <li>so much I quickly bought a second.  </li>
            <li>but Amazon quickly refunded me the total</li>
            <li>I use mainly doterra 15ml bottles</li>
            <li>These boxes are really nice, but are just a little smaller than I was thinking they would be.</li>
            <li>Felt like it&#x27;s made of balsa wood which is also pretty fragile.  </li>
            <li>- it is a little flimsy, though, so it&#x27;s not something you&#x27;d want to be more careful with.</li>
            <li>The clasp is firm but not difficult to open and close.</li>

            <li> Pieces would not fit together.</li>
            <li> Only 4 stars as it is made of balsa wood which is thin and somewhat&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not fit all bottles of oils.  </li>
            <li> I discovered through this phone call that this is a company that cares deeply about what they sell and stand behind everything 100%.  </li>

            <li> Awful.  Pieces would not fit together.</li>
            <li> Small and tidy.  That&#x27;s just right for an economical way to organize my oils. I liked the first one so much I quickly bought a second.  Had to put the inside together but that was simple!  Love them❤</li>
            <li> Perfect for my use. Fits both my 5 ml and 15 ml bottles standing upright of doterra essential oils.  Only 4 stars as it is made of balsa wood which is thin and somewhat&lt;br /&gt;Flimsy but the locking hardware is sturdy</li>
            <li> very happy with the product</li>
            <li> I love this box!  It helped me organize the oils I keep by my bedside.  The only thing is that roller balls don&#x27;t fit in it closed.  So I got out my trusty screwdriver and took off the cover!</li>
            <li> I would buy this box, it looks just like what I want. But no where in the description does it give the dimensions. How big is it? 4 inches tall? 6 inches? How long?  It matters. You tell us the freaking weight is 6.4 oz, but don&#x27;t tell the size? Who does that? Very frustrating for your potential customers.</li>
            <li> Very useful and good price even if you don&#x27;t use this brand of oils.  Like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;Hope it comes in other sizes.</li>
            <li> I needed this so I could transport my oils to Raindrop therapy sessions. It is nothing fancy but works. I also didn&#x27;t receive it the first time I ordered but Amazon quickly refunded me the total and I reordered it. It arrives with no problems the second time.</li>
            <li> Great little box to hold your oils. I use mainly doterra 15ml bottles but I have a taller one from whole foods that fits too. It&#x27;s not huge, but I wanted something small. I have 9 15 ml bottles and room for one or two more.</li>
            <li> The box was light weight.  Felt like it&#x27;s made of balsa wood which is also pretty fragile.  Only time will tell how well it hold&#x27;s up.  It does not fit all bottles of oils.  I couldn&#x27;t use the dividers because my bottles were wider than the space.  They did fit without the dividers but then, what&#x27;s the necessity of the box?</li>
            <li> Fits our needs perfectly. Good inside dividers, but for our purpose we removed these dividers and it fit  what we had nicely. Essential oil bottles we have are not all round. All in all we have 12 essential oil bottles in different shapes but short and I can still fit a couple more. I&#x27;m happy with the box. The clasp is firm but not difficult to open and close. Satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> This storage box is okay - it does it&#x27;s purpose - it is a little flimsy, though, so it&#x27;s not something you&#x27;d want to be more careful with.</li>
            <li> The box is built decently, but with the insert, it makes the bottles impossible to remove if each spot is occupied. I used a dremel to grind down grooves on the insides of the box to allow more room, but it still tears off the labels when the bottles are replaced.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would hold the roll on oils, but it is too short..... Is there a case that will hold the roll ons?</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter who is just beginning with essential oils.  She loves the box and said that as she gets more oils she would like more boxes just like this.</li>
            <li> These boxes are really nice, but are just a little smaller than I was thinking they would be. They work great for 5 ml essential oil bottles - they just don&#x27;t hold as many as I would like.</li>
            <li> The dividers lake to be used only the box was useable</li>
            <li> This product is incorrectly advertised. There is no way that anyone can fit 9 of the 15ml bottles inside this box. The slots are too small.  I am disappointed with my order and would return it if I could, but I missed the window.</li>
            <li> The box was a good buy for the price.</li>
            <li> I was very unhappy with this product as I did not feel this was the quality item I have come to expect from the Plant Therapy Company.  I initially wrote a scathing review to which I received an unexpected reply via phone the next morning!  Shocked...to say the least!  I discovered through this phone call that this is a company that cares deeply about what they sell and stand behind everything 100%.  So, no I did not like the box, it was not up to my expected standards but I was promptly compensated and I want to thank Plant Therapy for their excellent customer service and their high integrity!  I will purchase again from them as I have several times in the past...I love their essential oils! So, the reason for one star is for the actual product (as it says; How do you rate THIS ITEM), but the company deserves 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this box!</li>
