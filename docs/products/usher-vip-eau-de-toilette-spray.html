            <li>Price was pretty good!~</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a clean smelling so the spice smell in this cologne is amazing!</li>

            <li>Love the scent.</li>
            <li>Nice smooth smell.</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought it - and will do so again after this one finishes.</li>
            <li>All they do is take your money &amp; rip u off by deceiving customers telling them their stuff is authentic when it&#x27;s all fakes &amp; knock offs.</li>
            <li>I love this smell so does my wife.</li>
            <li>but I love this cologne on my man.</li>
            <li>If this is how Usher smells I would fore sure be fan</li>
            <li>Love Usher fragrance, for the price you can&#x27;t believe.  </li>
            <li>Regret on not purchasing more than one.</li>
            <li>More like a businessman with style.</li>
            <li>I love the way this smells and</li>
            <li>and I am glad I found it on here.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I got this for my husband once before &amp; much more for it, love the bottle size &amp; price,</li>
            <li>an so did the ladys.im going to get some more asap.try</li>
            <li>women love the smell .</li>
            <li>Great for work and a night out, not very casual.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not 100 percent sure what can be said about this the first 2 are really good</li>
            <li>And at such a good price too !</li>
            <li>The product came in super quick after 3 days and then the items I got was just amazing, I was expecting just the spray and got body wash and cream.</li>
            <li>Usher VIP is a unique clean fragrance!</li>
            <li>Has a strong, cheap smell that you would get out of any $5 bottle for kids.</li>
            <li>Great arrived on time exactly what I ordered and smells great, wear it everyday</li>
            <li>It is smooth and enticing without being over powering.  </li>
            <li>The cologne you wear to smell dignified and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Great scent different from others I have .good compliments from others.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s that unique.  </li>
            <li>He was a little reluctant to try it at first, but now he loves it, and the price I paid was great!</li>
            <li>ITS COOL TOO.</li>
            <li>When my husband sprayed some on and open the product he smelt so good</li>
            <li>Good stuff, but does not last all day</li>
            <li>However, the bottle that I received does not seem to be of full strength.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS MY NEW FAVORITE  </li>
            <li>Smells great, and it last all day long in the body and a lot of more time in clothes</li>
            <li>Love it, didn&#x27;t expect it to be the huge bottle for such as mall price</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price because we paid a lot&lt;br /&gt;more</li>
            <li>this 1 fell off some where but to me its worth about 15 bucks</li>
            <li>Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations.</li>
            <li>this has been one of my husband&#x27;s rare likes.</li>
            <li>but overall it was still pretty good reasonable price</li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>:) I&#x27;ll definitely be getting him another when this bottle is finished.</li>
            <li>, I would never have ordered it in the first place.</li>
            <li>Would very much so highly reccomend this product to a friend no doubt!!</li>
            <li>When I first met my fianc&amp;eacute; he wore this.</li>
            <li>prices and quanity are the best can never go wrong.</li>
            <li>I MUST  SAY, ITS OFF THE CHARTS!THE SMELL IS MASCULINE AND RICH.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 18 year old nephew he was so excited with it</li>
            <li>First saw it at a local men clothing store and my wife loved it on me, but they wanted almost $70 for the same product.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t spray too much for it can get pretty cloying.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong but easy and its lite buy heavy.</li>
            <li>Whoever blended this definitely knows what smells right on a man who&#x27;s adopted/wants a sexier, more mature persona.  </li>
            <li>It arrived on time but it doesn&#x27;t smell the same it smell light</li>
            <li>thanks again.</li>
            <li>EVERYONE wants to know what I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li>Package was in tack and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I have seen this Eau De Toilette for almost twice as much in the store.</li>
            <li>so much I want everyone I know to smell it,  </li>
            <li>i mean really good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better then the other ones everytime  </li>
            <li>There is absolutely nothing special about this fragrance that you would find appealing or memorable, just plain ordinary.</li>
            <li>1.7 Oz bottle for more than double if what I paid for this bottle which was double the size.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it for guys who are looking for quality colognes without having to pay a hefty price.  </li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s favorite everyday spray.</li>
            <li>It is a little strong if you spray too much &amp; too close</li>
            <li>To me that is reason enough to like it very much here.</li>
            <li>Smells sweet and aged.</li>
            <li>A little too strong for me.</li>
            <li>I own about 30 bottles in my collection, and i usually grab this when i am just out and about, hanging with friends and such.</li>
            <li>I love this cologne, sometimes it&#x27;s hard to find a store that sells it</li>
            <li>Slightly spice with a clean scent.  </li>
            <li>I bought it as a gift for a friend and so far he said he loves it.  </li>
            <li>They both like the cologne alot and my youngest son who is 5 years old</li>
            <li>and I found this at such a reasonable price and decided to buy this for him for Christmas.</li>
            <li>Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Enjoy the scent, not strong.</li>
            <li>and like it I can definitely recommend it on Amazon, which is mainly for the price.</li>
            <li>ALSO, YOU DON&#x27;T NEED  THAT MUCH BECAUSE THE SCENT LASTS A LONG TIME.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, so, try not to bathe in it and enjoy.  </li>
            <li>and I must admit that I am totally and completely dissatisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Subtle but long lasting, love it.</li>
            <li>All these colognes are fake, the bottles looks nothing like the real thing, smells absolutely nothing like the real thing</li>

            <li> He was a little reluctant to try it at first, but now he loves it, and the price I paid was great!</li>
            <li> ITS COOL TOO.</li>
            <li> When my husband sprayed some on and open the product he smelt so good</li>
            <li> Good stuff, but does not last all day</li>
            <li> However, the bottle that I received does not seem to be of full strength.  </li>
            <li> THIS IS MY NEW FAVORITE  </li>
            <li> Smells great, and it last all day long in the body and a lot of more time in clothes</li>
            <li> Love it, didn&#x27;t expect it to be the huge bottle for such as mall price</li>
            <li> It is well worth the price because we paid a lot&lt;br /&gt;more</li>
            <li> this 1 fell off some where but to me its worth about 15 bucks</li>
            <li> Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations.</li>
            <li> this has been one of my husband&#x27;s rare likes.</li>
            <li> but overall it was still pretty good reasonable price</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> :) I&#x27;ll definitely be getting him another when this bottle is finished.</li>
            <li> , I would never have ordered it in the first place.</li>
            <li> Would very much so highly reccomend this product to a friend no doubt!!</li>
            <li> When I first met my fianc&amp;eacute; he wore this.</li>
            <li> prices and quanity are the best can never go wrong.</li>
            <li> I MUST  SAY, ITS OFF THE CHARTS!THE SMELL IS MASCULINE AND RICH.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 18 year old nephew he was so excited with it</li>
            <li> First saw it at a local men clothing store and my wife loved it on me, but they wanted almost $70 for the same product.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spray too much for it can get pretty cloying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong but easy and its lite buy heavy.</li>
            <li> Whoever blended this definitely knows what smells right on a man who&#x27;s adopted/wants a sexier, more mature persona.  </li>
            <li> It arrived on time but it doesn&#x27;t smell the same it smell light</li>
            <li> thanks again.</li>
            <li> EVERYONE wants to know what I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li> Package was in tack and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I have seen this Eau De Toilette for almost twice as much in the store.</li>
            <li> so much I want everyone I know to smell it,  </li>
            <li> i mean really good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better then the other ones everytime  </li>
            <li> There is absolutely nothing special about this fragrance that you would find appealing or memorable, just plain ordinary.</li>
            <li> 1.7 Oz bottle for more than double if what I paid for this bottle which was double the size.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it for guys who are looking for quality colognes without having to pay a hefty price.  </li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite everyday spray.</li>
            <li> It is a little strong if you spray too much &amp; too close</li>
            <li> To me that is reason enough to like it very much here.</li>
            <li> Smells sweet and aged.</li>
            <li> A little too strong for me.</li>
            <li> I own about 30 bottles in my collection, and i usually grab this when i am just out and about, hanging with friends and such.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne, sometimes it&#x27;s hard to find a store that sells it</li>
            <li> Slightly spice with a clean scent.  </li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift for a friend and so far he said he loves it.  </li>
            <li> They both like the cologne alot and my youngest son who is 5 years old</li>
            <li> and I found this at such a reasonable price and decided to buy this for him for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Enjoy the scent, not strong.</li>
            <li> and like it I can definitely recommend it on Amazon, which is mainly for the price.</li>
            <li> ALSO, YOU DON&#x27;T NEED  THAT MUCH BECAUSE THE SCENT LASTS A LONG TIME.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so, try not to bathe in it and enjoy.  </li>
            <li> and I must admit that I am totally and completely dissatisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Subtle but long lasting, love it.</li>
            <li> All these colognes are fake, the bottles looks nothing like the real thing, smells absolutely nothing like the real thing</li>
            <li> The original packaging had very obviously been opened, as the seal was broken and the packaging was bent and beat up.</li>
            <li> I buy this stuff all the time this bottle must have sat for awhile doesn&#x27;t smell quite as good :-(.</li>
            <li> The bottle is strangely collectable..?  </li>
            <li> The only scent I can remotely compare Usher&#x27;s VIP to is \\&quot;Grey Flannel\\&quot;-</li>
            <li> worst of all the scent doesn&#x27;t even last for a good ten minutes.</li>
            <li> Hard to find item at a price I can live with.  </li>
            <li> In other words, it may have been sitting on the shelf too long since I need to spray a lot.</li>
            <li> I say well this stuff is expensive (but its not) but its worth its.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne for my husband who has been using it for a few years, and it does not smell like what he has been using prior to this package.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t last long worse of all.</li>
            <li> Either the cologne is old or bootleg.</li>
            <li> The deodorant was even placed upside down.</li>
            <li> This has moderate projection and longevity is under two hours, this is just cheap crap!</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift a few years ago</li>
            <li> I am shocked at how much attention this scent has gotten me- unwarranted, but, flattering attention at that.  </li>
            <li> no more then 15</li>
            <li> &amp; I do mean &amp;#34;NOTHING&amp;#34; &amp;</li>
            <li> I mean the nose of the beholder.</li>
            <li> Very subtle in my opinion not over powering</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m out $30 and stuck with a worthless, previously used gift that I would never give to someone.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this smell.</li>
            <li> Either way, I am a disgruntled customer,  unable to return the product because of its flammable contents.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed with it when I received it in the mail.</li>

THE WOMEN LOVE IT!!!!!DON&#x27;T FORGET TO CHECK OUT THE TOP,  IF YOU FLICK THE TOP OFF, THERE IS A RING AND ITS COOL TOO.( I HEAR USHER  WEARS THE RING AS WELL)</li>
            <li> I love it. It&#x27;s better then the other ones everytime  I wear it people ask what u got on</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne that my husband wears.  It is smooth and enticing without being over powering.  VIP is definitely a winner!!</li>
            <li> I simply love the smell of this cologne on my husband...I gave it to him as one of his Christmas gifts. He was a little reluctant to try it at first, but now he loves it, and the price I paid was great!</li>
            <li> Gift for my husband. Love the scent. Enjoy the scent, not strong. Nice smooth smell.</li>
            <li> Yes I was very satisfied with  Usher VIP, smell good and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> Very nice, smoothly odor, takes almost a week before go away.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this fragance.  It is well worth the price because we paid a lot&lt;br /&gt;more in a dept store.</li>
            <li> I am shocked at how much attention this scent has gotten me- unwarranted, but, flattering attention at that.  The only scent I can remotely compare Usher&#x27;s VIP to is \\&quot;Grey Flannel\\&quot;- it&#x27;s that unique.  Whoever blended this definitely knows what smells right on a man who&#x27;s adopted/wants a sexier, more mature persona.  A little goes a long way, so, try not to bathe in it and enjoy.  Side Note: The bottle is strangely collectable..?  Just thought I would say.</li>
            <li> Love it, didn&#x27;t expect it to be the huge bottle for such as mall price 👍👍👍👍👍</li>
            <li> Tried this cologne at Macy&#x27;s and thought it was great. Was very disappointed with it when I received it in the mail. A little too strong for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not 100 percent sure what can be said about this the first 2 are really good i mean really good this 1 fell off some where but to me its worth about 15 bucks no more then 15</li>
            <li> This cologne smells like heaven. I absolutely love it and will continue to buy it! Great price for a scent that lasts all day!</li>
            <li> very sexy smell. I purchased it for my boyfriend birthday - he loves the scent.</li>
            <li> This fragrance rocks!  Third bottle I&#x27;ve bought for hubby since discovering it.  He constantly gets compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Hubby loves this cologne smells amazing</li>
            <li> Smells just like it should</li>
            <li> The Usher VIP Fragrance for Men has a Heaveny smell and the price was excellent for a 100 ml bottle which you will not find in any store. I am glad I bought it - and will do so again after this one finishes. Highly recommend it for guys who are looking for quality colognes without having to pay a hefty price.  Women love the smell too!!.</li>
            <li> Great price my husbands favorite cologne</li>
            <li> I buy this stuff all the time this bottle must have sat for awhile doesn&#x27;t smell quite as good :-(.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 18 year old nephew he was so excited with it and it smells great he liked the bottle style.</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend and it smells soooooooo good that he uses it every day :) I&#x27;ll definitely be getting him another when this bottle is finished.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne, sometimes it&#x27;s hard to find a store that sells it and that&#x27;s why I ordered it on here. The smell is amazing. The longevity of the smell is the only downside, it dies out after 3 to 4 hours or so. But while it&#x27;s on you it will definitely get you compliments.</li>
            <li> All these colognes are fake, the bottles looks nothing like the real thing, smells absolutely nothing like the real thing &amp; I do mean &amp;#34;NOTHING&amp;#34; &amp; worst of all the scent doesn&#x27;t even last for a good ten minutes. All they do is take your money &amp; rip u off by deceiving customers telling them their stuff is authentic when it&#x27;s all fakes &amp; knock offs. DO NOT BUY cause ur gonna be so pissed off</li>
            <li> My fiance wears this ! We both love the way it smells ! And at such a good price too !</li>
            <li> Hard to find item at a price I can live with.  I still get compliments every time I wear it.</li>
            <li> This is the sexiest smell my husband owns. I love love love it!! The smell last all day! This product is for sure, Ushers best!</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift a few years ago and I buy it from time to time to rotate the colognes that I wear.  I do like this one because it is not over powering like some colognes, which is what I like.  I am not a fan of the ones where you spray it on you and then you smell for a week from it.  This one is perfect and the price was great.</li>
            <li> Smells very good. I own about 30 bottles in my collection, and i usually grab this when i am just out and about, hanging with friends and such. Don&#x27;t spray too much for it can get pretty cloying.</li>
            <li> The price should have been $20.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time but it doesn&#x27;t smell the same it smell light and it doesn&#x27;t last long worse of all.</li>
            <li> Awesome scent and delivery time was asap thanks again.</li>
            <li> Got this for Christmas by my girlfriend. Now I don&#x27;t want to wear anything else. EVERYONE wants to know what I&#x27;m wearing. Bottom line. Get this.</li>
            <li> I love this smell so does my wife. She can&#x27;t keep her hands off me as well as others. Lol. Jk.</li>
            <li> but I love this cologne on my man. If this is how Usher smells I would fore sure be fan</li>
            <li> I recently ordered this cologne as a Christmas gift. The item is listed and pictured as being only a 3.4 oz bottle of cologne, but instead I received the cologne, deodorant and aftershave lotion. This would have been a nice bonus had the item not arrived USED. The original packaging had very obviously been opened, as the seal was broken and the packaging was bent and beat up. The deodorant was even placed upside down. If I decided to actually go ahead and give this used item as a Christmas gift, I would have to repackage it entirely just to make it presentable. I tried to return the item to Amazon, only to get the following response:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com. Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations. Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had I known the item was unreturnable (and that it was going to arrive USED), I would never have ordered it in the first place. Now I&#x27;m out $30 and stuck with a worthless, previously used gift that I would never give to someone.</li>
            <li> This is the only cologne the I like for my husband to wear so I always buy 2 so that he will always have it on hand.</li>
            <li> Smells great, and it last all day long in the body and a lot of more time in clothes</li>
            <li> I have not personally try this one on me.  I bought it as a gift for a friend and so far he said he loves it.  So 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Subtle but long lasting, love it.</li>
            <li> Has a very cheap scent, I use Usher cologne and thought I would try out Vip, will not buy it again..  Has a strong, cheap smell that you would get out of any $5 bottle for kids.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells like heaven. I absolutely love it and will continue to buy it! Great price for a scent that lasts all day!</li>
            <li> I looked in stores just about everywhere, and this is the best deal i could find for Usher VIP. At most places this is $50 or more or its $27 for one once! This is a great deal, and i would recomend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Very subtle in my opinion not over powering and I always get compliments when wearing it.</li>
            <li> Love Usher fragrance, for the price you can&#x27;t believe.  Regret on not purchasing more than one. Will recommend others.</li>
            <li> I am writing this review as I am wearing ‘Usher Vip by Usher for Men’, I have been using it for over four days now and I must admit that I am totally and completely dissatisfied with this product. There is absolutely nothing special about this fragrance that you would find appealing or memorable, just plain ordinary. I cannot and will not recommend this cologne to anyone.  This has moderate projection and longevity is under two hours, this is just cheap crap!</li>
            <li> great smell and good price</li>
            <li> excellent perfume smells very well recommend</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne for my fiance and he loves it! It smells great and the price was right so go ahead and order yo some the bottle is a nice size as well.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite everyday spray.</li>
            <li> Smells sweet and aged. I still say Usher Black the best, but Vip is almost equally great in a matured state. The cologne you wear to smell dignified and smooth.  More like a businessman with style. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!!!! great pricing, delivere dontime. would order from this seller again</li>
            <li> Great arrived on time exactly what I ordered and smells great, wear it everyday Would very much so highly reccomend this product to a friend no doubt!!</li>
            <li> First I want to say this seller is the best. The product came in super quick after 3 days and then the items I got was just amazing, I was expecting just the spray and got body wash and cream. When my husband sprayed some on and open the product he smelt so good I was all over him for the entire day. Great service, quick and great price!!! Thank U!!</li>
            <li> I love the way this smells and this has been one of my husband&#x27;s rare likes. We have been looking for this cologne for a while and I am glad I found it on here. Package was in tack and fast delivery. Thank you. I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I wanted the actual box with caps and I was given the tester bottles but overall it was still pretty good reasonable price</li>
            <li> I love the Smell of VIP by USHER its very attractive to the ladies they always say man you smell good were you get it. I say well this stuff is expensive (but its not) but its worth its.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne for my husband who has been using it for a few years, and it does not smell like what he has been using prior to this package. Either the cologne is old or bootleg. Either way, I am a disgruntled customer,  unable to return the product because of its flammable contents.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband once before &amp; much more for it, love the bottle size &amp; price, oh &amp; it smells great as well, love it for my man.</li>
            <li> Usher VIP is a unique clean fragrance! Love it! When wearing Usher VIP I have gotten lots of compliments! Totally awsome fragrance!</li>
            <li> I bought one gave it to my brother and had to buy another one for myself. One of the best Usher cologne out there. Ladies love it too!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend as a birthday gift &amp; he loved it ! It is a little strong if you spray too much &amp; too close but if you have just about the right spray &amp; distance it smells great!</li>
            <li> Because its very elegant cologne for men...Its what my husband wanted for a while. Since Macy stop carrying the fragrance.</li>
            <li> My OFFICIAL all time fav cologne! Neva changin it!</li>
            <li> I brought this cologne for my father and my boyfriend for father&#x27;s day. They both like the cologne alot and my youngest son who is 5 years old like to wear it also. He thinks it makes him smell liks a grown up. lol</li>
            <li> i like it it an so did the ladys.im going to get some more asap.try it an see for your self</li>
            <li> all very good , good price</li>
            <li> As for beauty also the charm of this fragrance lies in the eye - I mean the nose of the beholder. If you can test the product somewhere and like it I can definitely recommend it on Amazon, which is mainly for the price. I have seen this Eau De Toilette for almost twice as much in the store. To me that is reason enough to like it very much here.</li>
            <li> When I first met my fianc&amp;eacute; he wore this. It smells amazing on him! He started to run out and I found this at such a reasonable price and decided to buy this for him for Christmas. He was really happy to have more!</li>
            <li> Perfect.. All eyes on you when you wear this!</li>
            <li> I had the cologne , which I bought from a retail chain. 1.7 Oz bottle for more than double if what I paid for this bottle which was double the size. No complaints here. Amazon came through again!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my boyfriend  for Valentines Day, and he loves it!&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase it again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> Some of the best cologne by usher, I love it, so much I want everyone I know to smell it,  I wear it ll the time morning noon and night.&lt;br /&gt;good price from amazon.  If you want amazon has lot of cologne to bye on there web site in larger sizes in a cheaper price, I&lt;br /&gt;rarely buy from anyone else. prices and quanity are the best can never go wrong.</li>
            <li> women love the smell .</li>
            <li> Good stuff, but does not last all day, you have to keep putting it on every three hours or so</li>
            <li> Great scent ... I like it!</li>
            <li> Smells nice and loved it. It feel like I&#x27;m wearing a million buck!~ haha, Absolutely brilliant product! I think I will have another one once I run out of it. Price was pretty good!~</li>
            <li> This has a great fragrance, perhaps the best ever.  However, the bottle that I received does not seem to be of full strength.  In other words, it may have been sitting on the shelf too long since I need to spray a lot.</li>
            <li> Excellent price for a great scent.  First saw it at a local men clothing store and my wife loved it on me, but they wanted almost $70 for the same product.  Slightly spice with a clean scent.  Great for work and a night out, not very casual.</li>
            <li> Great scent different from others I have .good compliments from others. Would definitely buy this again and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is the actual cologne and not some mall kiosk smell-a-like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gotten more compliments about smelling good from friends and strangers wearing this than I ever have before.  If you&#x27;re looking to smell good, get this.  Just don&#x27;t wear it around me, this is MY scent.</li>
            <li> Great product, good price smells goo!</li>
            <li> The enterance smell is great but when it resignates in your head it smells like body odor. Like legit. Grossss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying Usher&#x27;s colognes for years now and this one takes the cake. It&#x27;s strong but easy and its lite buy heavy. I spray some of this stough on every day. A++++ Usher VIP.</li>
