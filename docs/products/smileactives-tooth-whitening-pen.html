            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s good for that.</li>
            <li>I NEVER write reviews on products even if they&#x27;re good, and I know this review reads like its from an employee of the company.</li>

            <li>This pen is great to keep my teeth free of coffee stains, I don&#x27;t drink wine</li>
            <li>Easy &amp; quick to use, I experienced no tooth sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>More of a maintenance item.</li>
            <li>Love u Amazon People</li>
            <li>you will get a better result.</li>
            <li>This products does even MORE than advertised...worth every dime &amp; more.</li>
            <li>and I was pleased with the outcome</li>
            <li>and I love them.  </li>
            <li>went to purchase 2 more pens and discover it would cost 30 percent more from qvc by the time you pay shipping and tax.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do drink coffee each day, and maybe the results would be greater if I had not.  </li>
            <li>husband love it...</li>
            <li>will probably order more</li>
            <li>Works great and doesn&#x27;t make your teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li>easy to use...</li>
            <li>That is important to know.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and really whitens teeth many shades whiter ...</li>
            <li>The original QVC pen was clinical strength.</li>
            <li>burn, must using good chapstick will dry out your lips, otherwise no gum or tooth burn or sensitivity.</li>
            <li>my teeth didnt whiten very much.</li>
            <li>actually does what the company says it will do &amp; more.</li>
            <li>However, not a dramatic change in color, maybe 1 to 2 shades of whitening.</li>
            <li>We have tried this a couple times in the last couple of years and both times a full success.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s gentle on the gums.</li>
            <li>Because I smoke &amp; drink coffee/tea every day my teeth were really yellowed; I tried whitening strips, whitening toothpaste, even the kit w/teeth forms &amp; bleach...</li>
            <li>really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen a very gradual lightening in my teeth, and the pen is almost all used up.  </li>
            <li>I really did not notice that much of a difference.</li>
            <li>SO I was skeptical about this pen thing , but it actually works really good!</li>
            <li>I will continue purchasing from the seller as long as the price is right.</li>
            <li>I didnt believe it, but after using it for awhile my teeth arent sensitive &amp; doesnt seem to affect my enamel.</li>
            <li>For a few dollars more than the pack of whitening strips from Walmart, thought I&#x27;d give them a try, especially because they&#x27;re so portable.</li>
            <li>Did find a different vendor on Amazon who offers it for a lower price</li>
            <li>The yellow hue is still apparent.</li>
            <li>I previously had the Smileactives vibrating whitening pen and it seemed to make my teeth much whiter.  </li>

            <li> As far as I know the product is working or at least keeping my teeth from turning yellow.  </li>
            <li> Pro&#x27;s It works 20yr smoker coffee, red wine, red lipstick results using recommended 3-4 daily at least 3 shades lighter in 5 days.</li>
            <li> picks to use to dip in and get small enough product to use , Also try not to got on outer lips</li>
            <li> using other whitening products I was concerned about stripping the enamel off my teeth or tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I have been using Smileactives for 10 days, applying it 3x a day and have noticed a slight improvement in the brightness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> This is a watered down version and a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of using Smileactives 2 - 5 times a day I could not believe how white my teeth were...at least 10 shades whiter!</li>
            <li> I continue to use them twice a day for maintenance &amp; my teeth are still getting a little whiter</li>
            <li> I have purchased quite a few of the smileactives and have been please.  </li>
            <li> My guess is that AMAZON kept the product on their shelf  beyond the time limit so it dried out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years now and it has brightened my teeth by a few shades.</li>
            <li> try i had to buy a small brush like tooth</li>
            <li> I noticed that my teeth became dull when I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Within 2 days of using it on my teeth, probably about 5 times in one day, they were at least 3 shades whiter.</li>
            <li> This pen was not good at all</li>
            <li> it by your standards is not fair........</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve written this review because I&#x27;m really shocked a product</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> For me, this products helps to  whiten after my morning coffee. Easy &amp; quick to use, I experienced no tooth sensitivity.  However, not a dramatic change in color, maybe 1 to 2 shades of whitening. More of a maintenance item.</li>
            <li> This pen is great to keep my teeth free of coffee stains, I don&#x27;t drink wine so I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s good for that.</li>
            <li> I previously had the Smileactives vibrating whitening pen and it seemed to make my teeth much whiter.  This pen was not good at all it did nothing, I want to return, I was out of town for one month and just returned so only recently tried the pen.&lt;br /&gt;Please let me know if you have the smileactives vibrating pen&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;Wendy Fischer</li>
            <li> Pro&#x27;s It works 20yr smoker coffee, red wine, red lipstick results using recommended 3-4 daily at least 3 shades lighter in 5 days. Shipped perfect on time no problem&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s As everyone else noted the push up/twister mechinism broke on the 3rd try i had to buy a small brush like tooth picks to use to dip in and get small enough product to use , Also try not to got on outer lips burn, must using good chapstick will dry out your lips, otherwise no gum or tooth burn or sensitivity. Love u Amazon People</li>
            <li> I have purchased quite a few of the smileactives and have been please.  As far as I know the product is working or at least keeping my teeth from turning yellow.  I will continue purchasing from the seller as long as the price is right.</li>
            <li> The original QVC pen was clinical strength. This is a watered down version and a waste of time and money. If you used 50/50 hydrogen peroxide (3%)/baking soda for 2 minutes you will get a better result.</li>
            <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t make your teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li> Best teeth whitener out there ... Easy to use and really whitens teeth many shades whiter ... I am a repeat buyer of this product ... I would recommend this !</li>
            <li> come on, it works great...smile !</li>
            <li> The description didn&#x27;t say that you shouldn&#x27;t use the pen while wearing braces so I haven&#x27;t got to use it yet. I gave it 4 stars because that should have been stated in the description like it is in the pamphlet that came with the pen. That is important to know.</li>
            <li> We have tried this a couple times in the last couple of years and both times a full success. You have to use it religiously and it&#x27;s gentle on the gums. We saw a big difference after 24-36 hours.</li>
            <li> I have been using Smileactives for 10 days, applying it 3x a day and have noticed a slight improvement in the brightness of my teeth. The yellow hue is still apparent.</li>
            <li> This products does even MORE than advertised...worth every dime &amp; more. First time I ordered them, it was from one of those home shopping networks, 5 in a kit, for maybe a little less than the prices on Amazon. For a few dollars more than the pack of whitening strips from Walmart, thought I&#x27;d give them a try, especially because they&#x27;re so portable. Within 2 days of using it on my teeth, probably about 5 times in one day, they were at least 3 shades whiter. Because I smoke &amp; drink coffee/tea every day my teeth were really yellowed; I tried whitening strips, whitening toothpaste, even the kit w/teeth forms &amp; bleach...they did nothing. Even when I got my teeth polished by the dentist my teeth didnt whiten very much. After 2 weeks of using Smileactives 2 - 5 times a day I could not believe how white my teeth were...at least 10 shades whiter! I continue to use them twice a day for maintenance &amp; my teeth are still getting a little whiter every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using other whitening products I was concerned about stripping the enamel off my teeth or tooth sensitivity. Even though this company claims wont damage enamel I didnt believe it, but after using it for awhile my teeth arent sensitive &amp; doesnt seem to affect my enamel. For Xmas I&#x27;m buying more pens to give to all my friends, its that good! I NEVER write reviews on products even if they&#x27;re good, and I know this review reads like its from an employee of the company. I&#x27;ve written this review because I&#x27;m really shocked a product actually does what the company says it will do &amp; more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product before from QVC, I know what it is suppose to do and I was pleased with the outcome so perhaps&lt;br /&gt;judging it by your standards is not fair........the product you sent to me was DRY and thus would not even spread on the&lt;br /&gt;teeth.  My guess is that AMAZON kept the product on their shelf  beyond the time limit so it dried out.Would there be&lt;br /&gt;any recourse Smileactives?</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product.  Several friends have noticed my teeth are whiter.  I use it mornings on my drive to work!</li>
            <li> Easy, no sensitivity, tastes pleasant!</li>
            <li> Purchases 2 pens from qvc a while back and I love them.  I used them after zoom treatment for maintenance and brought them to trip to Italy where we did a lot of red wine drinking.  I works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to purchase 2 more pens and discover it would cost 30 percent more from qvc by the time you pay shipping and tax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product at a great price on amazon prime.</li>
            <li> SO I was skeptical about this pen thing , but it actually works really good! I use it every morning and night before bed and I have noticed results. The product wasn&#x27;t what it looks like in the picture but It still works great. It didn&#x27;t take too long to receive the package either. I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Works great! Finally a whitener that works!</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years now and it has brightened my teeth by a few shades. I noticed that my teeth became dull when I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these pens, one for myself and one for my husband.  I&#x27;ve seen a very gradual lightening in my teeth, and the pen is almost all used up.  I do drink coffee each day, and maybe the results would be greater if I had not.  Overall though, I believe the product does what&#x27;s described.</li>
            <li> I have been using Smileactives for some months, but the vendor no longer carries it.  So, I tried your web site and found it.  Thank You.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this too long yet but I think it is working.  I don&#x27;t like to hassle with the strips or trays and my dentist says whitening toothpaste doesn&#x27;t work.  So I&#x27;ll keep using this for now.  Did find a different vendor on Amazon who offers it for a lower price but I didn&#x27;t check out shipping costs since I have plenty for now.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> hubby gift.....easy to use...husband love it... will probably order more...wish I had samples of the newer version  then i would would probably start ordering them</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and chose to purchase this product. After using, I didn&#x27;t see a noticeable difference. My teeth aren&#x27;t yellow by any means, but I just wanted a touch up. I didn&#x27;t notice any chance after using the product.</li>
            <li> I really did not notice that much of a difference. The product only lasts about two weeks and that is using it twice a day.</li>
