    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It is the best one out there in my opinion.....</li>
            <li>If you think you can handle the smell, this product will be great for you.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find this one.....</li>
            <li>Not tasty but very effective.</li>
            <li>I have used many balms of this product by Desert Essence and can honestly say they are the best.</li>
            <li>Seems like a good product.  </li>
            <li>It still feels good when I put it on though.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell good</li>
            <li>but it does keep my lips in good condition during the weather changes.  </li>
            <li>and he&#x27;s tried a great many over the years.</li>
            <li>Love this!  </li>
            <li>This is the best product I&#x27;ve found so far.  </li>
            <li>Nice smooth chapstick.  </li>
            <li>I always make sure I travel with it.  </li>
            <li>OK results are in, as of 13 Apr 15</li>
            <li>other than that it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>but thats fine.</li>
            <li>The taste is different and takes some getting used to, but it works great.  </li>
            <li>I have not been able to get my sons to use it since the first time because of the smell.</li>
            <li>I a still looking for the perfect lip balm for New Mexico&#x27;s dry climate</li>
            <li>makes my lips all nice and soft</li>
            <li>It worked great, after having no success with Chapstick and its imitators.</li>
            <li>It does have a tea tree smell, not quite as strong as the pure tea tree oil you can get (that doesn&#x27;t bother me).</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m struggling to order a new supply without paying more for shipping than the cost of the lip balm.  </li>
            <li>It gives relief right away.</li>
            <li>lol Not sure,</li>
            <li>This product, unfortunately, is not vegan (as is said in the product description).</li>
            <li>It has a very creamy texture but smells like minty dirt!</li>
            <li>Then, in looking at the ingredients, the first ingredient is soybean oil.  </li>
            <li>Anyways, it does make my lips soft, but I do have to put it on more frequently compared to a normal over the counter lip treatment for chapped lips.</li>
            <li>However, for the hassles to find it at a reasonable price, I have lowered my satisfaction to four stars.  </li>
            <li>Right, it tastes bad, but it is the absolute best.</li>
            <li>The tea tree oil in the formulation seems to help heal and then prevent that rash more than any other lip product he&#x27;s tried-</li>
            <li>this balm helps some, but I have to apply it pretty often to keep my lips soft as they still peel.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without em!</li>
            <li>Not the greatest smell or taste but a sacrifice any cold sore victim should be willing to take.</li>
            <li>I guess I could say, it is the best I&#x27;ve tried so far and the flavor isn&#x27;t too bad...</li>
            <li>Not bad, but certainly not feminine.  </li>
            <li>This product is petrolatum FREE and have moisturized my lips uncompromisingly well over any other lip balm I have used or sold!!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t seem to bother me.  </li>
            <li>I originally marked 5 stars for the quality &amp; appreciation I have for the product.  </li>
            <li>Why is it so difficult to find a good product.  </li>
            <li>It really helps for dry lips.  </li>
            <li>It also feels a bit rough on my lips when I put it on, kind of feels like tiny bits of sand being rubbed on, but after a few minutes that gritty feeling on my lips goes away.</li>
            <li>I use it a few times a day.  &amp; rarely have a problem.  </li>
            <li>During periods of high intensity sun exposure I recommend a balm containing a SPF rating of at least 15 or higher.</li>

            <li> The slippery feeling doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like it to</li>
            <li> Buy them 6 or a dozen at a time even though they last long.</li>
            <li> This ingredient will actually further dry out your lips.</li>
            <li> my daughter tells me that the product really dries out her lips, and the smell is not very pleasant.</li>
            <li> Having a history of cold sores I&#x27;ve found the Tea Tree Lip Rescue to be the most helpful prevention &amp; treatment.  </li>
            <li> I kept getting either little cold sores or some kind of rash on my lips this spring.</li>
            <li> and my lips are constantly dry and chapped.</li>
            <li> My lips are always dry, even though I drink a lot of water...</li>
            <li> I have not had a single one!</li>
            <li> Ironically, I am now addicted to the energizing taste and aroma of pure Tea Tree Oil.</li>
            <li> I simply detest getting cold sores and having such strong emotions towards them truly only makes the infection worse.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve only used this lip rescue with tea tree oil stick for a few days.</li>
            <li> I have wondered if mold in the environment was part of the problem with my chronically chapped and cracked lips, as well as some rough skin spots and severe resperatory problems.  </li>
            <li> When I woke up this morning, the taste was alarming</li>
            <li> I order this product is one that is a different scent since I&#x27;m not a huge fan of eucalyptus scents, but</li>
            <li> So now in an attempt to heal them and my other symptoms, I tried this.  </li>
            <li> Living in Arizona, the climate is extremely dry year round</li>
            <li> As we can all see, cheap can make you sick.</li>
            <li> And I am a person who has gotten them since I was a little girl.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday for my lips.  </li>
            <li> and I walk everyday, so they get harsh treatment...</li>
            <li> Lip Rescue has saved me from a few out breaks, and has controlled others from spreading.</li>
            <li> but you need to know that it has the most disgusting smell.</li>
            <li> Not sure that she will be continuing to use the products.</li>
            <li> Plus I believe the tea tree oil prevents secondary infections</li>
            <li> I use it only when I feel a cold sore coming.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this because I have constant problems with cold sores, so I have started using it after I got over my last set of cold sores.</li>
            <li> It will not cure your cold sores as there is yet any such thing</li>
            <li> We all know lipstick and lip balm is ultimately &#x27;consumed&#x27; by the person who uses it, it would appear this is a dangerous product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it I must admit I hated the taste and the aroma.</li>
            <li> I buy this lip balm for my son who gets a painful, red rash around his lips during the winter months.  </li>
            <li> for me it had a terrible scent/flavor, i stopped using it quickly as my lips were just getting worse using it.  </li>
            <li> The texture is thin, not waxy or creamy.</li>
            <li> I will update in a few weeks if it helps with chronic cold sores.</li>
            <li> Even children will put up with the taste because they can play in the cold outdoors with chapped lips.</li>
            <li> This Chapstick was recommended as a way to heal lips and prevent cold sores.  </li>
            <li> I lick them a lot in cold weather</li>
            <li> I get cold sores every two to three weeks.</li>
            <li> I learned about using chapstick with tea tree oils because they help prevent cold sores.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad tube</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if this is one bad tube</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve just gone through mold remediation in our home, because my husband and I have been horribly sick, and then they found mold so bad that we shouldn&#x27;t even be here!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Nice smooth chapstick.  The tea tree is not overpowering.  Seems like a good product.  I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t seem to bother me.  The slippery feeling doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like it to but thats fine.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this.  It reminds me of the solid tea tree oil cream which turns to liquid after putting on which is by same company. It gives relief right away. I will probably continue to use this. UPDATE;  After using this for quite some time  I have found it still has a drying affect. I guess it is the tea tree oil as it can be drying.  It still feels good when I put it on though. Don&#x27;t they all! I a still looking for the perfect lip balm for New Mexico&#x27;s dry climate</li>
            <li> I use this everyday for my lips.  Doesn&#x27;t smell good but it does keep my lips in good condition during the weather changes.  I have not been able to get my sons to use it since the first time because of the smell.</li>
            <li> This product, unfortunately, is not vegan (as is said in the product description). It also says \\&quot;No Animal Derived Ingredients\\&quot;, but contains beeswax. 1-star for inaccurate product information.</li>
            <li> Right, it tastes bad, but it is the absolute best. Even children will put up with the taste because they can play in the cold outdoors with chapped lips. Plus I believe the tea tree oil prevents secondary infections</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it I must admit I hated the taste and the aroma. Living in Arizona, the climate is extremely dry year round and my lips are constantly dry and chapped. I have used many balms of this product by Desert Essence and can honestly say they are the best. I used to work for a Fortune 500 company selling skin care products and tanning lotions including lip balms. I learned to use ONLY balms that do not contain petrolatums. This ingredient will actually further dry out your lips. This product is petrolatum FREE and have moisturized my lips uncompromisingly well over any other lip balm I have used or sold!! During periods of high intensity sun exposure I recommend a balm containing a SPF rating of at least 15 or higher. Ironically, I am now addicted to the energizing taste and aroma of pure Tea Tree Oil. Can&#x27;t live without em!</li>
            <li> Smells like a forest mixed with man&#x27;s cologne.  Not bad, but certainly not feminine.  I use it only when I feel a cold sore coming.  The texture is thin, not waxy or creamy.</li>
            <li> This Chapstick was recommended as a way to heal lips and prevent cold sores.  I kept getting either little cold sores or some kind of rash on my lips this spring. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s allergies or what.  I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It seemed to help but you need to know that it has the most disgusting smell. It made me shudder every time I put it on. It has a very creamy texture but smells like minty dirt! If you think you can handle the smell, this product will be great for you.</li>
            <li> My lips are always dry, even though I drink a lot of water...I lick them a lot in cold weather and I walk everyday, so they get harsh treatment...this balm helps some, but I have to apply it pretty often to keep my lips soft as they still peel.  I guess I could say, it is the best I&#x27;ve tried so far and the flavor isn&#x27;t too bad...I ordered the one with shea butter also, but haven&#x27;t tried it.</li>
            <li> for me it had a terrible scent/flavor, i stopped using it quickly as my lips were just getting worse using it.  Maybe it will work for someone else.</li>
            <li> Having a history of cold sores I&#x27;ve found the Tea Tree Lip Rescue to be the most helpful prevention &amp; treatment.  Upon application, tea tree seems to hydrate instead of drying up or coating.  I use it a few times a day.  &amp; rarely have a problem.  I recently ordered my replacements from the CB Select (an Amazon vender) &amp; I received shea butter instead of tea tree lip balm.  I&#x27;ve spent nearly a month returning &amp; straitening out the miss order.  I finally gave up &amp; received a refund today.  Now I&#x27;m struggling to order a new supply without paying more for shipping than the cost of the lip balm.  I originally marked 5 stars for the quality &amp; appreciation I have for the product.  However, for the hassles to find it at a reasonable price, I have lowered my satisfaction to four stars.  I may find by the end of this process it&#x27;s between a two &amp; three star experience.  Why is it so difficult to find a good product.  I used to go to a local health store &amp; pick it up in person.  They all stopped carrying this product.  So now I have to internet order it.  That&#x27;s it!  I&#x27;m giving it three stars for difficulty to access.</li>
            <li> Love this!  It really helps for dry lips.  This is the best product I&#x27;ve found so far.  I always make sure I travel with it.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that I wish it had some sunblock in it.</li>
            <li> Only one that works for me</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I have constant problems with cold sores, so I have started using it after I got over my last set of cold sores. It does have a tea tree smell, not quite as strong as the pure tea tree oil you can get (that doesn&#x27;t bother me). Anyways, it does make my lips soft, but I do have to put it on more frequently compared to a normal over the counter lip treatment for chapped lips. It also feels a bit rough on my lips when I put it on, kind of feels like tiny bits of sand being rubbed on, but after a few minutes that gritty feeling on my lips goes away. So maybe it&#x27;s something that helps the lips, maybe exfoliate the lips? lol Not sure, but I&#x27;ve only used this lip rescue with tea tree oil stick for a few days. I will update in a few weeks if it helps with chronic cold sores. I&#x27;ll know, I get cold sores every two to three weeks.</li>
            <li> I buy this lip balm for my son who gets a painful, red rash around his lips during the winter months.  The tea tree oil in the formulation seems to help heal and then prevent that rash more than any other lip product he&#x27;s tried- and he&#x27;s tried a great many over the years.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a lip balm with tea tree oil for years.  I was so happy to find this one.....It is the best one out there in my opinion.....I bought ten so I would have them for awhile.</li>
            <li> I learned about using chapstick with tea tree oils because they help prevent cold sores. And I am a person who has gotten them since I was a little girl. Since using Lip Rescue I have not had a single one! One thing I would like to get next time I order this product is one that is a different scent since I&#x27;m not a huge fan of eucalyptus scents, but other than that it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> The taste is different and takes some getting used to, but it works great.  Leaves lips tingling and moisturized.  I will definitely recommend this product to family and friends.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll never want to be without this once you&#x27;ve tried it. Buy them 6 or a dozen at a time even though they last long. Not tasty but very effective.</li>
            <li> makes my lips all nice and soft</li>
            <li> I simply detest getting cold sores and having such strong emotions towards them truly only makes the infection worse. Lip Rescue has saved me from a few out breaks, and has controlled others from spreading. It will not cure your cold sores as there is yet any such thing but it will totally soften your lips. Not the greatest smell or taste but a sacrifice any cold sore victim should be willing to take.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad tube or if it&#x27;s the nature of the product, but this stuff tastes moldy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can sniff out mold anywhere.  We&#x27;ve just gone through mold remediation in our home, because my husband and I have been horribly sick, and then they found mold so bad that we shouldn&#x27;t even be here! I have wondered if mold in the environment was part of the problem with my chronically chapped and cracked lips, as well as some rough skin spots and severe resperatory problems.  So now in an attempt to heal them and my other symptoms, I tried this.  Now I find it tastes like mold!  Even the tea tree oil can&#x27;t hide it! When I woke up this morning, the taste was alarming and I&#x27;m having mold symptoms again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if this is one bad tube or if it is a problem with the ingredients.  The biggest problem I have with the ingredients is that nothing is organic.  Then, in looking at the ingredients, the first ingredient is soybean oil.  The majority of soybeans planted in this country are now GMO, which is toxic.  We all know lipstick and lip balm is ultimately &#x27;consumed&#x27; by the person who uses it, it would appear this is a dangerous product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m trying another brand, Qtica , whenever it is delivered.  Sure, it&#x27;s expensive but I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s an indicator of the quality of the product.  As we can all see, cheap can make you sick.</li>
            <li> My daughter purchased this for her use. Results to be determined! OK results are in, as of 13 Apr 15 my daughter tells me that the product really dries out her lips, and the smell is not very pleasant. Not sure that she will be continuing to use the products.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended lip balm with tea tree oil for chapped lips. It worked great, after having no success with Chapstick and its imitators.</li>
