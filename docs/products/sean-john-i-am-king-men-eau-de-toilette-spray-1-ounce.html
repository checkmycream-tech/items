            <li> Smells great good product</li>
            <li> The men on our trip LOVED this cologne.</li>
            <li> My husband loved this and i loved that i found it on sale</li>
            <li> Smells good for about 5 minute,  Then the smell disappears just like your money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li> Exactly what&#x27;s described great purchase</li>
            <li> This product does not smell at all like the actual I Am King cologne. They have right there in their add that they sell 100% authentic fragrances. I have returned these items and would caution anyone from going through this company. No wonder they were such a good price. Fake, bland scented cologne.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend it at all, bought it today and it smells like fricking water,  there&#x27;s no smell to it, you literally have to marinate yourself in it to be able to smell it . The people that wrote these reviews on how good it is are in on it :/ , how low you have to be to trick people like that . I got it only because unforgivable was sold out and am extremely disappointed .</li>
            <li> Like the fragrance. Amazon saved me about $10 over what I found at local stores.</li>
            <li> Smells delicious! So fresh</li>
            <li> Awesome cologne, smells great, not too strong. Great value. Paid way more for this cologne in the past at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It smells heavenly but after about an hour you have to be up close and personal to smell it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping great product..</li>
            <li> It arrived before it was supposed to during the Christmas rush and when it came the smell was amazing! Well worth every dollar!</li>
            <li> I love it! They sell it at the rite aid by me for $16 more than what I paid but I got a deal here. I absolutely love the scent. It&#x27;s so fresh and light.</li>
