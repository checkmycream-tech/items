            <li>I love that it leaves it feeling hydrated but doesn&#x27;t leave a slippery/wet feeling.  </li>

            <li>What I didn&#x27;t expect is that after a month of use my skin improved even more.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>

            <li>The lotion has a pleasant sense that lingers away fast.</li>
            <li>THIS IS THE BEST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER FOUND FOR DRY SKIN AND THE PRICE</li>
            <li>like it because it feels light and my skin looks and feels better.  </li>
            <li>Smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;To understand why I am so impressed with Natural Vibrancy as a rejuvenating body lotion, I must first tell you</li>
            <li>The lotion is light , absorbs quickly, non-greassy which is a plus and leaves my skin nice and smooth and hydrated as well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like creams or lotions with  a strong sense.</li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly  leaving my skin silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I experienced certain complications that resulted in me losing certain mobility functions.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference since I stated using it just over a week ago.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, smooth and not greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to have found this product and will get rid of my medical lotions and petroleum jelly in favor of this lotion.</li>
            <li>Feels nice on skin and body , not sticky at all and skin absorbes it really</li>
            <li>That is the feeling that the skin gets -  fantastic sense of hydration, calmness, smoothness and contentment.</li>
            <li>At lease so far so good.</li>
            <li>I just applied this product to my hands and so far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>It has a gentle smell, which is nice and sweet.</li>
            <li>You can tell this is a nice high quality lotion.</li>
            <li>Thus, over the years, both my lower legs and my hands--because they are always moving -- have had the skin \\&quot;damaged\\&quot; to a significant degree by both the water, and the chemicals in it.</li>
            <li>The lotion is light and absorb quickly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ingredients are clean too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Things to watch: It has a very pleasant but initially noticeable smell, which comes from natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Natural Vibrancy can save money because of the greater volume, and I can smile more by using it with</li>
            <li>I am a caregiver and I am always looking for a good lotion since I have to wash my hands constantly.</li>
            <li>one more thing - the team that created the lotion was very helpful.</li>
            <li>Super moisturizing lotion.</li>
            <li>The scent is mild though but it does linger on your skin for a while.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into your skin quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling at all.</li>
            <li>This lotion to my surprise was not at all greasy and spread quickly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended !!!</li>
            <li>I can get a little or a lot out with great</li>
            <li>When I first put it on, I noticed it had a clean and fresh scent</li>
            <li>Natural Vibrancy is the expert, and so I&#x27;d love to learn WHY they made the choices they made with the non-obvious ingredients.</li>
            <li>Well absorbed into skin with no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>This lotion makes my hands feel soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent though.</li>
            <li>Got it from amazon.com, paid VAT and delivery costs and hoped it was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was worth it.</li>
            <li>This is a fair product that does not really help severely dry skin, but it is nice to have in the guest bathroom for when people are done washing their hands.</li>
            <li>It feels so nice and hydrating that I compare it to a feeling of drinking water after a long hike.</li>
            <li>A larger, more economical size.  </li>
            <li>Soaks into the skin super fast.</li>
            <li>It took a few seconds more to absorb into my skin, leaving it feeling refreshed, rejuvenated, with a light clean smell and no grease at</li>
            <li>first concern, as a guy, was the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love what it has done for my face especially.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This is my first time review product.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I can see that my wrinkles have started to smooth out considerably.</li>
            <li>Smooths and hydrates my skin beautifully and helps tone and firm up my 90 year old father&#x27;s skin so well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While almost everything is good, I have a few question marks.  </li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s soft and silky on your skin and absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>Not only did I feel fresh, smooth and healthy, but I looked years younger.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been looking for an a lotion with no alcohol since this ingredient tends to dry out my hands more than it moisturizes them.</li>
            <li>I have used it on my face, but it was even better for winter-ized dry skin.</li>
            <li>and I do not know why certain ingredients are in the lotion</li>
            <li>my very dry hands skin better</li>
            <li>I was amazed at its luxurious feeling and gentle fragrance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a flight attendant with dehydrated skin all the time.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t like that too much.</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t like the smell to much either.</li>
            <li>but im still undecided if I really like it or not.</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li>It smells so fresh and makes your skin feel young.</li>
            <li>There is something about the smell and texture of it that makes you feel very</li>
            <li>(because pricey, so I don&#x27;t want to use it on my whole body).</li>
            <li>Very therapeutic.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the manufacturer is still trying to figure out where to source the ingredients, but a larger size would be much more economical to me in the future.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;After 3 weeks of use, this product seems to work very well.</li>
            <li>larger sizes available</li>
            <li>It works really well.  </li>
            <li>It softens skin very well.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to apply it very often.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel very silky and</li>
            <li>I am super picky about my moisturizers and insist on high quality with natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent body lotion; however, it&#x27;s very overpriced.  </li>
            <li>when I finally got it the top of it was kind of loose and a little bit was leaking out..</li>
            <li>Lotion works well but don&#x27;t particularly care for the scent.</li>
            <li>And even though the exercises have helped me tremendously with my mobility, being in the water for this extended period of time has caused me a number of skin related issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Recommended highly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>daughter (with dry eczema skin) has a nice and even complexion, humid and fresh, after just a few applications.</li>
            <li>Natural Vibrancy&#x27;s Pure Body Lotion may have ended that search.  </li>
            <li>I like it and like to smell it on my clothes, but if you are very smell sensitive or highly allergic, have a test first.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seriously the best lotion hands down, I&#x27;m 30 yrs old</li>
            <li>As yesterday was an unusually hot, dry day, I eagerly tried on Natural Vibrancy for the very first time.</li>
            <li>and I feel like the lotion keeps the skin hydrated pretty much the entire day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like the cheap ones I&#x27;ve used with other lotions.  </li>
            <li>The product is very good, not perfect but close enough.</li>
            <li>This has become our new \\&quot;go to\\&quot; lotion.</li>
            <li>I realize this may be a brand new product to the market and</li>
            <li>I have tried other lotions and creams in the past; but never have I experienced with them the immediate results I have with using Natural</li>
            <li>pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>I bought this lotion for my husband whose hands are covered with small cracks (and have been for many years)</li>
            <li>it truly moisturizes, refreshes and nourishes my skin like no other lotion!!!</li>
            <li>I bought this product since it is made with natural products and to support a member of Lithuanian community.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But anyway I fixed it an used some on my hands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a high-quality natural lotion for some time.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing either girly or masculine about it.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is non-greasy and leaves my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li>But I want something &amp;#34;non-medical&amp;#34; and not heavy.</li>
            <li>and it actually hydrates my skin for the whole day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;All natural ingredients&lt;br</li>
            <li>like all natural</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft and silky without an oily feel.</li>
            <li>So far, so old.</li>
            <li>I like that this lotion is for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin really soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I would give this product one extra star for fast shipping and delivery if I could!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a capricious and sensitive skin that reacts to lot of chemicals that are routinely added to cosmetics.</li>
            <li>It is natural.</li>
            <li>and I suffer from pre mature aging</li>
            <li>I went shopping on Amazon recently, deliberately searching for a lotion to help remedy particular skin issues I experience.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, after only 2 generous applications of the Natural Vibrancy Skin Care lotion, the moisturizing effect is already noticeable!!  </li>
            <li>I expected some immediant smoothness but didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>Works great for my dry skin but way too expensive!</li>
            <li>In particular, the back of my hands have developed deep wrinkles; and the skin is rough to the touch.</li>
            <li>I like it to moisturize my sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li>I use it on my legs, arms and my face and while the bottle isn&#x27;t very large, a little does go a long way for me.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs very well and you only need a little.</li>

            <li> Natural Vibrancy is the expert, and so I&#x27;d love to learn WHY they made the choices they made with the non-obvious ingredients.</li>
            <li> Well absorbed into skin with no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> This lotion makes my hands feel soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent though.</li>
            <li> Got it from amazon.com, paid VAT and delivery costs and hoped it was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a fair product that does not really help severely dry skin, but it is nice to have in the guest bathroom for when people are done washing their hands.</li>
            <li> It feels so nice and hydrating that I compare it to a feeling of drinking water after a long hike.</li>
            <li> A larger, more economical size.  </li>
            <li> Soaks into the skin super fast.</li>
            <li> It took a few seconds more to absorb into my skin, leaving it feeling refreshed, rejuvenated, with a light clean smell and no grease at</li>
            <li> first concern, as a guy, was the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love what it has done for my face especially.  </li>
            <li> Does exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is my first time review product.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I can see that my wrinkles have started to smooth out considerably.</li>
            <li> Smooths and hydrates my skin beautifully and helps tone and firm up my 90 year old father&#x27;s skin so well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While almost everything is good, I have a few question marks.  </li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s soft and silky on your skin and absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li> Not only did I feel fresh, smooth and healthy, but I looked years younger.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been looking for an a lotion with no alcohol since this ingredient tends to dry out my hands more than it moisturizes them.</li>
            <li> I have used it on my face, but it was even better for winter-ized dry skin.</li>
            <li> and I do not know why certain ingredients are in the lotion</li>
            <li> my very dry hands skin better</li>
            <li> I was amazed at its luxurious feeling and gentle fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a flight attendant with dehydrated skin all the time.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like that too much.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t like the smell to much either.</li>
            <li> but im still undecided if I really like it or not.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li> It smells so fresh and makes your skin feel young.</li>
            <li> There is something about the smell and texture of it that makes you feel very</li>
            <li> (because pricey, so I don&#x27;t want to use it on my whole body).</li>
            <li> Very therapeutic.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the manufacturer is still trying to figure out where to source the ingredients, but a larger size would be much more economical to me in the future.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;After 3 weeks of use, this product seems to work very well.</li>
            <li> larger sizes available</li>
            <li> It works really well.  </li>
            <li> It softens skin very well.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to apply it very often.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel very silky and</li>
            <li> I am super picky about my moisturizers and insist on high quality with natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent body lotion; however, it&#x27;s very overpriced.  </li>
            <li> when I finally got it the top of it was kind of loose and a little bit was leaking out..</li>
            <li> Lotion works well but don&#x27;t particularly care for the scent.</li>
            <li> And even though the exercises have helped me tremendously with my mobility, being in the water for this extended period of time has caused me a number of skin related issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Recommended highly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> daughter (with dry eczema skin) has a nice and even complexion, humid and fresh, after just a few applications.</li>
            <li> Natural Vibrancy&#x27;s Pure Body Lotion may have ended that search.  </li>
            <li> I like it and like to smell it on my clothes, but if you are very smell sensitive or highly allergic, have a test first.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seriously the best lotion hands down, I&#x27;m 30 yrs old</li>
            <li> As yesterday was an unusually hot, dry day, I eagerly tried on Natural Vibrancy for the very first time.</li>
            <li> and I feel like the lotion keeps the skin hydrated pretty much the entire day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like the cheap ones I&#x27;ve used with other lotions.  </li>
            <li> The product is very good, not perfect but close enough.</li>
            <li> This has become our new \\&quot;go to\\&quot; lotion.</li>
            <li> I realize this may be a brand new product to the market and</li>
            <li> I have tried other lotions and creams in the past; but never have I experienced with them the immediate results I have with using Natural</li>
            <li> pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion for my husband whose hands are covered with small cracks (and have been for many years)</li>
            <li> it truly moisturizes, refreshes and nourishes my skin like no other lotion!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product since it is made with natural products and to support a member of Lithuanian community.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But anyway I fixed it an used some on my hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a high-quality natural lotion for some time.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing either girly or masculine about it.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is non-greasy and leaves my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li> But I want something &amp;#34;non-medical&amp;#34; and not heavy.</li>
            <li> and it actually hydrates my skin for the whole day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;All natural ingredients&lt;br</li>
            <li> like all natural</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft and silky without an oily feel.</li>
            <li> So far, so old.</li>
            <li> I like that this lotion is for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin really soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I would give this product one extra star for fast shipping and delivery if I could!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a capricious and sensitive skin that reacts to lot of chemicals that are routinely added to cosmetics.</li>
            <li> It is natural.</li>
            <li> and I suffer from pre mature aging</li>
            <li> I went shopping on Amazon recently, deliberately searching for a lotion to help remedy particular skin issues I experience.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, after only 2 generous applications of the Natural Vibrancy Skin Care lotion, the moisturizing effect is already noticeable!!  </li>
            <li> I expected some immediant smoothness but didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> Works great for my dry skin but way too expensive!</li>
            <li> In particular, the back of my hands have developed deep wrinkles; and the skin is rough to the touch.</li>
            <li> I like it to moisturize my sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li> I use it on my legs, arms and my face and while the bottle isn&#x27;t very large, a little does go a long way for me.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs very well and you only need a little.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little strong for my liking since I usually don&#x27;t go for scented lotions.</li>
            <li> Good for my tired dried legs!!</li>
            <li> other thing I like is that I&#x27;m not a big fan of scented lotion since I have sensitive skin and was concerned about it.</li>
            <li> Does not last long.  </li>
            <li> I live in the UK and this lotion is not widely available, but I thought I would give it a go.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just subtle, consistent, goodness.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, I can hardly wait to see the \\&quot;whole body\\</li>
            <li> I will keep buying this stuff as long as they keep making it.</li>
            <li> I wear long pants in summer to hide my legs with flaky crack skin.</li>
            <li> &quot; results whichwill come about after my long term, continuous use of the lotion.</li>
            <li> Instead of vasaline and other similar products, I need to put petrolum jelly as my lotion just to give you an idea.</li>
            <li> hydrates without ever making my face look or feel greasy and the flakey dry patches are gone.  </li>
            <li> I have unusually dry skin that requires prescription cream from my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I have chronic dry skin</li>
            <li> I use this lotion and don&#x27;t feel my hand cracking dry.</li>
            <li> Old lady smell get past</li>
            <li> I usually apply a antioxidant serum before my moisturizers but when using  Natural Vibrancy</li>
            <li> My hands were very dry from moping the floor 5 years ago without wearing gloves.</li>
            <li> I happened to stumble upon natural vibrancy on YouTube and decided to try it, seriously the minute I rubbed it on my face</li>
            <li> Interesting scent...not bad...</li>
            <li> So there&#x27;s not much.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I seen other reviews on this lotion I was exstatic to order it.</li>
            <li> I apply maybe twice as much as other lotions because it keeps soaking in.  </li>
            <li> of course that stains all my clothes and it&#x27;s no fun in the summer time when I&#x27;m already sticky from the heat.</li>
            <li> I do, however, have a slight sense of it on my skin.  </li>
            <li> less fiscal concern.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Irritatingly, as a side note, I screwed it closed for an airline flight, and it somehow opened and made a big mess in the luggage.</li>
            <li> Compared to the 17 or 30 ounce size for other lotions, this is surprisingly small for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you cannot picture that, imagine a tradition coke can with 1/3 missing.  </li>
            <li> (Babassu Palm) Kernel Oil, Hydroxyproply Starch Phosphate, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Alge Extract, Astrocaryum Murumuru (Palm) seed butter, Camelia Sinesis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Butyrosperum  Parkil (Shea),</li>
            <li> the review of the person who needed to be in the pool everyday caught my attention</li>
            <li> Within a few days, my skin stops flaking and the cracks lighten.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to use it for a few weeks and go shopping for shorts and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the worst kind of beauty product customer, lazy but want results.</li>
            <li> I am also too lazy to reapply lotion every 4 hours or even twice a day.</li>
            <li> twisted the pump lid open and and squeezed a dime sized drop into my hand.</li>
            <li> I always use lotion in small amounts because the greasy oily feeling is unbearable to me.</li>
            <li> All of my body, except my neck and head, is submerged in water: usually for 1 hour each session, 3-4 times per week.  </li>
            <li> , my skin is so bad that any moisturizer I use, even heavy butters within 2 min after rubbing it on, my skin would just revert  back to being ashy, dull and dry,</li>
            <li> Also it does not have an artificial, harsh chemical odor.</li>
            <li> not great.</li>
            <li> Sooths and protects against cold weather skin dryness.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This lotion works great for my skin!  I love that it leaves it feeling hydrated but doesn&#x27;t leave a slippery/wet feeling.  It rubs in well and has a great scent to it!</li>
            <li> I have been using the lotion for the last two weeks. It&#x27;s a wonderful product. I don&#x27;t like creams or lotions with  a strong sense. The lotion has a pleasant sense that lingers away fast. It absorbs quickly, smooth and not greasy. I definitely would recommend this lotion to anyone.</li>
            <li> As yesterday was an unusually hot, dry day, I eagerly tried on Natural Vibrancy for the very first time. I was amazed at its luxurious feeling and gentle fragrance. My highly sensitive skin immediately responded with a brilliant glow that lasted for hours. Not only did I feel fresh, smooth and healthy, but I looked years younger. This is the closest to perfection I have ever seen or felt in a body or facial lotion.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this hydrating nutrient rich lotion!!!!  I am super picky about my moisturizers and insist on high quality with natural ingredients.  When I first put it on, I noticed it had a clean and fresh scent and it immediately soaked into my skin leaving a beautiful glow.  Best of all, my skin continued to feel AMAZING...the rest of the day!! The antioxidants and minerals make me feel like I am feeding my skin a healthy diet!!  I can&#x27;t say enough about this well priced moisturizer...it truly moisturizes, refreshes and nourishes my skin like no other lotion!!!</li>
            <li> Works great for my dry skin but way too expensive!</li>
            <li> I bought this product since it is made with natural products and to support a member of Lithuanian community.&lt;br /&gt;I like it because it feels light and my skin looks and feels better.  Also it does not have an artificial, harsh chemical odor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a flight attendant with dehydrated skin all the time. This lotion is amazing, I love it!!! The lotion is light , absorbs quickly, non-greassy which is a plus and leaves my skin nice and smooth and hydrated as well. I will definitely use this product again and recommend it  to all the flight attendants i know. Will be looking forward for some travel sizes as well and what it&#x27;s next to come.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent body lotion; however, it&#x27;s very overpriced.  Does not last long.  Cheaper lotions are comparable.</li>
            <li> I seen other reviews on this lotion I was exstatic to order it. when I finally got it the top of it was kind of loose and a little bit was leaking out..didn&#x27;t like that too much. But anyway I fixed it an used some on my hands. I expected some immediant smoothness but didn&#x27;t do much. I also didn&#x27;t like the smell to much either. but it didn&#x27;t give me a allergic reaction anywhere on my skin so I decided to keep it anyway. I might purchase another..but im still undecided if I really like it or not.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion. It smells so fresh and makes your skin feel young. There is something about the smell and texture of it that makes you feel very feminine.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter (with dry eczema skin) has a nice and even complexion, humid and fresh, after just a few applications.</li>
            <li> I like it to moisturize my sensitive and dry skin. I am using it on my face (because pricey, so I don&#x27;t want to use it on my whole body). The smell is good and feels good. I will continue to try it to see how it could change my skin after 30 days.  At lease so far so good.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!  Smooths and hydrates my skin beautifully and helps tone and firm up my 90 year old father&#x27;s skin so well.  I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference since I stated using it just over a week ago.  Will definately order again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a high-quality natural lotion for some time.  Natural Vibrancy&#x27;s Pure Body Lotion may have ended that search.  I&#x27;m going to describe various aspects of the product, but allow me to start with the bottom line: this is among the finest lotions I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FRAGRANCE:&lt;br /&gt;My first concern, as a guy, was the fragrance.  There are a lot of \\&quot;girly\\&quot; lotions out there, and indeed, a fellow Amazon reviewer mentioned that this product&#x27;s fragrance made her feel feminine.  The description \\&quot;For Women &amp; Men\\&quot; consoled me, however, and the final decider was the money-back guarantee.  I bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fragrance.  There&#x27;s nothing either girly or masculine about it.  It&#x27;s just subtle, consistent, goodness.  My wife likes it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SIZE:&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is 8 ounces.  If you cannot picture that, imagine a tradition coke can with 1/3 missing.  That&#x27;s 8 ounces.  So there&#x27;s not much.  Compared to the 17 or 30 ounce size for other lotions, this is surprisingly small for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EXPERIENCE:&lt;br /&gt;My skin loves this stuff.  I apply maybe twice as much as other lotions because it keeps soaking in.  That impresses me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not greasy.  It&#x27;s not gross.  I do, however, have a slight sense of it on my skin.  It&#x27;s like an impossibly-thin glove, but doesn&#x27;t bother me in the slightest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle includes a great pump.  It&#x27;s not like the cheap ones I&#x27;ve used with other lotions.  I can get a little or a lot out with great consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS:&lt;br /&gt;Water, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Glycerin, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Cerearyl Olivate, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Sorbitan Olivate, Sodium Acrylates Coploymer, Orbignya Speciosa (Babassu Palm) Kernel Oil, Hydroxyproply Starch Phosphate, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Alge Extract, Astrocaryum Murumuru (Palm) seed butter, Camelia Sinesis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Butyrosperum  Parkil (Shea), Saccharide Isomerate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Hyaluronic Acid, Phenoxyethanol Ethylhexylglycerin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT I&#x27;D LIKE TO SEE IN THE FUTURE:&lt;br /&gt;* A larger, more economical size.  Natural Vibrancy can save money because of the greater volume, and I can smile more by using it with less fiscal concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* An explanation of the ingredient list.  I&#x27;ve looked up every item here (I know...ANAL!).  I don&#x27;t eat chemical junk, and similarly, I don&#x27;t want chemical junk on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While almost everything is good, I have a few question marks.  Natural Vibrancy is the expert, and so I&#x27;d love to learn WHY they made the choices they made with the non-obvious ingredients.</li>
            <li> My wife and I use it on a regular basis. It really is amazing on my skin. I like the way it feels on my face and so I use it now as my face cream. What I didn&#x27;t expect is that after a month of use my skin improved even more.</li>
            <li> This lotion is non-greasy and leaves my skin so soft.  I use it on my legs, arms and my face and while the bottle isn&#x27;t very large, a little does go a long way for me.  I absolutely love what it has done for my face especially.  I have acne and this lotion hydrates without ever making my face look or feel greasy and the flakey dry patches are gone.  I will keep buying this stuff as long as they keep making it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the worst kind of beauty product customer, lazy but want results. I have unusually dry skin that requires prescription cream from my dermatologist. But I want something &amp;#34;non-medical&amp;#34; and not heavy. I am also too lazy to reapply lotion every 4 hours or even twice a day. I wear long pants in summer to hide my legs with flaky crack skin. Instead of vasaline and other similar products, I need to put petrolum jelly as my lotion just to give you an idea. of course that stains all my clothes and it&#x27;s no fun in the summer time when I&#x27;m already sticky from the heat. I heard about the hydrating property of seaweed and came searching for lotion with seaweed at Amazon. I have never heard of this brand but the review of the person who needed to be in the pool everyday caught my attention so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised! The lotion is light and absorb quickly and I only put it on once and it actually hydrates my skin for the whole day. Within a few days, my skin stops flaking and the cracks lighten. I&#x27;m going to use it for a few weeks and go shopping for shorts and skirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing I like is that I&#x27;m not a big fan of scented lotion since I have sensitive skin and was concerned about it. I would say the scent is very light if there is any, I can&#x27;t smell it at all. I&#x27;m happy to have found this product and will get rid of my medical lotions and petroleum jelly in favor of this lotion.</li>
            <li> Feels nice on skin and body , not sticky at all and skin absorbes it really fast.made my very dry hands skin better and I liked it when used before make up .</li>
            <li> Wonderful product !  I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> Does exactly as advertised. The product is very good, not perfect but close enough. Count me in as a repeat buyer.</li>
            <li> The lotion is amazing! Very therapeutic.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like liquid gold on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again and again</li>
            <li> The best body lotion I have ever used. Well absorbed into skin with no greasy feeling. Skin feels soft and smooth. Sooths and protects against cold weather skin dryness. No perfumed or medicinal odors so my husband and I both use it. This has become our new \\&quot;go to\\&quot; lotion. I&#x27;ve already purchased three. Never want to run out. It&#x27;s that good!</li>
            <li> I have chronic dry skin and I&#x27;ve been looking for an a lotion with no alcohol since this ingredient tends to dry out my hands more than it moisturizes them. I just applied this product to my hands and so far so good. We&#x27;ll see how it works in the coming weeks. One critique is that I would suggest is selling a larger size at the same price. I realize this may be a brand new product to the market and the manufacturer is still trying to figure out where to source the ingredients, but a larger size would be much more economical to me in the future. If the company did that, I think I might be a customer for life. I&#x27;m giving this product four stars because I am not done with the testing of the product yet.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;After 3 weeks of use, this product seems to work very well. Again, I wish they had a larger size. I would buy it in an instant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;All natural ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Alcohol Free&lt;br /&gt;Subtle fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;Expensive for the size&lt;br /&gt;No larger sizes available</li>
            <li> This is my first time review product.  The lotion is very good.  My hands were very dry from moping the floor 5 years ago without wearing gloves. I use this lotion and don&#x27;t feel my hand cracking dry. I also use this lotion on my body since I swim 3 times a week 2 hours each time to hydrate my skin.  So far so good. Great job</li>
            <li> Not my favorite scent, but works well for hydration!</li>
            <li> This pure body lotion is very good.  It works really well.  It has a gentle smell, which is nice and sweet. It&#x27;s ingredients are clean too.</li>
            <li> I love it. It makes my skin so smooth and soft. The smell is a little strong for my liking since I usually don&#x27;t go for scented lotions.</li>
            <li> Good for my tired dried legs!!, It&#x27;s soft and silky on your skin and absorbed quickly. Highly recommended !!!</li>
            <li> Old lady smell get past that it works pretty good.  like all natural</li>
            <li> Super moisturizing lotion. Soaks into the skin super fast.</li>
            <li> nice lotion and leaves moisturized</li>
            <li> Very nice lotion; nice consistency, nice smell. Leaves my skin soft and silky without an oily feel. Very happy!</li>
            <li> I am a caregiver and I am always looking for a good lotion since I have to wash my hands constantly. This lotion makes my hands feel soft and smooth! I am very pleased with it. I will continue to use it and I would definitely recommend it to others!</li>
            <li> Interesting scent...not bad...not great. Just a different scent that I have to get used to. But it definitely gets the job done. Smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion for my husband whose hands are covered with small cracks (and have been for many years) so he can&#x27;t use lotions with alcohol. So far, so old. He has used it for the last week and is getting results with no pain. Also am getting email ollowups from the producers.  Will order again</li>
            <li> This is a fair product that does not really help severely dry skin, but it is nice to have in the guest bathroom for when people are done washing their hands.</li>
            <li> I like that this lotion is for sensitive skin. It makes my skin really soft and hydrated. I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent though. Rosewater scent maybe? But I go more for fruit scents anyway. The scent is mild though but it does linger on your skin for a while. It absorbs into your skin quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling at all. It softens skin very well. Good product!</li>
            <li> Believe me I have tried alot of lotions! For the price and quality and quantity, this is the one I plan to stick with for years to come.  Very nice lotion for face and body with a light scent.  Recommended highly.</li>
            <li> For the price, this is nice, smooth, and absorbent. I have used it on my face, but it was even better for winter-ized dry skin. Irritatingly, as a side note, I screwed it closed for an airline flight, and it somehow opened and made a big mess in the luggage.</li>
            <li> Lotion works well but don&#x27;t particularly care for the scent.</li>
            <li> I was so exited to see my package arrive in just 2 days! I would give this product one extra star for fast shipping and delivery if I could!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I twisted the pump lid open and and squeezed a dime sized drop into my hand. I always use lotion in small amounts because the greasy oily feeling is unbearable to me. This lotion to my surprise was not at all greasy and spread quickly. It took a few seconds more to absorb into my skin, leaving it feeling refreshed, rejuvenated, with a light clean smell and no grease at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to leave this on my desk at work daily since I push papers for a living. I need something that can moisturize my hands without leaving grease spots on my keyboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A definite must purchase to leave on your desk at work, and another bottle for home use!!</li>
            <li> This is truly one of the best lotions I&#x27;ve tried. It absorbs very quickly  leaving my skin silky and smooth. It feels so nice and hydrating that I compare it to a feeling of drinking water after a long hike. That is the feeling that the skin gets -  fantastic sense of hydration, calmness, smoothness and contentment. The feeling also last quite a while, no need to reapply often. At work I have to wash my hands a  lot and I feel like the lotion keeps the skin hydrated pretty much the entire day. Great product, highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> I have a capricious and sensitive skin that reacts to lot of chemicals that are routinely added to cosmetics. I live in the UK and this lotion is not widely available, but I thought I would give it a go. Got it from amazon.com, paid VAT and delivery costs and hoped it was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was worth it. Things I like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It is natural. No nasty chemicals and upset my skin.&lt;br /&gt;- It is not greasy. It absorbs very well and you only need a little. The bottle will last a while.&lt;br /&gt;- You don&#x27;t need to apply it very often. Once your dryness settles, you will probably need occasional applications.&lt;br /&gt;- It makes my skin feel very silky and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to watch: It has a very pleasant but initially noticeable smell, which comes from natural ingredients. I like it and like to smell it on my clothes, but if you are very smell sensitive or highly allergic, have a test first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And one more thing - the team that created the lotion was very helpful. A big thank you to them.</li>
            <li> Feels nice, smell is a bit strong.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and will recommend it for everybody.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER FOUND FOR DRY SKIN AND THE PRICE IF WORHT IT</li>
            <li> You can tell this is a nice high quality lotion. It feels very nice on the skin and isnt oily at all. A little goes a long way. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Seriously the best lotion hands down, I&#x27;m 30 yrs old and I suffer from pre mature aging, my skin is so bad that any moisturizer I use, even heavy butters within 2 min after rubbing it on, my skin would just revert  back to being ashy, dull and dry, smh.  I happened to stumble upon natural vibrancy on YouTube and decided to try it, seriously the minute I rubbed it on my face my skin said Thank You Girl! I instantly felt the dryness and the tightness vanish, My skin glowed, my skin never glow! I usually apply a antioxidant serum before my moisturizers but when using  Natural Vibrancy it&#x27;s not even necessary. I thank god for helping me to find this lotion....</li>
            <li> I went shopping on Amazon recently, deliberately searching for a lotion to help remedy particular skin issues I experience.  I have tried other lotions and creams in the past; but never have I experienced with them the immediate results I have with using Natural Vibrancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To understand why I am so impressed with Natural Vibrancy as a rejuvenating body lotion, I must first tell you I had a total left hip replacement in 2005.  Unfortunately, I experienced certain complications that resulted in me losing certain mobility functions.  However, a physio-therapist introduced me to water walking - and related water exercises-- in 2006.  The exercises I perform are all done in the deep end of my local YMCA pool.  All of my body, except my neck and head, is submerged in water: usually for 1 hour each session, 3-4 times per week.  And even though the exercises have helped me tremendously with my mobility, being in the water for this extended period of time has caused me a number of skin related issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you know, chemicals are added to public pools as a safety precaution.  And the amount of chemical added can vary according to the number of people using the pool. Thus, over the years, both my lower legs and my hands--because they are always moving -- have had the skin \\&quot;damaged\\&quot; to a significant degree by both the water, and the chemicals in it. In particular, the back of my hands have developed deep wrinkles; and the skin is rough to the touch. Too, they are itchy because they are so dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after only 2 generous applications of the Natural Vibrancy Skin Care lotion, the moisturizing effect is already noticeable!!  Even though I am not a scientist and I do not know why certain ingredients are in the lotion, I do know they are working.  I can see that my wrinkles have started to smooth out considerably. The skin no longer feels as parched. And the itch has totally gone!! Therefore, I can hardly wait to see the \\&quot;whole body\\&quot; results whichwill come about after my long term, continuous use of the lotion.</li>
