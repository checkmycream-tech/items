            <li>I have tried many peel pads and these I find to be the best.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t stop touching my face!!! :-)</li>
            <li>My skin feels great and seems to look more radiant already!</li>
            <li>Used with the PTR Un-Wrinkle night cream and you will see a  wonderful change in the texture and fine lines on your face.</li>
            <li>I read excellent reviews about this product on Sephora.com but bought it on Amazon because it&#x27;s cheaper with free shipping here (for a prime user).</li>
            <li>My hands look so good</li>
            <li>I would say these are a good introduction into chemical peels.</li>
            <li>I also found this to be the best price available, both online and in stores.  </li>
            <li>Good product that does what it says.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for a good hand cream SPF 30 with moisturizers &amp; does not wash off.</li>
            <li>I felt the price was fair for the results I did see,  and the number of pads I got.</li>
            <li>Skin tingles a bit in a good way and glows for hours afterwards.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This may be a good \\&quot;starter\\&quot; peel</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good</li>
            <li>Try his unwrinkled cream you would be amazed I am being very truthful</li>

            <li>Great product and in easy transaction will buy again from seller.</li>
            <li>It works great on my fine lines ...</li>
            <li>Its an amazing product.</li>
            <li>Gotta say I really liked it too.</li>
            <li>Make sure you wash your face really good before so the ingredients can do its work.</li>
            <li>Smooths my skin and gives me a nice glow.</li>
            <li>I  will need to review in a month or so to know if it is truly effective.</li>
            <li>Got a sample kit off another cosmetic site, and liked it.</li>
            <li>So, hopefully this product will prove to be effective for the price.</li>
            <li>but this seems a bit more diverse and is doing a good job on blemishes and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I think no matter what kind of skin you have</li>
            <li>but the results are quick and beautiful.</li>
            <li>These pads really do a good job of removing flakiness, and making my skin look clean and bright.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love these - they do sting a bit and don&#x27;t have the most pleasant odor</li>
            <li>It is fine and works good, just do not use to often.</li>
            <li>My skin tone and texture have greatly improved and I&#x27;m not even through my first jar yet!  </li>
            <li>My skin looks bright, smooth and renewed.</li>
            <li>Does not irritate my skin and leave it feeling smooth, bright and refreshed.</li>
            <li>yes you have to use it ...way better than any kind of surgery def</li>
            <li>Love these pads...easy, quick and effective!</li>
            <li>My skin looks amazing, so clear and bright!  </li>
            <li>They help with fine lines, minimize pores &amp; exfoliate!</li>
            <li>These are good if your looking to freshen up your complexion quickly</li>
            <li>Easy to use and effective.  </li>
            <li>But i love it</li>
            <li>&amp; I love them.</li>
            <li>what I could thought of is that the seller opened it just a bit ,pour some liquid or most probably water in it</li>
            <li>I will see how it looks in 3 more months and update this review.  </li>
            <li>Ok, I didn&#x27;t purchase this for my hands, but followed the recommendation on the jar to apply to top  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>I use it about three times a week and my skin does look much better.</li>
            <li>, rinse off, apply your favorite serum and moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Many compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried and it is just ok</li>
            <li>Thought my skin would look &amp; feel better.</li>
            <li>I make sure they are sealed every time I use them</li>
            <li>I am 27 and just love it.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to use Peter Thomas Roth any more for the reason.</li>
            <li>I would gladly trade shelf life in for a safe product....</li>
            <li>Sure we might not notice immediate effects...but using all these chemicals over time...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this product more than once on amazon and love it.</li>
            <li>Again love his products they do work.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin so smooth, even toned, and luminescent!</li>
            <li>My skin looks fantastic for my age, if I do say so myself!</li>
            <li>all my skin looks and feels better.  </li>
            <li>My skin, however, is definitely soft, smooth, and feels great!</li>
            <li>It does leave my face feeling tighter(firmer?) and more radiant.  </li>
            <li>It also helps for better absorption of my skin creams.</li>
            <li>I’m glad my impulse buy has now produced</li>
            <li>Now I’m in more of a maintenance mode.</li>
            <li>It seems that my moisturizer soaks in better into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Will buy again, great packaging and fast ship.</li>
            <li>I was given a sample of 7 &amp; felt satisfied after the week.</li>
            <li>Outstanding product and service.</li>
            <li>When I was given a sample of the Peter Roth c30 citrus, I fell in love.</li>
            <li>I love these peel pads.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed more acne on my skin, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like shiny healthy look after using.</li>
            <li>, she uses PCA which I love .  </li>
            <li>Your skin feels amazing, baby smooth.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>love this stuff</li>
            <li>My skin my more even</li>
            <li>and it looks more supple.  </li>
            <li>Makes my face soft, clean and bright!!</li>
            <li>but they make my skin feel so amazing and clean.</li>
            <li>These are pretty good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and it&#x27;s better than scrubs.</li>
            <li>Great Product &amp; will for sure be buying more in future!</li>
            <li>I bought these and liked them right off the bat.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t tell you how effective they are as undoing wrinkles, but am very optimistic these will stay a keeper in my facial cleansing routine because they just feel so good on the skin, unbelievably good</li>
            <li>I use it every other night and it works great!</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good about it!</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, works well.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Start with clean skin, apply product on the peel pads onto your face and let it sit on your skin 2-5 minutes then rinse off and apply your favorite serum(mine</li>
            <li>But I emailed amazon and they were able to mail me another one right away.&lt;br /&gt;OK, now about the product!</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t have the same allergic reactions on my cheek area which looked beautifully glowing after just a couple of applications.</li>
            <li>This product arrived in good condition with a unbroken seal brand new jar.</li>
            <li>Fine.</li>
            <li>Seems to take out the fine lines and the blackheads.</li>
            <li>Not as an exfoliator, but almost more like a peel you wipe on and quickly rinse from your face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now, but I have to say I was amazed and satisfied after the first use!</li>
            <li>Then two at the bottom of my chin that were huge and hurt, which never happens.</li>
            <li>Iâ€™m a huge fan.</li>
            <li>I received a real PTR product (determined when comparing with one at Sephora) and it seems to be effective.</li>
            <li>When I rinse off my face it feel so smooth.</li>
            <li>I have had great results and this was my second purchase of it.  </li>
            <li>It gives a fantastic glow.</li>
            <li>Plus you get free samples and still get free shipping because the product alone will qualify.</li>
            <li>That cost about $500 for a package of 3 ( get the strongest available)</li>
            <li>My makeup goes on so smooth and</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look smooth and radiant at 67.&lt;br /&gt;Sold</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see the continuing results as I use them more often - hopefully they help soften the smile lines around my eyes and the worry lines on my forehead.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making such a great product, PTR!</li>
            <li>good product, it can remove the head skin but not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Of natural ingredients and a good combination of peel&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients to cover a multitude of skin conditions.</li>
            <li>but I just love this and can see a difference right away.</li>
            <li>My breakouts were becoming more and more frequent and not even my ProActiv regimen was not working.  </li>
            <li>These are quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Great, light product that goes a long way!  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvements to fine lines yet (have some mild frown lines</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money to give it a shot if you are considering!</li>
            <li>First of all, I would like to say that I love this product</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t enjoy physical exfoliants but can tolerate chemical ones fairly well.</li>
            <li>My pores look smaller, skin is softer and dewy and my moisturizer is much more effective because it can get into my skin.  </li>
            <li>I thought that I could just keep them bedside and use them to clean my face when I wanted.</li>
            <li>I am a skin care junkie and PTR has really great products and these simply make any of their other products 10 times more effective.  </li>
            <li>Been using these for years and my skin is so smooth and wrinkle free thanks to this product!  </li>
            <li>I am not 100% sure that this is the real product.</li>
            <li>I tried it out a Sephora and loved it, but this feels different.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a true peel, even over time...</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll need more time to really tell if there&#x27;s a difference&lt;</li>
            <li>a good facial cleanser I didnt feel any tingle or saw any difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>Most other products only come with around 30 pads, so its a month supply at best if you just use once a day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other pads similar to these, and I think these have best ingredients, and perform better.</li>
            <li>They give you a nice little glow but doesn&#x27;t do anything that spectacular.  </li>
            <li>With consistent use my fine lines are gone.</li>
            <li>If you use it daily or even twice a day, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll see even better results than me.</li>
            <li>A mild exfoliant to use in between stronger peels.</li>
            <li>its mild on skin.</li>
            <li>The process takes less than five minutes to complete but the rewards are awesome – I receive many compliments about my clean and clear skin.</li>
            <li>I recommend using a good hydrating cream after each treatment to minimize dry patches.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with my purchase, you really CAN feel a difference after the first application.  </li>
            <li>They work really well on fine lines and pores</li>
            <li>this product is very good for cleaning the skin, especially if you do not have time to go for a facial</li>
            <li>I use it at night (gently rubbing in circular motion, then let sit for a couple minutes) and follow up with PTR \\&quot;Laser Free Regenerator\\&quot; moisturizing gel cream.</li>
            <li>Gets rid of all the dead skin and makes my skin feel great afterwards.</li>
            <li>They really help to exfoliate and smooth my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is sorta sensitive, acne prone, mostly oily.</li>
            <li>I love these so far.</li>
            <li>Not too harsh but a good light peel.</li>
            <li>Skin looks fresh</li>
            <li>Makes appearance fresh</li>
            <li>This product is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Again, rare.</li>
            <li>According to the ingredients listed here- most are natural.  </li>
            <li>It came sealed and completely fresh.</li>
            <li>Worth a try.</li>
            <li>It seems to leave the skin looking and feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>Using those once a week, I figured it was worth the money.</li>
            <li>As far as texture my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for Asian or other ethnic cystic acne prone skin</li>
            <li>these pads really work; i have fibromyalgia and don&#x27;t have much energy to do anything; these are easy to use and really can feel them working; they make my skin look more radiant and clear and smooth; will use them the rest of my life</li>
            <li>I like to use it right after I get out of the shower and leave it on for about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>I am placing a re-order right after typing this review.  </li>
            <li>After the first peel my skin felt smooth and much nicer.</li>
            <li>so this was very unexpected, especially after all the good reviews.</li>
            <li>Still waiting to see results on fine lines but skin feels soft and fresh after using.</li>
            <li>Also cut pads in half with good saturation.</li>
            <li>Right now I have one at the edge of my upper lip which is really sexy, let me tell you.</li>
            <li>My pores are cleaner and smaller and my fine lines are going away!  </li>
            <li>After the first use, my face was smooth, soft and gleaming!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve shopped, no outdated product, and no shipping!</li>
            <li>Those um \\&quot;age spots\\&quot;, so much lighter!</li>
            <li>After the first use, I noticed a glow to my skin and a smoothness.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the speedy shipping once again!</li>
            <li>Love these this is my second batch</li>
            <li>so my face was pretty well exfoliated, but I do see my skin brighter w/ these pad.</li>
            <li>and you have more than enough product for your face.  </li>
            <li>I have been sent many to reviews today and keep getting them back to review again.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say anything about the long term effects yet, but so far, so good.  </li>
            <li>Before using this I haven&#x27;t had any on my forehead in YEARS, and I got 2 within the first week.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these peel pads, just enough of a tingle to know they are working.  </li>
            <li>I have been using them for over a month and most definitely see a difference</li>
            <li>It does what it promisses, but you have to be consistent with using it.</li>
            <li>Broke out after first use</li>
            <li>As long as I don&#x27;t become red or break out, I&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li>Definitely saw smoother, softer, more youthful skin...but didn&#x27;t seem to help with sun and post acne marks.  </li>
            <li>Does anyone know a way to salvage these without requesting more and having the inconvenience of sending back?</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t burn but when I exhaled out of my nose, my breath felt hot.</li>
            <li>Made my foundation go on much smoother!</li>
            <li>and this is my first review.</li>
            <li>I use another pad after the first one dries.</li>
            <li>Amazon did a great job on responding to complaint.</li>
            <li>and i really noticed the difference!</li>
            <li>I have only used this product 3x, but so far I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I have used them every evening on clean skin for a month so far and cannot believe the results…</li>
            <li>My skin felt so soft and clean after using it one time.</li>
            <li>I only use this about 3-4 times a week but its safe for every day use because its so gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>Everyone needs this products makes your skin smooth , firm, love it</li>
            <li>IF, any is left, use on the top of the hands which accrue much damage from the sun.</li>
            <li>highly recommend these pads because they’re easy to use and not messy.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t noticed any positive difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I am positive</li>
            <li>My skin positively gleams after use and that always puts a twinkle in my eyes and a skip in my step.  </li>
            <li>after first week a real difference in smoothing wrinkles and texture of my face</li>
            <li>I happen to have combination skin that can pretty much take a beating.  </li>
            <li>I think if you are a bit younger it might work a lot better than it does for this older gal.</li>
            <li>First, I have very oily skin and large pores.</li>
            <li>These are great pads normally but the ones that arrived were dingy yellow, packaging corroded and smelled differently than the normal ones.</li>
            <li>I have not been using them long (about two weeks), so I can&#x27;t comment on the wrinkle reducing power, but they really do wonders for softening skin and making it more luminescent.  </li>
            <li>The first thing you&#x27;ll notice after you wash it off is your skin will feel really soft and fresh.</li>
            <li>no noticeable change in my large pores around nose and chin.</li>
            <li>I do not have large pores</li>
            <li>I CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT THESE!!</li>
            <li>in my early 30s and have early signs of fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>About a month after I started using this product I noticed a huge differents in my skin especially in my t-zone area.</li>
            <li>I have VERY oily skin.  </li>
            <li>Really like htis product.  </li>
            <li>Even my boyfriend noticed and asked me what happened to my skin because it looked much smoother and healthier.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see much happen.</li>
            <li>so much so, I was compelled to write this review.  </li>
            <li>You know every once in a while I buy something that works really well.</li>
            <li>I have been using these pads for about a month, I am really beginning to see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t really it.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>I wash, tone, then thoroughly rub my whole face with one of these pads</li>
            <li>I recommend both HIGHLY!  </li>
            <li>Really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>blackheads aren&#x27;t really changing.  </li>
            <li>really cleans the pores..</li>
            <li>it leaves a residue and the bottom line is that it doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>and my skin feels so much smoother.  </li>
            <li>With that being said, on occasion when I apply these pads, I do feel a sensation of tingling, not quite stinging, but a buzzing of sorts that lets me know the product is absorbing.  </li>
            <li>If youâ€™re more on the rough and tumble side like I am, I recommend using these pads as often as time permits.  </li>
            <li>I’ve tapered off usage since my skin has improved so much.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m finding it gentle.</li>
            <li>have tiny pores and smooth skin already..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just the discoloration I really want to change.</li>
            <li>Just about a month since I started using them and not seeing any real improvements yet.  </li>
            <li>: I cut the pads into halves and fourths because they are very saturated.</li>
            <li>I really like them.</li>
            <li>Just a cheap maximum strength one from target, they are all the same.  </li>
            <li>I was very dissapointed and will not be buying it again</li>
            <li>I stopped using it for about 1 month thinking that it didn&#x27;t do much to my skin since i didn&#x27;t notice the difference</li>
            <li>It has really helped my skin from breaking out.</li>
            <li>I spent countless hours outdoors with no sun protection which earned me a good amount of freckles and sun spots.</li>
            <li>I think my skin doesn&#x27;t shed its cells fast enough and this really helps keep my pores clean.</li>
            <li>The instructions strongly warn about not keeping it on too long.</li>
            <li>Its super smooth and breaks out a lot less.</li>
            <li>LOVE this and other PTR products.</li>
            <li>I have other peel pads I like better.</li>
            <li>They leave my skin feeling super soft and it definitely looks better the next day.  </li>
            <li>The pads are saturated, which is great because some pads dry out within a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and most products dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>The reason this is 3 stars is because since I have started using this product I have had 7 or 8 actual, full on pimples.</li>
            <li>These are the first peel pads I have had; I have also not had a professional peel either.  </li>
            <li>I did not note less wrinkles, but can&#x27;t say I noted more wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It took too much off my cheeks and ended up getting red splotches all over my right side of the face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The ph is too high for this to work all it did was moisturize.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to you.</li>
            <li>I have always bought the high end skin care items and nothing was helping my hyper-pigmentation or premature aging...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Ordered these pads and they are exactly what I paid full price for on the other site, but a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li>I use it just once a week for a little more exfoliation.</li>
            <li>Left my skin glowing after the first use!</li>
            <li>My pores get easily clogged and I use this every other day.</li>
            <li>As far as wrinkles go, I don&#x27;t really have any</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really liking them so far.</li>
            <li>So far, it has done absolutely nothing for my blackheads or acne scarring.  </li>
            <li>So far I really like them.  </li>
            <li>So far I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I have combination, and sensitive skin and these worked really well.</li>
            <li>However I just can&#x27;t pay that much money 4 times a year, as is needed to keep my skin clear.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;d say this product is worth a shot.</li>
            <li>We need to demand that the products we use not negatively impact our health.  </li>
            <li>I do not have deep wrinkles, but have been concerned about the fine lines and sun spots (recently turned 30, crisis - maybe??).</li>
            <li>I would not use this product daily but several times a week is fine.</li>
            <li>, it provide a light peeling and can be used combined with other treatments products.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m reluctant to try new products.</li>
            <li>the bottle was looking very old ...</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and broke out in hives.</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I also have not had as many breakouts as I usually do.</li>
            <li>I have normal skin, but it tends to be a little sensitive to strong products.  </li>
            <li>My face feels clean and soft after, but no real change.</li>
            <li>The pads are large enough to use on your face,neck, hands an chest area...</li>
            <li>on my chin and to smooth out the overall rough texture,</li>
            <li>This product was clearly unsealed when it arrived.  </li>
            <li>Great but expensive for just removing any facial makeup or grime.</li>
            <li>Helped clear my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helped keeping my pores clear.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn but if you have really sensitive skin, this probably isn&#x27;t the product for you.</li>
            <li>I saw that many complained of opened packages...</li>
            <li>I do have fairly sensitive skin and so far haven&#x27;t had any problems.</li>
            <li>cuz they were probably so old that they it dry,,,as</li>
            <li>but they caused irritation on my sensitive skin.     </li>
            <li>My skin is now soft and has a glow to it.</li>
            <li>have no harsh side effects from this peel (no stinging or burning).</li>
            <li>Am 40 years old</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and tend to break out when I find something that keeps my skin hydrated.  </li>
            <li>is nearly gone.  </li>
            <li>The inner seal was very discolored and almost crumbling.</li>
            <li>since I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a complete believer in this product.</li>
            <li>Does not irritate sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>skin is sensitive and these pads do not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li>I have no attempted using this product on the back of my hand until I read product reviews – thanks.</li>
            <li>As far as wrinkles..</li>
            <li>Completely changed my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 42, I don&#x27;t smoke and I&#x27;m in the early stages of wrinkles and dullness.  </li>
            <li>29 yrs young</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and this doesn&#x27;t cause any problems at all.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this product for a few weeks, but Im pleased with the results already.</li>
            <li>After&lt;br /&gt;cleansing apply to skin, wait 3-5 minutes or a extra few minutes more for extra&lt;br /&gt;benefits of exfoliation.</li>
            <li>If you find that you can only use these pads 1-2 times per week, I still definitely consider it worth the effort.  </li>
            <li>The next day, I do not have any little fine breakouts and redness like I do on the non-peel days.</li>
            <li>Normally when I have ordered from other sources, the pads are super moist but these came in almost dry.  </li>
            <li>The pads have appropriately saturated and can even be cut in half as some other reviewers have suggested.  </li>
            <li>Although hard to pinpoint, it just looks tighter, and brighter (if that&#x27;s possible) and the elasticity is much better.</li>
            <li>Following the recommendation for my skin-type to only utilize them every other day or so... and I can really tell that the new skin is so much fresher and smoother than before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but my few brown spots are fading quickly and over</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing major</li>
            <li>I may upgrade to a stronger less frequent option next, but I started here because I&#x27;m pretty sensitive.</li>
            <li>I try to avoid parabens and peservatives in general.  </li>
            <li>My face was so clear the entire time I used these.</li>
            <li>This product has proven to consistently perform well, and I find that it leaves my skin firm, clear and supple.  </li>
            <li>do look smaller and skin is so soft</li>
            <li>I am a 54 year old male.  </li>
            <li>the little milia \\&quot;seeds\\&quot; would just push right out when I could NEVER get them to come out before, even after steaming.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive fair skin with small broken capillaries</li>
            <li>I usually have to apply moisturizer after use because my skin dries out quickly.</li>
            <li>After washing, I use the peel pads which do sting a bit, rinse after about 2 min., and my face and top of neck immediately feels smoother, refreshed, and firm but not too tight.  </li>
            <li>Only using for a short time so as far as wrinkles I will report again soon.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I feel a slight sting when first applied, but that dosen&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li>I will say that if you have dry or sensitive skin these should prob not be used every day.</li>
            <li>But I am during two other new products also.</li>

            <li> I read excellent reviews about this product on Sephora.com but bought it on Amazon because it&#x27;s cheaper with free shipping here (for a prime user).</li>
            <li> My hands look so good</li>
            <li> I would say these are a good introduction into chemical peels.</li>
            <li> I also found this to be the best price available, both online and in stores.  </li>

            <li> It works great on my fine lines ...</li>
            <li> Its an amazing product.</li>
            <li> Gotta say I really liked it too.</li>
            <li> Make sure you wash your face really good before so the ingredients can do its work.</li>
            <li> Smooths my skin and gives me a nice glow.</li>
            <li> I  will need to review in a month or so to know if it is truly effective.</li>
            <li> Got a sample kit off another cosmetic site, and liked it.</li>
            <li> So, hopefully this product will prove to be effective for the price.</li>
            <li> but this seems a bit more diverse and is doing a good job on blemishes and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I think no matter what kind of skin you have</li>
            <li> but the results are quick and beautiful.</li>
            <li> These pads really do a good job of removing flakiness, and making my skin look clean and bright.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love these - they do sting a bit and don&#x27;t have the most pleasant odor</li>
            <li> It is fine and works good, just do not use to often.</li>
            <li> My skin tone and texture have greatly improved and I&#x27;m not even through my first jar yet!  </li>
            <li> My skin looks bright, smooth and renewed.</li>
            <li> Does not irritate my skin and leave it feeling smooth, bright and refreshed.</li>
            <li> yes you have to use it ...way better than any kind of surgery def</li>
            <li> Love these pads...easy, quick and effective!</li>
            <li> My skin looks amazing, so clear and bright!  </li>
            <li> They help with fine lines, minimize pores &amp; exfoliate!</li>
            <li> These are good if your looking to freshen up your complexion quickly</li>
            <li> Easy to use and effective.  </li>
            <li> But i love it</li>
            <li> &amp; I love them.</li>
            <li> what I could thought of is that the seller opened it just a bit ,pour some liquid or most probably water in it</li>
            <li> I will see how it looks in 3 more months and update this review.  </li>
            <li> Ok, I didn&#x27;t purchase this for my hands, but followed the recommendation on the jar to apply to top  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> I use it about three times a week and my skin does look much better.</li>
            <li> , rinse off, apply your favorite serum and moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Many compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried and it is just ok</li>
            <li> Thought my skin would look &amp; feel better.</li>
            <li> I make sure they are sealed every time I use them</li>
            <li> I am 27 and just love it.</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to use Peter Thomas Roth any more for the reason.</li>
            <li> I would gladly trade shelf life in for a safe product....</li>
            <li> Sure we might not notice immediate effects...but using all these chemicals over time...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product more than once on amazon and love it.</li>
            <li> Again love his products they do work.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin so smooth, even toned, and luminescent!</li>
            <li> My skin looks fantastic for my age, if I do say so myself!</li>
            <li> all my skin looks and feels better.  </li>
            <li> My skin, however, is definitely soft, smooth, and feels great!</li>
            <li> It does leave my face feeling tighter(firmer?) and more radiant.  </li>
            <li> It also helps for better absorption of my skin creams.</li>
            <li> I’m glad my impulse buy has now produced</li>
            <li> Now I’m in more of a maintenance mode.</li>
            <li> It seems that my moisturizer soaks in better into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will buy again, great packaging and fast ship.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of 7 &amp; felt satisfied after the week.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product and service.</li>
            <li> When I was given a sample of the Peter Roth c30 citrus, I fell in love.</li>
            <li> I love these peel pads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed more acne on my skin, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like shiny healthy look after using.</li>
            <li> , she uses PCA which I love .  </li>
            <li> Your skin feels amazing, baby smooth.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> love this stuff</li>
            <li> My skin my more even</li>
            <li> and it looks more supple.  </li>
            <li> Makes my face soft, clean and bright!!</li>
            <li> but they make my skin feel so amazing and clean.</li>
            <li> These are pretty good.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and it&#x27;s better than scrubs.</li>
            <li> Great Product &amp; will for sure be buying more in future!</li>
            <li> I bought these and liked them right off the bat.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t tell you how effective they are as undoing wrinkles, but am very optimistic these will stay a keeper in my facial cleansing routine because they just feel so good on the skin, unbelievably good</li>
            <li> I use it every other night and it works great!</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good about it!</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, works well.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Start with clean skin, apply product on the peel pads onto your face and let it sit on your skin 2-5 minutes then rinse off and apply your favorite serum(mine</li>
            <li> But I emailed amazon and they were able to mail me another one right away.&lt;br /&gt;OK, now about the product!</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t have the same allergic reactions on my cheek area which looked beautifully glowing after just a couple of applications.</li>
            <li> This product arrived in good condition with a unbroken seal brand new jar.</li>
            <li> Fine.</li>
            <li> Seems to take out the fine lines and the blackheads.</li>
            <li> Not as an exfoliator, but almost more like a peel you wipe on and quickly rinse from your face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now, but I have to say I was amazed and satisfied after the first use!</li>
            <li> Then two at the bottom of my chin that were huge and hurt, which never happens.</li>
            <li> Iâ€™m a huge fan.</li>
            <li> I received a real PTR product (determined when comparing with one at Sephora) and it seems to be effective.</li>
            <li> When I rinse off my face it feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> I have had great results and this was my second purchase of it.  </li>
            <li> It gives a fantastic glow.</li>
            <li> Plus you get free samples and still get free shipping because the product alone will qualify.</li>
            <li> That cost about $500 for a package of 3 ( get the strongest available)</li>
            <li> My makeup goes on so smooth and</li>
            <li> It makes my skin look smooth and radiant at 67.&lt;br /&gt;Sold</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see the continuing results as I use them more often - hopefully they help soften the smile lines around my eyes and the worry lines on my forehead.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making such a great product, PTR!</li>
            <li> good product, it can remove the head skin but not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Of natural ingredients and a good combination of peel&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients to cover a multitude of skin conditions.</li>
            <li> but I just love this and can see a difference right away.</li>
            <li> My breakouts were becoming more and more frequent and not even my ProActiv regimen was not working.  </li>
            <li> These are quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great, light product that goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvements to fine lines yet (have some mild frown lines</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money to give it a shot if you are considering!</li>
            <li> First of all, I would like to say that I love this product</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t enjoy physical exfoliants but can tolerate chemical ones fairly well.</li>
            <li> My pores look smaller, skin is softer and dewy and my moisturizer is much more effective because it can get into my skin.  </li>
            <li> I thought that I could just keep them bedside and use them to clean my face when I wanted.</li>
            <li> I am a skin care junkie and PTR has really great products and these simply make any of their other products 10 times more effective.  </li>
            <li> Been using these for years and my skin is so smooth and wrinkle free thanks to this product!  </li>
            <li> I am not 100% sure that this is the real product.</li>
            <li> I tried it out a Sephora and loved it, but this feels different.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a true peel, even over time...</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll need more time to really tell if there&#x27;s a difference&lt;</li>
            <li> a good facial cleanser I didnt feel any tingle or saw any difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Most other products only come with around 30 pads, so its a month supply at best if you just use once a day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other pads similar to these, and I think these have best ingredients, and perform better.</li>
            <li> They give you a nice little glow but doesn&#x27;t do anything that spectacular.  </li>
            <li> With consistent use my fine lines are gone.</li>
            <li> If you use it daily or even twice a day, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll see even better results than me.</li>
            <li> A mild exfoliant to use in between stronger peels.</li>
            <li> its mild on skin.</li>
            <li> The process takes less than five minutes to complete but the rewards are awesome – I receive many compliments about my clean and clear skin.</li>
            <li> I recommend using a good hydrating cream after each treatment to minimize dry patches.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with my purchase, you really CAN feel a difference after the first application.  </li>
            <li> They work really well on fine lines and pores</li>
            <li> this product is very good for cleaning the skin, especially if you do not have time to go for a facial</li>
            <li> I use it at night (gently rubbing in circular motion, then let sit for a couple minutes) and follow up with PTR \\&quot;Laser Free Regenerator\\&quot; moisturizing gel cream.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of all the dead skin and makes my skin feel great afterwards.</li>
            <li> They really help to exfoliate and smooth my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is sorta sensitive, acne prone, mostly oily.</li>
            <li> I love these so far.</li>
            <li> Not too harsh but a good light peel.</li>
            <li> Skin looks fresh</li>
            <li> Makes appearance fresh</li>
            <li> This product is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Again, rare.</li>
            <li> According to the ingredients listed here- most are natural.  </li>
            <li> It came sealed and completely fresh.</li>
            <li> Worth a try.</li>
            <li> It seems to leave the skin looking and feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> Using those once a week, I figured it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> As far as texture my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for Asian or other ethnic cystic acne prone skin</li>
            <li> these pads really work; i have fibromyalgia and don&#x27;t have much energy to do anything; these are easy to use and really can feel them working; they make my skin look more radiant and clear and smooth; will use them the rest of my life</li>
            <li> I like to use it right after I get out of the shower and leave it on for about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> I am placing a re-order right after typing this review.  </li>
            <li> After the first peel my skin felt smooth and much nicer.</li>
            <li> so this was very unexpected, especially after all the good reviews.</li>
            <li> Still waiting to see results on fine lines but skin feels soft and fresh after using.</li>
            <li> Also cut pads in half with good saturation.</li>
            <li> Right now I have one at the edge of my upper lip which is really sexy, let me tell you.</li>
            <li> My pores are cleaner and smaller and my fine lines are going away!  </li>
            <li> After the first use, my face was smooth, soft and gleaming!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shopped, no outdated product, and no shipping!</li>
            <li> Those um \\&quot;age spots\\&quot;, so much lighter!</li>
            <li> After the first use, I noticed a glow to my skin and a smoothness.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the speedy shipping once again!</li>
            <li> Love these this is my second batch</li>
            <li> so my face was pretty well exfoliated, but I do see my skin brighter w/ these pad.</li>
            <li> and you have more than enough product for your face.  </li>
            <li> I have been sent many to reviews today and keep getting them back to review again.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say anything about the long term effects yet, but so far, so good.  </li>
            <li> Before using this I haven&#x27;t had any on my forehead in YEARS, and I got 2 within the first week.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these peel pads, just enough of a tingle to know they are working.  </li>
            <li> I have been using them for over a month and most definitely see a difference</li>
            <li> It does what it promisses, but you have to be consistent with using it.</li>
            <li> Broke out after first use</li>
            <li> As long as I don&#x27;t become red or break out, I&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li> Definitely saw smoother, softer, more youthful skin...but didn&#x27;t seem to help with sun and post acne marks.  </li>
            <li> Does anyone know a way to salvage these without requesting more and having the inconvenience of sending back?</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t burn but when I exhaled out of my nose, my breath felt hot.</li>
            <li> Made my foundation go on much smoother!</li>
            <li> and this is my first review.</li>
            <li> I use another pad after the first one dries.</li>
            <li> Amazon did a great job on responding to complaint.</li>
            <li> and i really noticed the difference!</li>
            <li> I have only used this product 3x, but so far I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I have used them every evening on clean skin for a month so far and cannot believe the results…</li>
            <li> My skin felt so soft and clean after using it one time.</li>
            <li> I only use this about 3-4 times a week but its safe for every day use because its so gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> Everyone needs this products makes your skin smooth , firm, love it</li>
            <li> IF, any is left, use on the top of the hands which accrue much damage from the sun.</li>
            <li> highly recommend these pads because they’re easy to use and not messy.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t noticed any positive difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I am positive</li>
            <li> My skin positively gleams after use and that always puts a twinkle in my eyes and a skip in my step.  </li>
            <li> after first week a real difference in smoothing wrinkles and texture of my face</li>
            <li> I happen to have combination skin that can pretty much take a beating.  </li>
            <li> I think if you are a bit younger it might work a lot better than it does for this older gal.</li>
            <li> First, I have very oily skin and large pores.</li>
            <li> These are great pads normally but the ones that arrived were dingy yellow, packaging corroded and smelled differently than the normal ones.</li>
            <li> I have not been using them long (about two weeks), so I can&#x27;t comment on the wrinkle reducing power, but they really do wonders for softening skin and making it more luminescent.  </li>
            <li> The first thing you&#x27;ll notice after you wash it off is your skin will feel really soft and fresh.</li>
            <li> no noticeable change in my large pores around nose and chin.</li>
            <li> I do not have large pores</li>
            <li> I CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT THESE!!</li>
            <li> in my early 30s and have early signs of fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> About a month after I started using this product I noticed a huge differents in my skin especially in my t-zone area.</li>
            <li> I have VERY oily skin.  </li>
            <li> Really like htis product.  </li>
            <li> Even my boyfriend noticed and asked me what happened to my skin because it looked much smoother and healthier.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much happen.</li>
            <li> so much so, I was compelled to write this review.  </li>
            <li> You know every once in a while I buy something that works really well.</li>
            <li> I have been using these pads for about a month, I am really beginning to see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t really it.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> I wash, tone, then thoroughly rub my whole face with one of these pads</li>
            <li> I recommend both HIGHLY!  </li>
            <li> Really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> blackheads aren&#x27;t really changing.  </li>
            <li> really cleans the pores..</li>
            <li> it leaves a residue and the bottom line is that it doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> and my skin feels so much smoother.  </li>
            <li> With that being said, on occasion when I apply these pads, I do feel a sensation of tingling, not quite stinging, but a buzzing of sorts that lets me know the product is absorbing.  </li>
            <li> If youâ€™re more on the rough and tumble side like I am, I recommend using these pads as often as time permits.  </li>
            <li> I’ve tapered off usage since my skin has improved so much.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m finding it gentle.</li>
            <li> have tiny pores and smooth skin already..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just the discoloration I really want to change.</li>
            <li> Just about a month since I started using them and not seeing any real improvements yet.  </li>
            <li> : I cut the pads into halves and fourths because they are very saturated.</li>
            <li> I really like them.</li>
            <li> Just a cheap maximum strength one from target, they are all the same.  </li>
            <li> I was very dissapointed and will not be buying it again</li>
            <li> I stopped using it for about 1 month thinking that it didn&#x27;t do much to my skin since i didn&#x27;t notice the difference</li>
            <li> It has really helped my skin from breaking out.</li>
            <li> I spent countless hours outdoors with no sun protection which earned me a good amount of freckles and sun spots.</li>
            <li> I think my skin doesn&#x27;t shed its cells fast enough and this really helps keep my pores clean.</li>
            <li> The instructions strongly warn about not keeping it on too long.</li>
            <li> Its super smooth and breaks out a lot less.</li>
            <li> LOVE this and other PTR products.</li>
            <li> I have other peel pads I like better.</li>
            <li> They leave my skin feeling super soft and it definitely looks better the next day.  </li>
            <li> The pads are saturated, which is great because some pads dry out within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and most products dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> The reason this is 3 stars is because since I have started using this product I have had 7 or 8 actual, full on pimples.</li>
            <li> These are the first peel pads I have had; I have also not had a professional peel either.  </li>
            <li> I did not note less wrinkles, but can&#x27;t say I noted more wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It took too much off my cheeks and ended up getting red splotches all over my right side of the face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The ph is too high for this to work all it did was moisturize.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to you.</li>
            <li> I have always bought the high end skin care items and nothing was helping my hyper-pigmentation or premature aging...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Ordered these pads and they are exactly what I paid full price for on the other site, but a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> I use it just once a week for a little more exfoliation.</li>
            <li> Left my skin glowing after the first use!</li>
            <li> My pores get easily clogged and I use this every other day.</li>
            <li> As far as wrinkles go, I don&#x27;t really have any</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking them so far.</li>
            <li> So far, it has done absolutely nothing for my blackheads or acne scarring.  </li>
            <li> So far I really like them.  </li>
            <li> So far I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I have combination, and sensitive skin and these worked really well.</li>
            <li> However I just can&#x27;t pay that much money 4 times a year, as is needed to keep my skin clear.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;d say this product is worth a shot.</li>
            <li> We need to demand that the products we use not negatively impact our health.  </li>
            <li> I do not have deep wrinkles, but have been concerned about the fine lines and sun spots (recently turned 30, crisis - maybe??).</li>
            <li> I would not use this product daily but several times a week is fine.</li>
            <li> , it provide a light peeling and can be used combined with other treatments products.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m reluctant to try new products.</li>
            <li> the bottle was looking very old ...</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and broke out in hives.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I also have not had as many breakouts as I usually do.</li>
            <li> I have normal skin, but it tends to be a little sensitive to strong products.  </li>
            <li> My face feels clean and soft after, but no real change.</li>
            <li> The pads are large enough to use on your face,neck, hands an chest area...</li>
            <li> on my chin and to smooth out the overall rough texture,</li>
            <li> This product was clearly unsealed when it arrived.  </li>
            <li> Great but expensive for just removing any facial makeup or grime.</li>
            <li> Helped clear my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped keeping my pores clear.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn but if you have really sensitive skin, this probably isn&#x27;t the product for you.</li>
            <li> I saw that many complained of opened packages...</li>
            <li> I do have fairly sensitive skin and so far haven&#x27;t had any problems.</li>
            <li> cuz they were probably so old that they it dry,,,as</li>
            <li> but they caused irritation on my sensitive skin.     </li>
            <li> My skin is now soft and has a glow to it.</li>
            <li> have no harsh side effects from this peel (no stinging or burning).</li>
            <li> Am 40 years old</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and tend to break out when I find something that keeps my skin hydrated.  </li>
            <li> is nearly gone.  </li>
            <li> The inner seal was very discolored and almost crumbling.</li>
            <li> since I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a complete believer in this product.</li>
            <li> Does not irritate sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> skin is sensitive and these pads do not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I have no attempted using this product on the back of my hand until I read product reviews – thanks.</li>
            <li> As far as wrinkles..</li>
            <li> Completely changed my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 42, I don&#x27;t smoke and I&#x27;m in the early stages of wrinkles and dullness.  </li>
            <li> 29 yrs young</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and this doesn&#x27;t cause any problems at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for a few weeks, but Im pleased with the results already.</li>
            <li> After&lt;br /&gt;cleansing apply to skin, wait 3-5 minutes or a extra few minutes more for extra&lt;br /&gt;benefits of exfoliation.</li>
            <li> If you find that you can only use these pads 1-2 times per week, I still definitely consider it worth the effort.  </li>
            <li> The next day, I do not have any little fine breakouts and redness like I do on the non-peel days.</li>
            <li> Normally when I have ordered from other sources, the pads are super moist but these came in almost dry.  </li>
            <li> The pads have appropriately saturated and can even be cut in half as some other reviewers have suggested.  </li>
            <li> Although hard to pinpoint, it just looks tighter, and brighter (if that&#x27;s possible) and the elasticity is much better.</li>
            <li> Following the recommendation for my skin-type to only utilize them every other day or so... and I can really tell that the new skin is so much fresher and smoother than before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but my few brown spots are fading quickly and over</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing major</li>
            <li> I may upgrade to a stronger less frequent option next, but I started here because I&#x27;m pretty sensitive.</li>
            <li> I try to avoid parabens and peservatives in general.  </li>
            <li> My face was so clear the entire time I used these.</li>
            <li> This product has proven to consistently perform well, and I find that it leaves my skin firm, clear and supple.  </li>
            <li> do look smaller and skin is so soft</li>
            <li> I am a 54 year old male.  </li>
            <li> the little milia \\&quot;seeds\\&quot; would just push right out when I could NEVER get them to come out before, even after steaming.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive fair skin with small broken capillaries</li>
            <li> I usually have to apply moisturizer after use because my skin dries out quickly.</li>
            <li> After washing, I use the peel pads which do sting a bit, rinse after about 2 min., and my face and top of neck immediately feels smoother, refreshed, and firm but not too tight.  </li>
            <li> Only using for a short time so as far as wrinkles I will report again soon.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I feel a slight sting when first applied, but that dosen&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> I will say that if you have dry or sensitive skin these should prob not be used every day.</li>
            <li> But I am during two other new products also.</li>
            <li> I cut the pads in half (making a 60 count a 120 count this lasting twice as long) and it&#x27;s enough to do my whole face and neck</li>
            <li> I use it almost every day and have seen dramatic results in fine lines on forehead, reduced blackheads and overall skin brightness.</li>
            <li> With cystic acne it is difficult to find products strong enough to penetrate that deep, this does it!  </li>
            <li> Peter Thomas Roth Un-wrinkle Peel Pads were highly rated on a few sites I trust.</li>
            <li> Product was not sealed so it&#x27;s smells funny and is not effective.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve seen no difference in the short or long term.</li>
            <li> Peter Thomas Roth Un-Wrinkle Peel Pads are as reliable as that old friend that you can always depend upon when your car breaks down or if you need a ride home from the bar.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and I&#x27;m not wearing foundation, only powder and a little concealer.</li>
            <li> I use this almost daily; as I have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Moisturize well after use on your face, especially if you have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Big object (dog food) crushed smaller objects.  </li>
            <li> Products all tossed into one big box loose.</li>
            <li> I did not have wrinkles, but I bought this for the glycolic acid as it is efficient in zapping acne and dark spots and blemishes which was my major concern.</li>
            <li> I used these pads regularly and noticed smaller pores but no improvement in dark spots.</li>
            <li> INGREDIENTS LISTED HERE IS NOT COMPLETE LIST.  </li>
            <li> I mean does this product really need to keep longer than one or two months??  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it regularly enough to notice any extreme results yet though.</li>
            <li> I use this product about every other day or every 3rd day</li>
            <li> As other say  my skin is smoother and pores are smaller.  </li>
            <li> I have not had any problem with irritation or dryness and I use them about every other day, although I could probably use them daily with no problem.</li>
            <li> I am on acne medication and use other topical ointments.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li> Only been using them for a few weeks now, only a couple of times a week</li>
            <li> I have been plagued with acne/black head prone skin since my teens and now I have adult acne and black heads with blemishes and dark spots.  </li>
            <li> It is really only your average face pads.</li>
            <li> and I think it pulls things from deep down to the surface.</li>
            <li> I had rough spots, whiteheads, dry patches, etc.</li>
            <li> I cut mine in half and still have enough product on the pads to cover the areas I mentioned.</li>
            <li> I cut these in half and they last longer.  </li>
            <li> and I thought these would help clear it up, but they haven&#x27;t made a noticeable difference (at least not yet).  </li>
            <li> You do feel a tingle but has no real smell.  </li>
            <li> Whether I&#x27;m just an anomaly or not is unknown however this skin care product made no visible difference on my skin.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> , I might upgrade them to a 5 star review in the next few weeks if I notice any help with the clogged pores.</li>
            <li> and my skin began feeling rough.  </li>
            <li> The uneven skin tone has improved since starting to use the pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smoother, younger looking skin after just a few applications.</li>
            <li> I have ethnic olive complexion  with lots of oil and dead skin, i&#x27;m native american.  </li>
            <li> The only reason this did not receive 5stars is that it&#x27;s overly harsh on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, caution to the beauties with  sensitive skin - slow go for you.  </li>
            <li> way smaller and black heads gone!</li>
            <li> This product does make my skin feel smoother and isn&#x27;t irritating (I have very sensitive, dry skin and use it once a week).  </li>
            <li> I am 37 years old, with olive skin and was beginning to have serious issues with dryness, breakouts and hyperpigmentation.  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers said, I cut the pads in half because they are moist enough to use just half a pad in the a.m. and half at night.</li>
            <li> rough up your skin with scrubs!  </li>
            <li> I used every other day for one week and now use 2-3 times a week.  </li>
            <li> Be forewarned as other users have said you need to keep up with use.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this pads after reading the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> I look forward to trying out other products from this brand.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure if I have the actual product.  </li>
            <li> I’m always skeptical when purchasing new skin care products because I always assume they will end up in my drawer full of useless ones.  </li>
            <li> Sorry dear ,now matter how smart u thought u were</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first when I ordered this product.</li>
            <li> Now, although not as drastic, I have noticed improvements to dark acne scars on my face and some cystic type acne along my jawline</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I have some clogged pores on my t-zone</li>
            <li> It is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> It did lighten up my dark spots.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care ,took it out ,and saw the seal was very cleverly broken ,it was opened just near 2 inches</li>
            <li> I also alternate putting a thick coat of silica acid gel and benzoic peroxide cream on after the morning peel gel.</li>
            <li> It also made my face extremely oily!  </li>
            <li> (You think it would be the other way around!)</li>
            <li> cleanse my skin as usual and then use a single pad on my face, neck and around my eye area.</li>
            <li> I purchased these pad and did as others suggested; cut the pads in half</li>
            <li> I like to cut the pads in half</li>
            <li> A half of a pad is plenty.</li>
            <li> The 1st week i left it on for 1 min because i was afraid that my sensitive skin will be irritated.</li>
            <li> The pads are large and concentrated, so I found cutting the pads in half covers the face, neck and chest.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a month now</li>
            <li> Could maybe be a little &amp;#34;stronger&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Tingles a little</li>
            <li> after just a few uses</li>
            <li> I recorded it today ,was so looking forward to use it ,,,it wasn&#x27;t in any box ,the round jar was just wrapped in a plastic bubble wrap and put in a shopping carton ,,,</li>
            <li> What a waste of time.</li>
            <li> I have been useing tho for a few week now.</li>
            <li> I can tell there&#x27;s an improvement in just a few weeks..</li>
            <li> When opened, the pads were dried looking and yellowed.  </li>
            <li> And that is just after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> recommend trying a few pads before buying and see how your skin reacts to this product</li>
            <li> It peeled a few years off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too harsh and it removes the dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> I buy on Amazon a few times a month</li>
            <li> on his peeling gel firm exfoliant also.</li>
            <li> I also had some uneven skin and discoloration that may have been caused by poor sunscreen use in my younger years.</li>
            <li> I have used 120 pads in all and my skin is glowing, has no more break out black heads and alebit</li>
            <li> What I try to do is use this at least one time a week at night (I use a retinoid on the other nights).</li>
            <li> what the seller failed to understand is that by doing such fraud ,he&#x27;s losing his customers ,I regret I didn&#x27;t read the other reviews before who complained abt the same broken seal ,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Especially bad with humid or hot weather, I found.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have bad skin, but I do notice that my pores have all shrunk.</li>
            <li> Could tell a difference within a few days!</li>
            <li> but unfortunately when I had about a 1/4 of the pads left</li>
            <li> Not sure about any wrinkle reduction</li>
            <li> Also, I usually leave it on my skin for 5-60 minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure yet</li>
            <li> It looked like my pores and small wrinkles disappeared on my face.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t have a ton of wrinkles to begin with, so I&#x27;m not sure whether or not there are improvements there.  </li>
            <li> so I know I&#x27;m going to have to re-up on these in a few weeks!</li>
            <li> After a few days of use I was already seeing results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that some dry patches I had on my forehead have gone away, but I haven&#x27;t broken out, which usually happens when I find something that works this well!  </li>
            <li> Made my skin feel dry and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Hardly any tape holding box shut.</li>
            <li> So far my skin has been breaking out really badly since using this</li>
            <li> Thought my skin would have seen an improvement after at least 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> these products are slowly killing us.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> One reviewer suggest cutting them in half</li>
            <li> Plus, I was cutting them in half.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind my skin is really tough.  </li>
            <li> My skin is starting to peel just a little but nothing nasty looking.</li>
            <li> ,I could tell the seal was broken ...</li>
            <li> After reading some of the negative comments on here with regard to \\&quot;freshness\\&quot; of the product, I ordered them from Sephora because you can&#x27;t go wrong that route.</li>
            <li> tired this winter and after just two days of use, my face is glowing again.  </li>
            <li> and I can tell a dramatic difference.  </li>
            <li> This product, however, didn&#x27;t cause irritation, but weirdly, I now have acnes on some parts of my skin that I used this product on: hand, forehead, belly.</li>
            <li> but for now, they have a weird odor after you apply and a thicker residue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but cheaper to buy it on Amazon than in the stores.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a game changer for the aging process!</li>
            <li> The sad part is that I decided to buy here</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> Very poor packaging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late twenties, and hate that my skin isn&#x27;t what it used to be.</li>
            <li> But I am breastfeeding and was looking for products without dangerous chemicals in them.  </li>
            <li> I will attribute this to the \\&quot;bad stuff\\&quot; being worked out and I will continue using the pads, since the benefits outweigh the concerns.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to use the product because it wasn&#x27;t sealed!</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Try these, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was about to give the producted order from this company 3 stars but hate to do that to the product when I feel it was the company.  </li>
            <li> Broke my face out horribly!  </li>
            <li> It evened out and corrected those annoying problems and my skin felt moisturized after!</li>
            <li> This product made me break out, horribly.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 weeks . no noticeable change in my large pores around nose and chin. You do feel a tingle while applying the pad.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I will be procuring this product again.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product to a friend</li>
            <li> after first week a real difference in smoothing wrinkles and texture of my face</li>
            <li> I purchased these and used them about twice a week.  They give you a nice little glow but doesn&#x27;t do anything that spectacular.  Makes you look refreshed though</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!! Does everything it says it wiill do. Those um \\&quot;age spots\\&quot;, so much lighter! Pores?-way smaller! My skin has never looked better! I use it every other night and it works great!</li>
            <li> My skin is sorta sensitive, acne prone, mostly oily. It doesn&#x27;t enjoy physical exfoliants but can tolerate chemical ones fairly well. I started using this once a day and now am using it twice a day and it has transformed my skin. Its super smooth and breaks out a lot less. I think my skin doesn&#x27;t shed its cells fast enough and this really helps keep my pores clean. It doesn&#x27;t burn but if you have really sensitive skin, this probably isn&#x27;t the product for you. As far as wrinkles go, I don&#x27;t really have any ( I&#x27;m 30) so I can&#x27;t speak about its affect on wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I saw that many complained of opened packages...mine arrived in a sealed jar and I LOVE IT!! It works great on my fine lines ...after just a few uses i feel my skin looks smoother. I plan to buy again. I think if you recieve an opened jar you should return it. But i love it and i think it was a great buy!!</li>
            <li> I have only used this product 3x, but so far I absolutely love it! I use it at night (gently rubbing in circular motion, then let sit for a couple minutes) and follow up with PTR \\&quot;Laser Free Regenerator\\&quot; moisturizing gel cream. My skin feels great and seems to look more radiant already! I do not have deep wrinkles, but have been concerned about the fine lines and sun spots (recently turned 30, crisis - maybe??). I do have fairly sensitive skin and so far haven&#x27;t had any problems. As of now, I&#x27;d buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I love these so far. I havn&#x27;t had them a month yet but already my pores are way smaller and black heads gone! My skin is starting to peel just a little but nothing nasty looking. I&#x27;m really liking them so far. I&#x27;ll keep using them to see what results I keep getting.</li>
            <li> First, I have very oily skin and large pores. I was looking for something to help control the oil and my aesthetician recommended these pads. Not only do they help w the oil problem, but my skin has a glow to it. I&#x27;ve only been using these a week &amp; I love them. I will say that if you have dry or sensitive skin these should prob not be used every day.</li>
            <li> After only 5 uses I already see improvement in hyperpigmentation from acne!  These will be a permanent part of my skin care routine!</li>
            <li> Sorry dear ,now matter how smart u thought u were ,I could tell the seal was broken ...I recorded it today ,was so looking forward to use it ,,,it wasn&#x27;t in any box ,the round jar was just wrapped in a plastic bubble wrap and put in a shopping carton ,,,I didn&#x27;t care ,took it out ,and saw the seal was very cleverly broken ,it was opened just near 2 inches ,the renaming seal was intact...what I could thought of is that the seller opened it just a bit ,pour some liquid or most probably water in it cuz they were probably so old that they it dry,,,as the bottle was looking very old ...what the seller failed to understand is that by doing such fraud ,he&#x27;s losing his customers ,I regret I didn&#x27;t read the other reviews before who complained abt the same broken seal ,anyway I&#x27;m returning it now ...</li>
            <li> After the first use, I noticed a glow to my skin and a smoothness. After the 2nd - 3rd use I noticed by blackheads disappearing and pores diminsh. LOVE this and other PTR products. He&#x27;s Genius. Thanks for the speedy shipping once again!</li>
            <li> I have been plagued with acne/black head prone skin since my teens and now I have adult acne and black heads with blemishes and dark spots.  Every evening, after my work out before taking shower I use the pad on the face, neck, back (prone to break outs) and then wash it off. I have used 120 pads in all and my skin is glowing, has no more break out black heads and alebit I did not have wrinkles, but I bought this for the glycolic acid as it is efficient in zapping acne and dark spots and blemishes which was my major concern.</li>
            <li> As an African-American woman, I am not prone to wrinkles.  As I approach 40, however, I have noticed some differences in my skin.  It just did not have that youthful glow anymore.  After using this for 3 weeks, my skin looks great.  I have VERY oily skin.  So, I used this twice a day.  No drying.  No breakouts.</li>
            <li> Really like htis product.  Not too harsh but a good light peel.</li>
            <li> I received a real PTR product (determined when comparing with one at Sephora) and it seems to be effective. I haven&#x27;t used it regularly enough to notice any extreme results yet though.</li>
            <li> This product does make my skin feel smoother and isn&#x27;t irritating (I have very sensitive, dry skin and use it once a week).  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 weeks.  So far, it has done absolutely nothing for my blackheads or acne scarring.  I will see how it looks in 3 more months and update this review.  I also use the 10% moisturizer daily on my acne scars and neither of these products have made an iota of difference.</li>
            <li> This won&#x27;t peel anything.  The ph is too high for this to work all it did was moisturize.  What a waste of time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy from this company. I am contacting my cousin at the BBB as this came opened and I cant get in touch with the company that I bought this from. this is not PTR. I have used this for years and it smells different and is a scam. I work for the IRS and am talking to my boss today to see what can be done unless I am contacted by them.</li>
            <li> It is fine and works good, just do not use to often.</li>
            <li> Bottom line - these don&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I read excellent reviews about this product on Sephora.com but bought it on Amazon because it&#x27;s cheaper with free shipping here (for a prime user). I&#x27;ve used the alpha and the beta pads but they caused irritation on my sensitive skin.     This product, however, didn&#x27;t cause irritation, but weirdly, I now have acnes on some parts of my skin that I used this product on: hand, forehead, belly. But I don&#x27;t have the same allergic reactions on my cheek area which looked beautifully glowing after just a couple of applications. Even my boyfriend noticed and asked me what happened to my skin because it looked much smoother and healthier. So I&#x27;m going to use this product once a week and gradually increase the frequency of the usage as the label of this product recommends.     Overall, I&#x27;d say this product is worth a shot.</li>
            <li> I use these on my face, neck and the backs of my hands.  This is the second jar I&#x27;ve gotten, so you know I like it.  It&#x27;s helping remove crow&#x27;s feet and the lines I&#x27;m starting to get on my hands too.</li>
            <li> Love these this is my second batch my container too was open a bit but smelled and worked the same as the one that came in tacked</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference.  My skin feels the same.</li>
            <li> Peter Thomas Roth Un-wrinkle Peel Pads were highly rated on a few sites I trust. Gotta say I really liked it too. The instructions strongly warn about not keeping it on too long. For about a month I erred on the side of caution. Didn&#x27;t see much happen. After that I kept it on 5 minutes 3 times a week. Nice results!</li>
            <li> My wife uses these and is very happy with them also this is the best price she has found.</li>
            <li> Ok, I didn&#x27;t purchase this for my hands, but followed the recommendation on the jar to apply to top  my hands...well I&#x27;ve been using daily for about 2 1/2 weeks and today I noticed how all of these tiny scars I had from years of dryness and itchy raised bumps which occurred in the winter were ALL gone. My hands look so good, I couldn&#x27;t stop staring at them. Definitely younger looking. Give the product 5 stars for hands. Now, although not as drastic, I have noticed improvements to dark acne scars on my face and some cystic type acne along my jawline are all gone. I&#x27;m almost to the point we I can get away w/ not wearing foundation...my ultimate cosmetic goal in life (I&#x27;ll be 40 soon, w/ oily acne prone skin). I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvements to fine lines yet (have some mild frown lines and I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes yet, but still hopeful. I should also mention before switching to this, I would use my Clarisonic daily and use regular facial scrubs so my face was pretty well exfoliated, but I do see my skin brighter w/ these pad. Try it!</li>
            <li> My face was so clear the entire time I used these.</li>
            <li> Great Product &amp; will for sure be buying more in future!</li>
            <li> I cannot comment on how this product works since I haven&#x27;t used it!  I&#x27;m afraid to use the product because it wasn&#x27;t sealed!</li>
            <li> I’m always skeptical when purchasing new skin care products because I always assume they will end up in my drawer full of useless ones.  I am 37 years old, with olive skin and was beginning to have serious issues with dryness, breakouts and hyperpigmentation.  My breakouts were becoming more and more frequent and not even my ProActiv regimen was not working.  I purchased these pad and did as others suggested; cut the pads in half and you have more than enough product for your face.  I have used them every evening on clean skin for a month so far and cannot believe the results… so much so, I was compelled to write this review.  My pores look smaller, skin is softer and dewy and my moisturizer is much more effective because it can get into my skin.  My splotches of hyperpigmentation and acne have faded and I could not be happier.</li>
            <li> You know every once in a while I buy something that works really well. This is one of those items. It does what it states it will do while not ruining your skin with dryness, peeling or redness. Its really a wonderful product. I get complements on my skin all the time now. Leaves you wih a dewy refreshed glow. This product will be incorporated into my product hall of fame I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for a few weeks, but Im pleased with the results already. Noticing smoother skin. And it&#x27;s so easy to use. Using it every night on my 50+ skin. Followed by moisturizer of course.</li>
            <li> I have been useing tho for a few week now. It seems to be doing a deep cleaning and I think it pulls things from deep down to the surface. I use it about three times a week and my skin does look much better. But I am during two other new products also.</li>
            <li> Could tell a difference within a few days! Didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.  I highly recommend this product to you.</li>
            <li> Product came on time, but was not sealed. Looked like it had already been opened. Yuck! Packaging department should check products before tossing them into box.  Products all tossed into one big box loose. Big object (dog food) crushed smaller objects.  Very poor packaging. Hardly any tape holding box shut.</li>
            <li> I Have noticed a big difference in my skin. My skin is now soft and has a glow to it. Great product and in easy transaction will buy again from seller.</li>
            <li> I am always leery or products that say that get rid of wrinkles.  I use this almost daily; as I have dry skin.  You do feel a tingle but has no real smell.  When I rinse off my face it feel so smooth. I then follow the PeterThomasRoth&#x27;s cream for the mouth area.  Skin looks fresh and I believe it is working</li>
            <li> This product arrived in good condition with a unbroken seal brand new jar. Have been&lt;br /&gt;using this product once a week. Also cut pads in half with good saturation. After&lt;br /&gt;cleansing apply to skin, wait 3-5 minutes or a extra few minutes more for extra&lt;br /&gt;benefits of exfoliation., rinse off, apply your favorite serum and moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I have no harsh side effects from this peel (no stinging or burning). I also&lt;br /&gt;use Peter Thomas Roth gel exfoliate gel in conjunction with the peel pads. (i.e. use&lt;br /&gt;pads in the beginning of week- gel toward end of week). Happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;My 65+ skin is looking brighter and skin tone is improving and looking more&lt;br /&gt;even.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Peter Thomas Roth and Amazon.  Will reorder.</li>
            <li> I have been using these pads for about a month, I am really beginning to see a difference in my skin. Although hard to pinpoint, it just looks tighter, and brighter (if that&#x27;s possible) and the elasticity is much better. These are quick and easy to use. As other reviewers said, I cut the pads in half because they are moist enough to use just half a pad in the a.m. and half at night. Definitely worth the money to give it a shot if you are considering! Just take a before and after picture (I wish I would have done that, as I know I could see a difference).</li>
            <li> Product was received UNSEALED. This indicates that the product may have been tampered with. Dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> Whether I&#x27;m just an anomaly or not is unknown however this skin care product made no visible difference on my skin. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> This is only the second time I have purchased these.  Went for awhile without them and decided to try them again. Great to use instead of a toner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a month now and I really like it. The fact that it comes with 60 pads is a big plus. Most other products only come with around 30 pads, so its a month supply at best if you just use once a day. I only use this about 3-4 times a week but its safe for every day use because its so gentle on the skin. Make sure you wash your face really good before so the ingredients can do its work. I like to use it right after I get out of the shower and leave it on for about 3 minutes. The first thing you&#x27;ll notice after you wash it off is your skin will feel really soft and fresh. I don&#x27;t really have bad skin, but I do notice that my pores have all shrunk. If you use it daily or even twice a day, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll see even better results than me. I&#x27;ll continue to order this product when I run out.</li>
            <li> I have other peel pads I like better. These are good if your looking to freshen up your complexion quickly</li>
            <li> I am not 100% sure that this is the real product. I tried it out a Sephora and loved it, but this feels different. So far my skin has been breaking out really badly since using this and I haven&#x27;t noticed any positive difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> A great cleanser/toner.  If you are looking for a true peel, even over time... This isn&#x27;t really it. I use them still. My face feels clean and soft after, but no real change.</li>
            <li> This product has refreshed my skin. I use this on my face and neck then apply the peter roth retinol after. My skin looks great! I am 38 and get mistaken for 29 all the time</li>
            <li> Been using these for years and my skin is so smooth and wrinkle free thanks to this product!  Am 40 years old and I use it with skinceuticals products,,, works well.  I use them twice per week and when i have any events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t rough up your skin with scrubs!  These pads are the best peels!</li>
            <li> Makes appearance fresh</li>
            <li> Wonderful....wonderful!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product twice and I really like it. It&#x27;s easy to use, works well. Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin. Could maybe be a little &amp;#34;stronger&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I am positive I reviewed this product already.  I have been sent many to reviews today and keep getting them back to review again.  I do this as a favor for those who would like to purchase, but if Amazon continues to send them back time and time again, I will not review anymore.  This product does what it says it does.  I have had great results and this was my second purchase of it.  It was packaged well and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> These pads are wonderful. With consistent use my fine lines are gone. But like everything else you must keep up the use. I used every other day for one week and now use 2-3 times a week.  I look 40 and am 50.  Many compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li> Broke my face out horribly!  It also made my face extremely oily!  Total waste of money.  Glytone makes an awesome glycolic peel</li>
            <li> These Peel Pads are excellent!  My skin tone and texture have greatly improved and I&#x27;m not even through my first jar yet!  I use them morning and night after I wash my face.  My wrinkles have diminished as well.  I&#x27;ve also noticed that some dry patches I had on my forehead have gone away, but I haven&#x27;t broken out, which usually happens when I find something that works this well!  I have sensitive skin and tend to break out when I find something that keeps my skin hydrated.  I will continue to use these and recommend them to a lot of people!  I can even go without make-up now, just some sunscreen and I&#x27;m all set!  Thanks for making such a great product, PTR!</li>
            <li> I bought these and liked them right off the bat.  I saw results within a couple days.  Then I began to forget to use them every night.  I went back to using them EVERY NIGHT and my hyper-pigmentation is nearly gone.  My pores are cleaner and smaller and my fine lines are going away!  I wash, tone, then thoroughly rub my whole face with one of these pads and I let it sit for 5 minutes.  Then I throw a splash of water on my face (to not thoroughly-thoroughly rinse it off) and then I moisturize.  I have always bought the high end skin care items and nothing was helping my hyper-pigmentation or premature aging...NOT LIKE THIS DOES!  I CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT THESE!!</li>
            <li> I really like this product! It seems to do what it claims to do. I also have not had as many breakouts as I usually do.</li>
            <li> This product contain glycolic acid 20%. I&#x27;ve tried and it is just ok, it provide a light peeling and can be used combined with other treatments products.</li>
            <li> This product is well worth the investment. It brightens and smoothes my skin, and people have been telling me this summer how beautiful I look! They can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m 67! Yay!</li>
            <li> Not fully impressed. Thought my skin would look &amp; feel better. It is really only your average face pads. Thought my skin would have seen an improvement after at least 3 weeks. NOT!</li>
            <li> Its an amazing product.It gives a fantastic glow.I highly recommend it. Loves it!</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference after one use great</li>
            <li> Fine. Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> These are great pads normally but the ones that arrived were dingy yellow, packaging corroded and smelled differently than the normal ones.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these - they do sting a bit and don&#x27;t have the most pleasant odor but they make my skin feel so amazing and clean. I do feel a tightening feeling afterwards. However, I only left 3 stars as they absolutely do not last. I make sure they are sealed every time I use them but unfortunately when I had about a 1/4 of the pads left they began to get a yellowing around the edges and I threw them out. Mind you I use this product about every other day or every 3rd day so its not like they were sitting there un-used.</li>
            <li> I bought this at nordstroms not here but I just love this and can see a difference right away. I am 27 and just love it.</li>
            <li> This works great to keep your face looking fresh/dewy. Gets rid of all the dead skin and makes my skin feel great afterwards. Not sure about any wrinkle reduction but I do notice a big difference in the way my skin looks and feels when I forget to use it!</li>
            <li> Great, light product that goes a long way!  I stopped using this product, just ran out.. and forgot.. when I restarted using it, I made a decision that I will never stop again!  I can tell there&#x27;s an improvement in just a few weeks..I love PTR!!  This and the un-wrinkle pads make a great combo.. I recommend both HIGHLY!  Best way to buy this product is here on Amazon..I&#x27;ve shopped, no outdated product, and no shipping! Awesome!!</li>
            <li> This is my second jar. Really like this stuff. Smooths my skin and gives me a nice glow. I like to cut the pads in half so it lasts longer. A half of a pad is plenty. Also, I usually leave it on my skin for 5-60 minutes. I recommend!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these pads!  They leave my skin feeling super soft and it definitely looks better the next day.  I&#x27;ve only had the pads for a couple of weeks so I can&#x27;t say anything about the long term effects yet, but so far, so good.  My only complaint is that I have some clogged pores on my t-zone (I wouldn&#x27;t say acne, I guess they are whiteheads - just skin colored bumps) and I thought these would help clear it up, but they haven&#x27;t made a noticeable difference (at least not yet).  They work really well on fine lines and pores do look smaller and skin is so soft, I might upgrade them to a 5 star review in the next few weeks if I notice any help with the clogged pores.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month now. I purchased it to help with clogged pores (milia?) on my chin and to smooth out the overall rough texture, and I have 2 relatively deep wrinkles on my forehead. I noticed that within 3 or 4 uses the clogged pores improved and the little milia \\&quot;seeds\\&quot; would just push right out when I could NEVER get them to come out before, even after steaming. The pads are saturated, which is great because some pads dry out within a few weeks. This milia is all but gone, but regular clogged pores/blackheads aren&#x27;t really changing.  My skin feels soft and I&#x27;m not wearing foundation, only powder and a little concealer. No noticeable change with my forehead wrinkles yet but I don&#x27;t expect miracles. Be forewarned as other users have said you need to keep up with use. I went 3 or 4 days without using the pads and could see my pores were clogging and my skin began feeling rough.  The reason this is 3 stars is because since I have started using this product I have had 7 or 8 actual, full on pimples. Before using this I haven&#x27;t had any on my forehead in YEARS, and I got 2 within the first week. Then two at the bottom of my chin that were huge and hurt, which never happens. One or two on my nose, etc. Again, rare. Right now I have one at the edge of my upper lip which is really sexy, let me tell you. I will attribute this to the \\&quot;bad stuff\\&quot; being worked out and I will continue using the pads, since the benefits outweigh the concerns.    I would say these are a good introduction into chemical peels. I may upgrade to a stronger less frequent option next, but I started here because I&#x27;m pretty sensitive. It met 1 of 3 of what it says it will do, which is improved texture. If that is your goal I definitely recommend these pads!</li>
            <li> Great item.  I love these.</li>
            <li> really cleans the pores.. I&#x27;m not sure yet if it does anything else at this time for I have only used it for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful, I wipe the pad over my face, neck and top of hands and I feel it tingle while it works. It leaves my skin with an almost tacky, moisturized feeling. I don&#x27;t know how it works but the results are quick and beautiful.</li>
            <li> This product was clearly unsealed when it arrived.  No plastic seal around the outside as others have reported. The inner seal was very discolored and almost crumbling. When opened, the pads were dried looking and yellowed.  There&#x27;s no way I will try the pads, with no way of knowing how they may have been tampered with. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this pads after reading the other reviews.  I have to say that I actually think they might be helping.  It&#x27;s nothing major but it&#x27;s enough of a difference to keep me using them in the hopes that my wrinkles will improve... maybe it&#x27;s just me but I&#x27;m hopeful so I would definitely consider trying these.  I think if you are a bit younger it might work a lot better than it does for this older gal.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of this- it leaves a residue and the bottom line is that it doesn&#x27;t really work. I&#x27;ve used it for a month now and I&#x27;ve seen no difference in the short or long term. I have combination skin and I couldn&#x27;t see a difference in any area of my face.</li>
            <li> Love it! Does everything it says it would do. It&#x27;s  my go to in my skin care routine.</li>
            <li> INGREDIENTS LISTED HERE IS NOT COMPLETE LIST.  I like Peter Thomas Roth products as they seem to work well. But I am breastfeeding and was looking for products without dangerous chemicals in them.  According to the ingredients listed here- most are natural.  However when I received the product...there are two ingredients NOT LISTED ON AMAZON:  methylparaben and polyparaben, which are preservatives that can potentially cause disruptions to the hormonal system since they mimic estrogen in the body. I try to avoid parabens and peservatives in general.  I&#x27;m not going to use Peter Thomas Roth any more for the reason. They should eliminate preservatives in their products....I would gladly trade shelf life in for a safe product....I mean does this product really need to keep longer than one or two months??  Ridiculous.  We need to demand that the products we use not negatively impact our health.  Sure we might not notice immediate effects...but using all these chemicals over time... these products are slowly killing us.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a morning pick me up for their skin !</li>
            <li> About a month after I started using this product I noticed a huge differents in my skin especially in my t-zone area. It looked like my pores and small wrinkles disappeared on my face. I&#x27;ve purchased this product more than once on amazon and love it.</li>
            <li> Again love his products they do work.  Try his unwrinkled cream you would be amazed I am being very truthful I use and know.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so smooth, even toned, and luminescent! Gets rid of spots, acne scars and smoothes my skin. My pores smaller too! Can&#x27;t stop touching my face!!! :-)</li>
            <li> I am guilty of not using this more regularly, but when I do, I immediately notice results.  What I try to do is use this at least one time a week at night (I use a retinoid on the other nights). After washing, I use the peel pads which do sting a bit, rinse after about 2 min., and my face and top of neck immediately feels smoother, refreshed, and firm but not too tight.  The next day, I do not have any little fine breakouts and redness like I do on the non-peel days. (You think it would be the other way around!) Very happy with the product and will continue to use.  I am 38 and have rosacea. My skin looks fantastic for my age, if I do say so myself! ;) I believe SPF during the day &amp; topical antioxidants along with this PM combo are doing the trick.</li>
            <li> I am over fifty and have been through what seems like hundreds of facial products and my search has ended here.  I absolutely love these peel pads, just enough of a tingle to know they are working.  I have been using them for over a month and most definitely see a difference and my skin feels so much smoother.  I am placing a re-order right after typing this review.  I also found this to be the best price available, both online and in stores.  Try these, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It does what it promisses, but you have to be consistent with using it. I will buy again when the time comes.</li>
            <li> Only time will tell.  I  will need to review in a month or so to know if it is truly effective.</li>
            <li> Does nothing. Leave it on for an hour. Nothing. Is there a money back guarantee?</li>
            <li> Good product that does what it says.</li>
            <li> Everyone needs this products makes your skin smooth , firm, love it</li>
            <li> Only been using them for a few weeks now, only a couple of times a week since I have sensitive skin.  So far I really like them.  Broke out after first use an worried it might have been the cause, but since then no problems.  Tingles a little but my few brown spots are fading quickly and over all my skin looks and feels better.  Definitely will buy agin.</li>
            <li> These pads have improved my skin immensely. I had rough spots, whiteheads, dry patches, etc. After the first peel my skin felt smooth and much nicer. It evened out and corrected those annoying problems and my skin felt moisturized after! After reading some of the negative comments on here with regard to \\&quot;freshness\\&quot; of the product, I ordered them from Sephora because you can&#x27;t go wrong that route. It came sealed and completely fresh. Plus you get free samples and still get free shipping because the product alone will qualify. I&#x27;m a complete believer in this product. But buy it at sephora .com.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and effective.  My skin has been looking  tired this winter and after just two days of use, my face is glowing again.  I recommend using a good hydrating cream after each treatment to minimize dry patches.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for several weeks now.  Following the recommendation for my skin-type to only utilize them every other day or so... and I can really tell that the new skin is so much fresher and smoother than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have a ton of wrinkles to begin with, so I&#x27;m not sure whether or not there are improvements there.  My skin, however, is definitely soft, smooth, and feels great!</li>
            <li> It does leave my face feeling tighter(firmer?) and more radiant.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to be lessening the appearance of the wrinkles I still have there.  I&#x27;ll keep using it though.  Just not for the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Peter Thomas Roth Un-Wrinkle Peel Pads are as reliable as that old friend that you can always depend upon when your car breaks down or if you need a ride home from the bar.  This product has proven to consistently perform well, and I find that it leaves my skin firm, clear and supple.  My skin positively gleams after use and that always puts a twinkle in my eyes and a skip in my step.  I use it 3-5 times per week and have found it to be an excellent non-grainy exfoliator.  Although, I should point out that one should approach this product with ease and gradually work into your weekly use. I happen to have combination skin that can pretty much take a beating.  With that being said, on occasion when I apply these pads, I do feel a sensation of tingling, not quite stinging, but a buzzing of sorts that lets me know the product is absorbing.  So, caution to the beauties with  sensitive skin - slow go for you.  If you find that you can only use these pads 1-2 times per week, I still definitely consider it worth the effort.  If youâ€™re more on the rough and tumble side like I am, I recommend using these pads as often as time permits.  Your skin will thank you for it.  Iâ€™m a huge fan.</li>
            <li> I did not note less wrinkles, but can&#x27;t say I noted more wrinkles.  The pads are large and concentrated, so I found cutting the pads in half covers the face, neck and chest.</li>
            <li> DELIVERED JUST AS ADVERTISED!</li>
            <li> Product was not sealed so it&#x27;s smells funny and is not effective.</li>
            <li> A mild exfoliant to use in between stronger peels. Been on it for a couple of months. It also helps for better absorption of my skin creams.</li>
            <li> These are pretty good.  Easy to use.  Does not irritate sensitive skin.  Noticeable exfoliation and smoothing.  Worth a try.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product off Amazon initially as an impulse buy. I read something about “wrinkles” and had to have it. I’m glad my impulse buy has now produced a must have item and I’m a happy repeat buyer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m in my early 30s and have early signs of fine lines and wrinkles. I do not have large pores but I have some skin damage (yay, no sunscreen) from my twenties. I also had some uneven skin and discoloration that may have been caused by poor sunscreen use in my younger years. The uneven skin tone has improved since starting to use the pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is sensitive and these pads do not irritate my skin at all. I would not use this product daily but several times a week is fine. I’ve tapered off usage since my skin has improved so much. Now I’m in more of a maintenance mode. I’ve used philosophy’s exfoliant pads but experienced irritated skin. This product, I’m happy to report, does not cause irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cleanse my skin as usual and then use a single pad on my face, neck and around my eye area. I have no attempted using this product on the back of my hand until I read product reviews – thanks. I’ll be trying that next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wait a couple of minutes and then rinse my face off with lukewarm water. I usually have to apply moisturizer after use because my skin dries out quickly. It seems that my moisturizer soaks in better into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these pads because they’re easy to use and not messy. The process takes less than five minutes to complete but the rewards are awesome – I receive many compliments about my clean and clear skin.</li>
            <li> The unwrinkle peel pads is an item I&#x27;ve used for about two years. They help with fine lines, minimize pores &amp; exfoliate! They&#x27;ve also helped maintain breakouts; I love them!</li>
            <li> Seems to take out the fine lines and the blackheads. My skin looks great. And that is just after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Got a sample kit off another cosmetic site, and liked it. Ordered these pads and they are exactly what I paid full price for on the other site, but a lot cheaper. Will buy again, great packaging and fast ship. Works great on backs of hands also.</li>
            <li> I have tried many peel pads and these I find to be the best. Used with the PTR Un-Wrinkle night cream and you will see a  wonderful change in the texture and fine lines on your face. The pads are large enough to use on your face,neck, hands an chest area...I cut mine in half and still have enough product on the pads to cover the areas I mentioned. Start with clean skin, apply product on the peel pads onto your face and let it sit on your skin 2-5 minutes then rinse off and apply your favorite serum(mine is PTR) and then the Un-Wrinkle night cream. I saw a difference using these pads within days on my skin. I have oily skin and no break outs or burning at all. Love PTR products!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive fair skin with small broken capillaries so I&#x27;m reluctant to try new products. I was given a sample of 7 &amp; felt satisfied after the week. I decided to purchase the 60 count jar and commit to several months. As long as I don&#x27;t become red or break out, I&#x27;ll be happy. It seems to leave the skin looking and feeling fresh. One reviewer suggest cutting them in half but I recommend using the entire pad as it should be put on the neck &amp; chest areas as well. IF, any is left, use on the top of the hands which accrue much damage from the sun. Washing hands often takes the sunscreens off and leaves them exposed. I&#x27;m looking for a good hand cream SPF 30 with moisturizers &amp; does not wash off. Wish me luck on that one!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend trying a few pads before buying and see how your skin reacts to this product but I&#x27;m finding it gentle.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product and service. This is my second order. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I used this product in conjunction with the De Spot serum.  Definitely saw smoother, softer, more youthful skin...but didn&#x27;t seem to help with sun and post acne marks.  I felt the price was fair for the results I did see,  and the number of pads I got.</li>
            <li> These pads are great...and they work!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a month and have not noticed a difference. It is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now, but I have to say I was amazed and satisfied after the first use! I did not buy this product to use for wrinkles. I bought it to help minimize my pores. I didn&#x27;t actually think that was possible, but it is! I cannot say enough good about it! My skin is looking the best that it has looked in years! I look forward to trying out other products from this brand.</li>
            <li> I am a 54 year old male.  I started noticing the aging process so I thought I would try the product.  I must say it works well..  I use one pad a day and leave it on for 5 minutes.  As other say  my skin is smoother and pores are smaller.  It peeled a few years off.</li>
            <li> These pads are incredible.  I do not experience any tingling others speak of but my skin is firmer and definitely gives me a glow.  I was about to give the producted order from this company 3 stars but hate to do that to the product when I feel it was the company.  Normally when I have ordered from other sources, the pads are super moist but these came in almost dry.  Does anyone know a way to salvage these without requesting more and having the inconvenience of sending back?</li>
            <li> I bought these after seeing all of the glowing reviews, I will update my review when I am done with the product...but for now, they have a weird odor after you apply and a thicker residue. You do feel tingly from the acid working but I think they will do the job. I used to use Philosophy it&#x27;s a miracle retinoid pads but wanted to switch it up. So, hopefully this product will prove to be effective for the price. The jury is still out.</li>
            <li> These are not exfoliating as such (no crystals to abrade), however, using the pads morning and night for 30 days resulted in smoother, smaller pored complexion. I alternate by using these for a month, then switch to a dermabrasion type product for another 30 days.</li>
            <li> Love, love this product!! Makes my face soft, clean and bright!!</li>
            <li> Great product and price.</li>
            <li> good product, it can remove the head skin but not for sensitive skin. I only use on the T-zone and neck.</li>
            <li> I had an allergic reaction to this product. I have very sensitive skin and broke out in hives. Returned for credit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late twenties, and hate that my skin isn&#x27;t what it used to be. I spent countless hours outdoors with no sun protection which earned me a good amount of freckles and sun spots. Since regretting it won&#x27;t help my skin any, I decided to try PTR pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tiny pores and smooth skin already.. it&#x27;s just the discoloration I really want to change. I left this on for about 15-20 minutes. It didn&#x27;t burn but when I exhaled out of my nose, my breath felt hot. My skin feels even smoother and I swear my spots are starting to diminish. As far as wrinkles.. I think I&#x27;ll need more time to really tell if there&#x27;s a difference&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I go through 1-2 pads each time so I know I&#x27;m going to have to re-up on these in a few weeks!</li>
            <li> I used to buy philosophy&#x27;s brightening peel pads at $65 for 12. Using those once a week, I figured it was worth the money. Plus, I was cutting them in half. After awhile, I just couldn&#x27;t stomach the price so I stopped buying them. When I was given a sample of the Peter Roth c30 citrus, I fell in love. I immediately bought a bottle. At that time, I noticed these and decided I&#x27;d try them. Oooo! What a bargain for what they do. My skin felt so soft and clean after using it one time. I use these once every two or three days now. They really help to exfoliate and smooth my skin. I follow up with my moisturizer or c30 serum, and my skin just glows. Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Great product. I use it almost every day and have seen dramatic results in fine lines on forehead, reduced blackheads and overall skin brightness. I cut the pads in half (making a 60 count a 120 count this lasting twice as long) and it&#x27;s enough to do my whole face and neck</li>
            <li> I love these peel pads. They made my pores so much smaller. Made my foundation go on much smoother! I use them once a day and I feel like I get this glow I used to get when I would get a facial done at the spa.</li>
            <li> I like it and will continue buying it.  It works well.</li>
            <li> Completely changed my skin.  Not as an exfoliator, but almost more like a peel you wipe on and quickly rinse from your face.  My face feels like a baby&#x27;s bottom after about a week of using this product.  It&#x27;s expensive, but cheaper to buy it on Amazon than in the stores.  I&#x27;m 42, I don&#x27;t smoke and I&#x27;m in the early stages of wrinkles and dullness.  I can&#x27;t say enough about this stuff.  It&#x27;s a game changer for the aging process!</li>
            <li> So far I really like this product. Have used Philosophy for awhile but this seems a bit more diverse and is doing a good job on blemishes and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> this product is very good for cleaning the skin, especially if you do not have time to go for a facial</li>
            <li> Moisturize well after use on your face, especially if you have dry skin.  Noticed a difference on the back of my hands.</li>
            <li> Ahhhhhh, these pads make my skin feel soooooooooooo wonderful. I just started using them yesterday so I can&#x27;t tell you how effective they are as undoing wrinkles, but am very optimistic these will stay a keeper in my facial cleansing routine because they just feel so good on the skin, unbelievably good, I Love these pads!</li>
            <li> I have no idea if it a great product or not. I use it just once a week for a little more exfoliation.</li>
            <li> These pads work miracles! Smoother, younger looking skin after just a few applications. Just love them!</li>
            <li> I heard and read great things about these pads.  Just about a month since I started using them and not seeing any real improvements yet.  I will keep trying.</li>
            <li> I am a skin care junkie and PTR has really great products and these simply make any of their other products 10 times more effective.  Skin tingles a bit in a good way and glows for hours afterwards.  I use this with the I wrinkle serum and find my skin to be the softest it has ever been.  Only using for a short time so as far as wrinkles I will report again soon.  As far as texture my skin has never looked better. LUMUNIOUS!</li>
            <li> 29 yrs young; Oily Skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: I have been using this for a month and have not seen a difference. I then started using it twice because of my oily skin and still NOTHING. I&#x27;ve also noticed more acne on my skin, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: I cut the pads into halves and fourths because they are very saturated. Not only will this save stretch your usage but the excess saturation leaves your face moisturized without applying any additional facial lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may be a good \\&quot;starter\\&quot; peel but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> I cut these in half and they last longer.  I have noticed the difference.</li>
            <li> I think they work well, but I didn&#x27;t realize that it was a peel. I thought that I could just keep them bedside and use them to clean my face when I wanted. With these, you have to time them and then rinse them off - like any peel. I just thought they were different. That being said. I really like them. I have combination, and sensitive skin and these worked really well. Left my skin glowing after the first use!</li>
            <li> these pads really work; i have fibromyalgia and don&#x27;t have much energy to do anything; these are easy to use and really can feel them working; they make my skin look more radiant and clear and smooth; will use them the rest of my life</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too harsh and it removes the dead skin cells. Leaves your skin feeling refreshed. Depending on your skin type you should make a judgement how often to use it.</li>
            <li> Great but expensive for just removing any facial makeup or grime. Like shiny healthy look after using. Don&#x27;t notice any change with skin condition, pores or wrinkles, although tried a 2nd order.</li>
            <li> First of all, I would like to say that I love this product and I have been using it for a while.  The sad part is that I decided to buy here and I&#x27;m not sure if I have the actual product.  The product was not sealed in the container.... and the pads and product smelled differently than before.  It also feels different on my face.  I buy on Amazon a few times a month and this is my first review.</li>
            <li> I have been battling with acne for going on 8 years now.  The only thing I have found that dramatically improves the condition of my skin is chemical peels from an esthetician.  That cost about $500 for a package of 3 ( get the strongest available), she uses PCA which I love .  However I just can&#x27;t pay that much money 4 times a year, as is needed to keep my skin clear.  I decided to try this product in combination with the Unwrinkle Peel Gel and I am blown away at the results.  My skin looks amazing, so clear and bright!  My makeup goes on so smooth and the blemishes I do have, which are under the surface, are getting smaller and smaller every day.  With cystic acne it is difficult to find products strong enough to penetrate that deep, this does it!  I use it at night and instead of rinsing, just go to bed. If i feel like my skin can handle it I use another pad after the first one dries. Then in the morning use the Peel gel about 3-4 times a week. I also alternate putting a thick coat of silica acid gel and benzoic peroxide cream on after the morning peel gel. Just a cheap maximum strength one from target, they are all the same.  No moisturizer! (definitely drying but it is clearing up!)  This has been my routine for about 2 weeks now and I can tell a dramatic difference.  Keep in mind my skin is really tough.  I have ethnic olive complexion  with lots of oil and dead skin, i&#x27;m native american.  This is perfect for Asian or other ethnic cystic acne prone skin types!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck!</li>
            <li> These are the best peel pads out there! My skin looks bright, smooth and renewed. This is an awesome product!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin look great!</li>
            <li> Helped clear my skin. I used it a couple times a week.</li>
            <li> I used these pads regularly and noticed smaller pores but no improvement in dark spots. I will keep using an acid solution that I apply myself rather than branded pads.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin. This product works miracles. You will notice immediate results. It makes my skin look smooth and radiant at 67.&lt;br /&gt;Sold on his peeling gel firm exfoliant also. Watch the skin slough off. I have not tried all his product yet but these two are wonderful. You cannot go wrong. I think no matter what kind of skin you have You will notice the difference.</li>
            <li> These are the first peel pads I have had; I have also not had a professional peel either.  I am satisfied with my purchase, you really CAN feel a difference after the first application.  Your skin feels amazing, baby smooth.  The pads have appropriately saturated and can even be cut in half as some other reviewers have suggested.  I have not been using them long (about two weeks), so I can&#x27;t comment on the wrinkle reducing power, but they really do wonders for softening skin and making it more luminescent.  I can&#x27;t wait to see the continuing results as I use them more often - hopefully they help soften the smile lines around my eyes and the worry lines on my forehead. I have normal skin, but it tends to be a little sensitive to strong products.  I have not had any problem with irritation or dryness and I use them about every other day, although I could probably use them daily with no problem.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first when I ordered this product. I have sensitive skin and most products dry out my skin. After the first use, my face was smooth, soft and gleaming! I am so happy with this purchase. I am in my mid-20s and have acne scars. I am on acne medication and use other topical ointments. I thought trying out a peel will decrease the appearance of the redness of acne scars. After a few days of use I was already seeing results! This is incredible stuff!</li>
            <li> a good facial cleanser I didnt feel any tingle or saw any difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I use this every morning. I have sensitive skin, and this doesn&#x27;t cause any problems at all. It seems to make pores smaller and even out skin tone. I have been using it about a year.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully. Does not irritate my skin and leave it feeling smooth, bright and refreshed. Love this product.</li>
            <li> This product made me break out, horribly. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin so this was very unexpected, especially after all the good reviews. Do not buy!!!</li>
            <li> its mild on skin. I will definitely buy again. Still waiting to see results on fine lines but skin feels soft and fresh after using.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good and I like this product.  The only reason this did not receive 5stars is that it&#x27;s overly harsh on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It took too much off my cheeks and ended up getting red splotches all over my right side of the face.&lt;br /&gt;Especially bad with humid or hot weather, I found.&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I came back to the desert air (aka, western US) the redness went away.</li>
            <li> These pads really do a good job of removing flakiness, and making my skin look clean and bright.  The pads are moist, and there is enough to do my face, neck, chest, and back of hands.  Then whatever is left I do my feet.  Sometimes I feel a slight sting when first applied, but that dosen&#x27;t last.  I&#x27;ve used other pads similar to these, and I think these have best ingredients, and perform better.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working . Skin seems smoother. It has alot&lt;br /&gt;Of natural ingredients and a good combination of peel&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients to cover a multitude of skin conditions.</li>
            <li> Made my skin feel dry and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> love this stuff it works yes you have to use it ...way better than any kind of surgery def recommend</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me as it did for others.I was very dissapointed and will not be buying it again</li>
            <li> Love these pads...easy, quick and effective!</li>
            <li> Amazon did a great job on responding to complaint. Tracking showed that it was delivered to my door but i never received it. But I emailed amazon and they were able to mail me another one right away.&lt;br /&gt;OK, now about the product! This is the second jar I&#x27;ve ordered. I stopped using it for about 1 month thinking that it didn&#x27;t do much to my skin since i didn&#x27;t notice the difference but i noticed the difference when i STOPPED using it. It did lighten up my dark spots. They are still noticeable but it is lighter. My skin my more even and it looks more supple.  I recommend this product. I wouldn&#x27;t dare stop using it. It says to leave it on for 30 seconds to 2 mins. The 1st week i left it on for 1 min because i was afraid that my sensitive skin will be irritated. BUT I accidentally left it on for 5 mins 1 night because I was distracted by something on TV (reality show) and i really noticed the difference!</li>
            <li> My pores get easily clogged and I use this every other day. It&#x27;s helped keeping my pores clear. It&#x27;s easy to use and it&#x27;s better than scrubs. It has really helped my skin from breaking out. I highly recommend this.</li>
