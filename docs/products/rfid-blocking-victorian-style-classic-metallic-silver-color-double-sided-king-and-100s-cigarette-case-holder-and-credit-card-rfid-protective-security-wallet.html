            <li>Love Love Love this case!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t smoke and I wanted a safe wallet to carry on me that would be metal</li>
            <li>They love it.</li>
            <li>I love this case ...</li>
            <li>I just have to make sure it locks..</li>
            <li>It scratches relatively easily</li>
            <li>I think its pretty nice, 10/10 would bang.</li>
            <li>The design is different on each side &amp; both are so shiney &amp; beautiful.</li>
            <li>Perfectly fine case, it fits in my pockets when packed with papers, a lighter, and a couple cigs.</li>
            <li>Great if not using in back pocket!</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t fill up both sides with cigarettes, you can fit a bic lighter in there too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use this product as my primary wallet.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This item is cheap.</li>
            <li>Thanks AMAZON!!</li>
            <li>It does a great job of holding cigarettes, and it looks a little bit more classy than just a pack of cigarettes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also relatively slim and a nice, shiny color.</li>
            <li>Could do with a more powerful opening spring, overall not a bad case.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made but sturdy and the button to open, clip and spring work just fine.  </li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>With some tender love and care, this can last quite a lot.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s made out of a thin stainless steel, so it&#x27;s lightweight and looks great.</li>
            <li>Holds a whole pack of cigarettes.</li>
            <li>Saves a whole lot of room in my handbag.</li>
            <li>enjoy the larger size, clips, functionality.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;Scott</li>
            <li>Way too big to fit cc for a wallet</li>
            <li>My wife really like the case.</li>
            <li>Much better then the other ones you see.</li>
            <li>but the little clamp the keeps the case locked does not work any more</li>
            <li>I have had it for a couple months &amp; it still looks brand new</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little bit easy to pinch your fingers on this, but after a while I got used to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The design is conventional and humble, good for any occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fits</li>
            <li>Works and has lasted for a while so far, 6 months.</li>
            <li>It works well enough, it can bend easily around the area it closes and the hinge can mess up from it,</li>

            <li> High quality fits 20 100 cigs and closes tight  with no spills in pocket</li>
            <li> it works, but I wanted it for a credit card case, like one had before, and it is simply too big for that.</li>
            <li> Holds a whole pack of cigarettes. I was sick of my cigarettes getting crushed, so I bought this and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Its a shiny metal hinged (spring powered opening) box that fits 20 100mm cigarettes. I&#x27;ve had it a month now, still works perfectly</li>
            <li> Excellent case for the money. Looks good,  the spring inside works good, and a very attractive looking case. All for a great price.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a wallet. It is to soft, had in back pocket, sat down &amp; hinges broke. Great if not using in back pocket!</li>
            <li> Could do with a more powerful opening spring, overall not a bad case. I think its pretty nice, 10/10 would bang.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t smoke and I wanted a safe wallet to carry on me that would be metal so no one could get my credit info. I have given this as a gift and I bought one for myself and I love it!</li>
            <li> Cheaply made but sturdy and the button to open, clip and spring work just fine.  The design is conventional and humble, good for any occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fits both 100s and kings.  If you don&#x27;t fill up both sides with cigarettes, you can fit a bic lighter in there too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it as a wallet on one side and put cigarettes on the other.  Saves a whole lot of room in my handbag.</li>
            <li> This is a great, lightweight cigarette holder. It has two arms on the inside, which both hold the cigarettes and help the case to spring open a bit, too. It does a great job of holding cigarettes, and it looks a little bit more classy than just a pack of cigarettes. The design on this is great. It has different patterns on the front and on the back, and it comes in different designs. I&#x27;m reviewing the Diamond L, for 100 size cigarettes. It&#x27;s a little bit longer, but this also comes in the regular size, too. It&#x27;s a little bit easy to pinch your fingers on this, but after a while I got used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s made out of a thin stainless steel, so it&#x27;s lightweight and looks great. I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*NeverXhale gave me this case to review*</li>
            <li> Got this for a gift. They love it. Holds 18-20 smokes. Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It works well enough, it can bend easily around the area it closes and the hinge can mess up from it, but otherwise it&#x27;s crush-proof.</li>
            <li> Perfectly fine case, it fits in my pockets when packed with papers, a lighter, and a couple cigs.</li>
            <li> Well EOnSale. Has done a wonderful job by replacing my item as promised !!  I  will continue to shop with them in the future.&lt;br /&gt;  Olivia</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this case! The design is different on each side &amp; both are so shiney &amp; beautiful. I have had it for a couple months &amp; it still looks brand new &amp; I use it everyday. I smoke 20+ smokes aday too. I give it 5 stars &amp; would buy it again without a doubt! Thanks AMAZON!!</li>
