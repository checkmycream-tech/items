            <li>very good product....</li>
            <li>This product is really great for my t-zone break outs.</li>

            <li>Good for cleaning your skin</li>
            <li>Now I was getting about 2 or more a week!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser.</li>
            <li>Love the way my face looks and feels after using.&lt;br /&gt;Also...</li>
            <li>Love the way this creases my face</li>
            <li>and this is seeming to help keep it clear and beautiful.</li>
            <li>This has a lovely fragrance (very fresh and clean).</li>
            <li>This is a great product just like so many of their other products.</li>
            <li>Being older, this is very important to me.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>It not only smells amazing, but it cleans my skin gently and effectively unlike any other product.</li>
            <li>Just used first time.</li>
            <li>Definitely one of my favorite cleansers.</li>
            <li>My ultimate favorite product from this line would be their vitamin E face cream.</li>
            <li>I was introduced to this when I had a facial - of course paid much more for it then.  </li>
            <li>The second day of use a woman stopped me to tell me how lovely my skin is.</li>
            <li>This is moisturizing and easily gets eye makeup off which is a double bonus.</li>
            <li>When i began using this I began to get huge red pimples under my skin!</li>
            <li>but I know it gave me red, itchy, huge bumps</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I have been using it for few years now and would recommend it to a friend for sure.</li>
            <li>I used this for 2 months hoping my skin was just getting used to the new wash</li>
            <li>and my skin is now clear again!</li>
            <li>It has taken me a long time to find the right cleanser</li>
            <li>I have clear skin but wanted to change my cleanse to something natural!</li>
            <li>My skin had been %100 clear of ALL impurities for over 3 months when I decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin and tend to break out with harsher products.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this wash for a few days now, but I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Love the way this cleans my face although I was skeptical at first since I have combination and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to any one who has combination skin or the occasional break outs.</li>
            <li>It minimizes pores and deep cleans without stripping skin of natural moisture.</li>
            <li>this works well to take off makeup and dirt and not dry out my skin.</li>

            <li> Only a 3 because just got it yesterday!! Heard good things is why I purchased. Hope I like it. Just used first time. Only use a tad, will make face burn if use a lot. Just from first use, said to use a small amount on package..</li>
            <li> very good product....I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> It washes away all the dirt and oil from the face. Leaves my face fresh and clean. I have been using it for few years now and would recommend it to a friend for sure.</li>
            <li> This is a great product just like so many of their other products. This is moisturizing and easily gets eye makeup off which is a double bonus. Definitely one of my favorite cleansers. My ultimate favorite product from this line would be their vitamin E face cream. Best I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
            <li> I have clear skin but wanted to change my cleanse to something natural! My skin had been %100 clear of ALL impurities for over 3 months when I decided to give this a try. When i began using this I began to get huge red pimples under my skin! Something i used to get like once a year if any! Now I was getting about 2 or more a week! This also made my skin scar prone. Even the tiniest bump would leave a red mark after it went away! Without ever popping a single pimple! I used this for 2 months hoping my skin was just getting used to the new wash but NO! After my skin was horrible i finnaly went back to my old cleanser and the bumps all began to go away and my skin is now clear again! I don&#x27;t know what the problem was but I know it gave me red, itchy, huge bumps I had never had! I do not recommend this!!</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this when I had a facial - of course paid much more for it then.  Love the way this cleans my face although I was skeptical at first since I have combination and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser. It deep cleanses without being harsh. It minimizes pores and deep cleans without stripping skin of natural moisture. Being older, this is very important to me. I also have sensitive skin and tend to break out with harsher products. Love the way my face looks and feels after using.&lt;br /&gt;Also...This has a lovely fragrance (very fresh and clean). I have noticed a great improvement in my skin tone and texture since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> Love the way this creases my face</li>
            <li> Good for cleaning your skin but I cannot use it every day because it is too harsh.  It could smell a little prettier too.</li>
            <li> It has taken me a long time to find the right cleanser and this is the one! I have combo skin and this works well to take off makeup and dirt and not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Best products on the market!</li>
            <li> This is the best formula, I have ever used as a cleanser. Makes for glow and look younger too! Will buy, again! AAA++ Fast-Shipping too!! (edit)&lt;br /&gt;0 comments</li>
            <li> I have only been using this wash for a few days now, but I absolutely love it. It not only smells amazing, but it cleans my skin gently and effectively unlike any other product. I have oily skin that loves to get irritated and broken out and this is seeming to help keep it clear and beautiful. The second day of use a woman stopped me to tell me how lovely my skin is. I would have to recommend this to ANYONE with skin even similar to mine.</li>
            <li> Love it!  This is a great cleanser,  and I use it twice a day. It was recommended by my estitician.</li>
