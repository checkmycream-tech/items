            <li>Luckily they liked the one that was shipped.</li>
            <li>The smell is not as strong....</li>

            <li>FAST DELIVERY LOVE MY MERCHANDISE.  </li>
            <li>I am very picky about what she wears because so many smell like bug-spray to me.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>This scent is powerful (it last for hours and hours to come) and so sexy!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Love to layer for ultimate luxuriously clean fresh feeling and scent.</li>
            <li>Very loud &amp; cheap smelling fragrance, did not like this item.</li>
            <li>I bought 3 bottles in Dec for $8 (no shipping) which is what I paid at BBW when I first tried it</li>
            <li>I love this product such that I cant even express myself.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is remarkable and long lasting definitely worth the money</li>
            <li>Fragrance is different from most of the fragrances in B&amp;BW.</li>
            <li>I put this perfume on in the early afternoon and 8 hours later, I can still smell it on me which is impressive considering all of my other perfumes last 2-3 hours at most.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;ve heard it has been discontinued which really bums me out.</li>
            <li>Thank you for the fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>and I believe anyone should consider buying this product if they really want something very good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really wanted to try this product Midnight Forever.</li>
            <li>When I received this scent the first thing that came to my head was wow!</li>
            <li>showed up early and exactly as description stated</li>
            <li>Fragrance seemed more watered down than my wife and I are accustomed</li>
            <li>2 for less than the price of one :)</li>
            <li>This is a terrific scent that is deep &amp; sexy &amp; far from smelling like a flower.</li>
            <li>I just love this fragrance because it not strong....</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t sell new anymore</li>
            <li>I felt the item was definitely reasonably priced but when I ordered 2 at the same time I had to pay 2 shipping fees of $5, which doesn&#x27;t make sense.</li>
            <li>I  recommend to anyone that wants to be the center of attention when they walk in the room.</li>
            <li>It is soft, delicate and very feminine.&lt;br</li>

            <li> It is soft, delicate and very feminine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a real soft scent and its something you can wear everyday</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m hoping it will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> The only negative issue is that the scent does not last as long as the more expensive brands such as Hypnose by Lancôme.</li>
            <li> it was just what I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite-smelling perfume, but unfortunately the smell doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this scent on Amazon because I believed that in the store it just was a little overpriced</li>
            <li> Some of the perfume was wasted because of that.</li>
            <li> cuz bath and body works don&#x27;t make them no more .&lt;br</li>
            <li> Crazy what demand does to the cost of a product, hoping it also drives it Back Into The Store!</li>
            <li> And in a bath abd body store a bottle like this is at least 30 bucks</li>
            <li> unfortunately</li>
            <li> I received the wrong perfume.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, I can not rate this product.  </li>
            <li> too bad Bath and Body discontinued this product in the store.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Love this Body Spray. Smells really good layered on under the perfume. I Love It!</li>
            <li> fast shipping and awesome scent!</li>
            <li> Just received this today and I love it! Although I&#x27;ve heard it has been discontinued which really bums me out. But it&#x27;s a generous sized bottle so I&#x27;m hoping it will last me a long time. I put this perfume on in the early afternoon and 8 hours later, I can still smell it on me which is impressive considering all of my other perfumes last 2-3 hours at most.</li>
            <li> Heavenly scent. Just lovely</li>
            <li> The perfume bottle had a crack on the top of it and leaked all inside the package. Some of the perfume was wasted because of that.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this Bath and Body Works purfume more then 5 stars. The smell is excellent, it last throughout the whole day. My friends are always sniffing me, and plus the compliments I get are amazing ! If I were you I&#x27;de buy this purfume.</li>
            <li> FAST DELIVERY LOVE MY MERCHANDISE.  LOOK FORWARD TO DOING BUSINESS WITH YOU AGAIN.  LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> seems though i ended keeping this and very glad i did i love the smell and so does my husband thank you seller  &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> This is a signature scent of mine and I was so upset when Bath &amp; Body Works discontinued it. I wear it almost every day and still get compliments all the time! I felt the item was definitely reasonably priced but when I ordered 2 at the same time I had to pay 2 shipping fees of $5, which doesn&#x27;t make sense. Besides that I got it quickly in perfect condition and I&#x27;m happy to have 2 bottles for backup!</li>
            <li> Thank you for the replacement.. Excellent</li>
            <li> Product was as described! Love it!</li>
            <li> Very good for my girlfriend</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance. Why can&#x27;t it be purchased at Bath and Body?</li>
            <li> Thank you for the fast shipping.  I am so glad I got a great deal on 2 of these.  2 for less than the price of one :)&lt;br /&gt;Thank you again!</li>
            <li> I took a big gamble and bought this not knowing what the scent was like-- the wife asked for it for her b-day.  I am very picky about what she wears because so many smell like bug-spray to me.  I must say we are both extremely happy with this and highly recommend this for your lovely lady</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite-smelling perfume, but unfortunately the smell doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> The smell is not as strong....unfortunately</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance but am happy I have others I like too. I bought 3 bottles in Dec for $8 (no shipping) which is what I paid at BBW when I first tried it, now it&#x27;s going for $30 ea total. Crazy what demand does to the cost of a product, hoping it also drives it Back Into The Store!</li>
            <li> Love this my favorite I didn&#x27;t think it was going to be so big but im glad</li>

            <li> What a Fresh smell  !!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing! I decided to buy this scent on Amazon because I believed that in the store it just was a little overpriced and I am so glad I could find it on amazon. When I received this scent the first thing that came to my head was wow! it&#x27;s just worth every penny. This scent is powerful (it last for hours and hours to come) and so sexy! I got so many compliments on it, and I saw lots of heads turning. I  recommend to anyone that wants to be the center of attention when they walk in the room. Amazing!</li>
            <li> OK - this stuff is AWESOME!!! and it doesn&#x27;t sell new anymore so stock up - I&#x27;ll be buying more too while it&#x27;s available!</li>
            <li> great product. I love this product such that I cant even express myself. you are doing a good job selling good product. It is good for me and I believe anyone should consider buying this product if they really want something very good.&lt;br /&gt;I am thinking about buying a second one. yours is exceptional!</li>
            <li> Bath and body works quit selling this product which is one of my favorite so when I found it on Amazon I was so thrilled smells really good and came quickly with prime</li>
            <li> Everything was great and sent in a timely matter.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance !!!!!i just ordered another one.....</li>
            <li> The fragrance is remarkable and long lasting definitely worth the money its affordable and it will turn many heads a true must have</li>
            <li> Very loud &amp; cheap smelling fragrance, did not like this item.</li>
            <li> got it on time TODAY love it wished I would of got the body wash I absolutely LOVE this scent if you love perfume cologne body sprays this is a must</li>
            <li> Great smell...too bad Bath and Body discontinued this product in the store.</li>
            <li> I love it!! Fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> is for my mother in law she loves this stuff</li>
            <li> I received the wrong perfume.  I gave it anyway and they were happy but I was not!  Luckily they liked the one that was shipped.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite Bath &amp; Body Works fragrances.  I will definitely purchase it again, GREAT PRICE!!! Thank you...</li>
            <li> I love it it was just what I expected. The shipping time was awsome. Will order again.</li>
            <li> My grandaughter loves it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume!  I wear it to work and after work on the weekends.  Love it!  I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific scent that is deep &amp; sexy &amp; far from smelling like a flower. I loved it the first time it came out from Bath &amp; Body. This scent does not come on too strong. The only negative issue is that the scent does not last as long as the more expensive brands such as Hypnose by Lancôme. However, the price is a great factor in affordability &amp; the bottle is plastic &amp; handy &amp; will not break. I had to order online because I could not find  a B &amp; B close to me who carried it anymore.  Warning:  If you wear it to bed, don&#x27;t plan on getting any sleep if your husband is there....Yummy.....</li>
            <li> I love this bath and body works scent, I bought the perfume and I just had to have the mist spray to go along. :)</li>
            <li> Sorry, I can not rate this product.  I did not receive it. I really wanted to try this product Midnight Forever.</li>
            <li> I like this fragrance. It is soft, delicate and very feminine.&lt;br /&gt;Me gusta esta fragancia. Es suave, delicada y muy femenina.</li>
            <li> I like the initial smell of this perfume.  It smells powerful and sexy. When it dries the smell of vanilla is prominent.  I am not a big fan of vanilla but it works.</li>
            <li> Fragrance seemed more watered down than my wife and I are accustomed</li>
            <li> You get more than what you pay for in this bottle.  It smells amazing! !! And in a bath abd body store a bottle like this is at least 30 bucks</li>
            <li> showed up early and exactly as description stated</li>
            <li> Thank you so much !!! I received my order in 3 days . They are very good , i am working for bath and body works i could not find this product at all ,  cuz bath and body works don&#x27;t make them no more .&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you so much guys !!!!</li>
            <li> Love to layer for ultimate luxuriously clean fresh feeling and scent.</li>
            <li> I love Midnight forever smell so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten lots of complements wearing this scent.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance at a great price. Way cheaper than the price in B&amp;BW. Fragrance is different from most of the fragrances in B&amp;BW. The order arrived on time and in good condition. Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I hope that BBW brings this back! It is awesome, I love it. Now if I can just find the 3 wick candle with the same scent! Thank you for your prompt delivery!</li>
