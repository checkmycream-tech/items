            <li>Best makeup ever.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t look like I was wearing makeup, it just looked like I had naturally perfect skin.</li>
            <li>This is the best foundation I have found for my oily, acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li>and this is just the best for my skin.</li>
            <li>This is a great product line to get stuck on!</li>
            <li>This is a very good product.  </li>
            <li>Great coverage, and wears all day.</li>
            <li>But then I saw pictures of myself out with friends wearing bareminerals foundation, bareminerals well rested, and finishing powder over it, and my skin looked great.  </li>
            <li>This product is great, I&#x27;ve been using it for years</li>
            <li>Always happy w/it.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Goes on great.  </li>
            <li>Also, I love to mix my bareminerals foundations anyway to get the perfect color</li>
            <li>And best part is its so easy to use and</li>
            <li>Good stuff.  </li>
            <li>Always loved bareMinerals.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product along with a good finishing powder like mineral veil</li>
            <li>Otherwise, you&#x27;re good all day.  </li>
            <li>Good coverage without looking like makeup</li>
            <li>so purchased the fair makeup &amp; brush.  </li>
            <li>Great product at better price.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great because it is readily available and you always know what you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li>I see no improvement of any kind</li>
            <li>So typically, it&#x27;s good for good-skin days, but on not-so-good-skin-days, I stick with more of a fuller-coverage foundation.</li>
            <li>and my face looked liked</li>
            <li>I love this product and I love that I could get it for this price with Amazon Prime!</li>
            <li>This is THE most amazing make-up ever.</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely and can be layered for more coverage.  </li>
            <li>I love this make up, it is very light weight.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I can actually wear this and it feels amazing!!!</li>
            <li>I love this foundation, as nothing was working correctly for me.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been using it for years and have never been satisfied with another foundation product.</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t found anything I like more.</li>
            <li>:) Bonus, it&#x27;s waaay cheaper here on Amazon</li>
            <li>love it.  </li>
            <li>Now, this shouldn&#x27;t be worn with too greasy an spf moisturizer, though, or it will need touching up.</li>
            <li>I got my color matched in the store, and have since bought from Amazon when I need more.  </li>
            <li>The matte is 100% better.  </li>
            <li>It has a great matte finish and looks great almost all day with minimal touch-ups required!</li>
            <li>I put the bareMinerals on in the morning and am good to go through most days (barring extremely hot, humid weather).  </li>
            <li>As usual, a flawless application and my skin has never looked better!</li>
            <li>So far I am happy and will continue to use this.</li>
            <li>This matte product covers more effectively than other iterations of their foundation, in my experience, so you can use it as concealer too, and this shade I lighter than the lightest of their bisque products, so it works better for us fair skinned types.  </li>
            <li>I am a fan of Bare Minerals and this is just one of their great products.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want it to be true, but this covers so much better than the Avon version.  </li>
            <li>It leaves me a bit shinier than I prefer to look, and the shine tends to highlight the fine lines on my eyelids.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite foundation!</li>
            <li>It has pretty good staying power, which is the biggest problem with mineral makeups to me, but I just spray my face with a light mist of water after applying and that seems to set it pretty well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the lightest, but not as light as physicians formula matte in translucent (my budget brand)</li>
            <li>My wife says it&#x27;s a great product and gives sheer coverage.</li>
            <li>Goes on like light powder.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a much better product, it covers better and lasts much longer.</li>
            <li>The coverage isn&#x27;t as good as the original bare minerals foundation.</li>
            <li>After watching commercials, was excited to try this makeup and brush.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super light on my face</li>
            <li>(although I just use elf finishing powder, just as good and only about $5 for a huge container).</li>
            <li>The only thing I think Loreal&#x27;s product is better is the brush comes with the product as a top, it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have extremely fair skin, with a lot of red in it, so I bought this foundation just to even out</li>
            <li>If you do too many layers, it starts to look cake-y, and nobody wants that.</li>
            <li>I am in my late 40&#x27;s, with very fair, reddish skin (rosacea).</li>
            <li>The Primer really helps the foundation to go on smoothly and to provide the coverage that you want.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and is much more natural looking than liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>it is also much better for me in the summer with my oily skin which is also sensitive and prone to rosacea.</li>
            <li>It looks natural and feels really light and clean.</li>
            <li>I love bare minerals.</li>
            <li>I ordered the fair shade but it&#x27;s still too dark for me.</li>
            <li>It goes on so easily and makes my skin look fresh and smooth rather than chalky as I&#x27;ve found some other mineral makeups do.</li>
            <li>It evens out my complexion while somehow still magically showing the freckles on my face, which I like, although I have tested before and it is possible to completely erase my freckles by using a firmer foundation brush to smooth it on a bit heavier.  </li>
            <li>I use a primer first  </li>
            <li>My first time trying bareMinerals.</li>
            <li>I tend to go for higher end/&amp;#34;pure&amp;#34;/organic stuff</li>
            <li>Stays on in the hot Florida weather.  </li>
            <li>I use Jane Iredale&#x27;s tinted moisturizer underneath it and love the way it looks, plus I feel like it makes it last a lot longer throughout the day and look that much smoother</li>
            <li>I love how natural it looks and how it magically erases the occasional blemish or red blotch on my face.  </li>
            <li>so make sure you moisturize beforehand if your skin is on the dry side</li>
            <li>I used to use the original Bare Minerals, it covered well</li>
            <li>It really does not work for me at all.</li>
            <li>When I saw this come up in my amazon &amp;#34;suggestions,&amp;#34; I couldn&#x27;t resist saying something because I was just thinking how much I dislike this foundation this morning.</li>
            <li>This is my first mineral foundation, normally I stick to my Revlon liquid foundation, but I decided to give something lighter a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tries so many kinds of minerals</li>
            <li>I have been an avid user of BareMinerals Foundation for the past 5 years and can honestly say that I don&#x27;t plan on changing that any time soon.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I love BareMinerals</li>
            <li>The coverage is good but so subtle.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle in my highly reactive skin, works for my skin tone (fairest), and doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s usually just starting to fade a bit, which is pretty good in my book.  </li>
            <li>The price is better on Amazon than in the store, and you don&#x27;t have to deal with people trying to sell you a thousand other products you don&#x27;t need!</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and sealed properly.</li>
            <li>I have used the original for so long</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this makeup for those with acne-prone skin and oily/combo skin.</li>
            <li>I was wary of powder, but this is great.</li>
            <li>When I saw this product I thought it would be great since it&#x27;s for oily skin, but I was wrong....</li>
            <li>I did order it in the exact same color and it does look a tiny bit darker, but I think that it actually matches my skin tone better.  </li>
            <li>have oily combination skin- and very sensitive.</li>
            <li>Never have I had a liquid concealer work nearly as well as this stuff!  </li>
            <li>This was exactly the same product that I&#x27;ve always</li>
            <li>I bought mine on the bare minerals website, so I know it is the real thing and not expired, etc.</li>
            <li>and it always looks so natural like your not wearing anything at all, which is how make-up is supposed to look!</li>
            <li>I really like bare minerals.</li>
            <li>I will most likely never use any other makeup product!</li>
            <li>Such a small container yet last for a good while.  </li>
            <li>My only real quibble with it is that it is a bit too glow-y for me.  </li>
            <li>I hope they stay in business forever because I&#x27;m spoiled as far as foundations go.</li>
            <li>make sure to wash your brushes at least weekly.</li>
            <li>I will never waste my money on any of these products ever again.</li>
            <li>I have been countering this by mixing my Bare Escentuals with Monave mineral foundation, which is too matte for me, at a ratio of about 3:1.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS TRULY BARE MINERALS MAKEUP.</li>
            <li>Have used Bare Minerals for years.  </li>
            <li>Always get my bare minerals from amazon or sephora.</li>
            <li>After about an hour, the makeup \\&quot;slides\\&quot; off of my nose and chin and clumps up, leaving bare spots.</li>
            <li>I would, however, suggest that anyone who uses this apply the Bare Escentuals Primer before applying the foundation.  </li>
            <li>Careful tho, matte colors are darker than the normal shades so order one lighter!</li>

            <li> I did order it in the exact same color and it does look a tiny bit darker, but I think that it actually matches my skin tone better.  </li>
            <li> have oily combination skin- and very sensitive.</li>
            <li> Never have I had a liquid concealer work nearly as well as this stuff!  </li>
            <li> This was exactly the same product that I&#x27;ve always</li>
            <li> I bought mine on the bare minerals website, so I know it is the real thing and not expired, etc.</li>
            <li> and it always looks so natural like your not wearing anything at all, which is how make-up is supposed to look!</li>
            <li> I really like bare minerals.</li>
            <li> I will most likely never use any other makeup product!</li>
            <li> Such a small container yet last for a good while.  </li>
            <li> My only real quibble with it is that it is a bit too glow-y for me.  </li>
            <li> I hope they stay in business forever because I&#x27;m spoiled as far as foundations go.</li>
            <li> make sure to wash your brushes at least weekly.</li>
            <li> I will never waste my money on any of these products ever again.</li>
            <li> I have been countering this by mixing my Bare Escentuals with Monave mineral foundation, which is too matte for me, at a ratio of about 3:1.  </li>
            <li> THIS IS TRULY BARE MINERALS MAKEUP.</li>
            <li> Have used Bare Minerals for years.  </li>
            <li> Always get my bare minerals from amazon or sephora.</li>
            <li> After about an hour, the makeup \\&quot;slides\\&quot; off of my nose and chin and clumps up, leaving bare spots.</li>
            <li> I would, however, suggest that anyone who uses this apply the Bare Escentuals Primer before applying the foundation.  </li>
            <li> Careful tho, matte colors are darker than the normal shades so order one lighter!</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin and through the middle of the day you can usually see it on my face.</li>
            <li> it is kind of idiotic.</li>
            <li> I recommend this over the regular foundation except if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> Without makeup I have red blotchy skin and constant DARK circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin that breaks out at the mere sight of foundation!</li>
            <li> One side note; It can tend to accentuate dry skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a total let down.  </li>
            <li> It covers well without being too heavy or looking obviously</li>
            <li> it is matte but doesn&#x27;t look cakey or get gross after a few hours.</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying it from Amazon and some of the reviews claiming it to me fake scared me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s just not a whole lot of coverage, I typically have to apply concealer to any imperfections over the powder.</li>
            <li> Lastly, this product is small and not worth the price they charge for it.  </li>
            <li> Its a miracle powder concealer/eyeshadow that makes the dark circles under my eyes vanish.  </li>
            <li> The base will eventually collect very slightly in the tiny wrinkles just below my eyes, but I just smooth it</li>
            <li> Thumbs down for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tired with just the matte makeup, using with the Bare Minerals primer, and with concealer, but it still doesn&#x27;t cover the redness on my skin.</li>
            <li> I suggest that anyone purchasing this product go into a store first and try on the different base colors to select the correct one.</li>
            <li> I have pale, blotchy skin and this foundation hides and corrects all of that.</li>
            <li> I have pale skin</li>
            <li> and I usually forget I&#x27;m even wearing make-up.</li>
            <li> There is no better foundation in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I remember using it for the first time and thinking &amp;#34;this is crap</li>
            <li> And my favorite part about all my bareminerals makeup is that it only takes me about 3 minutes to get my makeup on, and you never have to worry about base lines or any of that annoying stuff.</li>
            <li> Only reason for 4 stars is that it sticks slightly to my peach fuzz but its not too bad.</li>
            <li> I hardly feel like I am wearing foundation at all.  </li>
            <li> so wrong.</li>
            <li> So of course I have to reapply to those areas, but it looks horrible since it&#x27;s all clumped.</li>
            <li> Oh, and if you have even the smallest wrinkles, it will cause them to stand out horribly.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s good:)light and matte as discribed. I usally use Loreal&#x27;s but after reviewed some critics online i thought I need to give it a try. The only thing I think Loreal&#x27;s product is better is the brush comes with the product as a top, it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> I like this foundation and have used it daily since I bought it. I wish it would last all day but it seems to need a touch up by afternoon. I especially like that it isn&#x27;t shiny like the regular bareminerals foundation was for me. So far I am happy and will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> I have been using this foundation for years and I love it.  It has pretty good staying power, which is the biggest problem with mineral makeups to me, but I just spray my face with a light mist of water after applying and that seems to set it pretty well.  Ten hours later when I get home from work it&#x27;s usually just starting to fade a bit, which is pretty good in my book.  I love how natural it looks and how it magically erases the occasional blemish or red blotch on my face.  Never have I had a liquid concealer work nearly as well as this stuff!  It evens out my complexion while somehow still magically showing the freckles on my face, which I like, although I have tested before and it is possible to completely erase my freckles by using a firmer foundation brush to smooth it on a bit heavier.  My only real quibble with it is that it is a bit too glow-y for me.  It leaves me a bit shinier than I prefer to look, and the shine tends to highlight the fine lines on my eyelids.  I have been countering this by mixing my Bare Escentuals with Monave mineral foundation, which is too matte for me, at a ratio of about 3:1.  Just a hint of glow, no greasy look, no loss of staying power.  Good stuff.  I hope they stay in business forever because I&#x27;m spoiled as far as foundations go.</li>
            <li> Great product at better price.</li>
            <li> This is THE most amazing make-up ever. I have pale, blotchy skin and this foundation hides and corrects all of that. It&#x27;s super light on my face and I usually forget I&#x27;m even wearing make-up. I would recommend this item to ANYONE. It&#x27;s totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> Best makeup ever! I have super sensitive skin that breaks out at the mere sight of foundation! I can actually wear this and it feels amazing!!! I love it!!!!!! And best part is its so easy to use and I  only need to use one type for everthing you know? Its great!</li>
            <li> Always loved bareMinerals. Doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and is much more natural looking than liquid foundation. Only reason for 4 stars is that it sticks slightly to my peach fuzz but its not too bad.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and sealed properly.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I love that I could get it for this price with Amazon Prime!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this makeup for those with acne-prone skin and oily/combo skin. The matte finish helps diminish excess oil and shine and decreases the look of pores for an air-brushed look.</li>
            <li> I suggest that anyone purchasing this product go into a store first and try on the different base colors to select the correct one. I love this foundation, as nothing was working correctly for me. I am in my late 40&#x27;s, with very fair, reddish skin (rosacea). Liquid just wasn&#x27;t working. I was wary of powder, but this is great. I use a primer first  (greenish to negate the redness in my complexion). The base will eventually collect very slightly in the tiny wrinkles just below my eyes, but I just smooth it and it&#x27;s fine. Great coverage, and wears all day. My mascara does not run under my eyes now either. It&#x27;s wonderful! I am sold!!</li>
            <li> Best makeup on the planet! This works like nothing else! Try it and you will agree!&lt;br /&gt;I have oily combination skin- and very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I love this make up, it is very light weight.  I hardly feel like I am wearing foundation at all.  Despite this, the foundation covers well.  Sometimes I find that it doesn&#x27;t last all day, and I&#x27;ll need to reapply after work if I am going somewhere for the evening.  The price is better on Amazon than in the store, and you don&#x27;t have to deal with people trying to sell you a thousand other products you don&#x27;t need!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used bareminerals off and on throughout the years and keep finding myself going back to it. This was my first time buying it from Amazon and some of the reviews claiming it to me fake scared me. THIS IS TRULY BARE MINERALS MAKEUP. Maybe it depends on what amazon store you buy from... I got the one from bareBeauty247 which was fulfilled by Amazon. This was exactly the same product that I&#x27;ve always used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone that hasn&#x27;t used it before, I get &amp;#34;Fair&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s the lightest, but not as light as physicians formula matte in translucent (my budget brand) if that helps to compare. It&#x27;s definitely a much better product, it covers better and lasts much longer.</li>
            <li> I use the oil control primer with this foundation. I have really oily skin and through the middle of the day you can usually see it on my face. Other than that, I love BareMinerals and I&#x27;ve been using it for years and have never been satisfied with another foundation product.</li>
            <li> I see no improvement of any kind and I&#x27;ve been using this for a while. The coverage isn&#x27;t as good as the original bare minerals foundation. My skin feels drier when I first apply it, but after a few hours it looks oilier than ever! It is creating a larger problem for me. It really does not work for me at all. I bought mine on the bare minerals website, so I know it is the real thing and not expired, etc. When I saw this come up in my amazon &amp;#34;suggestions,&amp;#34; I couldn&#x27;t resist saying something because I was just thinking how much I dislike this foundation this morning.</li>
            <li> My wife likes it.  That&#x27;s all I know.</li>
            <li> My first time trying bareMinerals. I love the product.</li>
            <li> This matte product covers more effectively than other iterations of their foundation, in my experience, so you can use it as concealer too, and this shade I lighter than the lightest of their bisque products, so it works better for us fair skinned types.  A container this size lasts me 6 months, providing I use a primer.</li>
            <li> This product is great! It covers well without being too heavy or looking obviously like you&#x27;re wearing a lot of makeup.</li>
            <li> Best makeup ever. Careful tho, matte colors are darker than the normal shades so order one lighter!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want it to be true, but this covers so much better than the Avon version.  I had used Avon for several years but was constantly reapplying powder.  I put the bareMinerals on in the morning and am good to go through most days (barring extremely hot, humid weather).  This is definitely a case where you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> I have used the original for so long but I decided to give the matte a try.  I did order it in the exact same color and it does look a tiny bit darker, but I think that it actually matches my skin tone better.  Also, I love to mix my bareminerals foundations anyway to get the perfect color so I often just mix the two.  I recommend this product along with a good finishing powder like mineral veil (although I just use elf finishing powder, just as good and only about $5 for a huge container). I&#x27;ve been using bareminerals foundation for years now and I haven&#x27;t found anything I like more. The coverage is good but so subtle.  I remember using it for the first time and thinking &amp;#34;this is crap, I don&#x27;t even look like I have any makeup on&amp;#34;.  I was so used to caking makeup on at the time. But then I saw pictures of myself out with friends wearing bareminerals foundation, bareminerals well rested, and finishing powder over it, and my skin looked great.  It didn&#x27;t look like I was wearing makeup, it just looked like I had naturally perfect skin. Without makeup I have red blotchy skin and constant DARK circles under my eyes.  I recommend this foundation, but the product by them that I swear by is &amp;#34;well rested for eyes&amp;#34;.  Its a miracle powder concealer/eyeshadow that makes the dark circles under my eyes vanish.  And my favorite part about all my bareminerals makeup is that it only takes me about 3 minutes to get my makeup on, and you never have to worry about base lines or any of that annoying stuff.</li>
            <li> This product is great, I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it always looks so natural like your not wearing anything at all, which is how make-up is supposed to look! It allows your skin to breath so it doesn&#x27;t clog pores or cause breakouts. One side note; It can tend to accentuate dry skin so make sure you moisturize beforehand if your skin is on the dry side or if you use drying skin products like Retinol etc. I use Jane Iredale&#x27;s tinted moisturizer underneath it and love the way it looks, plus I feel like it makes it last a lot longer throughout the day and look that much smoother :) Bonus, it&#x27;s waaay cheaper here on Amazon so I will buy here from now on!</li>
            <li> I will most likely never use any other makeup product! As usual, a flawless application and my skin has never looked better!</li>
            <li> This is my first mineral foundation, normally I stick to my Revlon liquid foundation, but I decided to give something lighter a try. I have extremely fair skin, with a lot of red in it, so I bought this foundation just to even out my skin tone without looking like I&#x27;m wearing a lot of makeup. And that it does!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just not a whole lot of coverage, I typically have to apply concealer to any imperfections over the powder. If you do too many layers, it starts to look cake-y, and nobody wants that. So typically, it&#x27;s good for good-skin days, but on not-so-good-skin-days, I stick with more of a fuller-coverage foundation.</li>
            <li> This is the best foundation I have found for my oily, acne prone skin.  I have worn it for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tries so many kinds of minerals it is kind of idiotic. I tend to go for higher end/&amp;#34;pure&amp;#34;/organic stuff and this is just the best for my skin. It is gentle in my highly reactive skin, works for my skin tone (fairest), and doesn&#x27;t break me out. it is matte but doesn&#x27;t look cakey or get gross after a few hours. it&#x27;s great because it is readily available and you always know what you&#x27;re getting. make sure to wash your brushes at least weekly.</li>
            <li> Have used Bare Minerals for years.  Always happy w/it.</li>
            <li> I have been an avid user of BareMinerals Foundation for the past 5 years and can honestly say that I don&#x27;t plan on changing that any time soon. It goes on so easily and makes my skin look fresh and smooth rather than chalky as I&#x27;ve found some other mineral makeups do. This is a great product line to get stuck on!</li>
            <li> love it.  Such a small container yet last for a good while.  Will defiantly reorder.</li>
            <li> My wife says it&#x27;s a great product and gives sheer coverage.</li>
            <li> I really like bare minerals. The color goes well on my skin, doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, and helps me reduce my shine. Now, this shouldn&#x27;t be worn with too greasy an spf moisturizer, though, or it will need touching up. Otherwise, you&#x27;re good all day.  Blends well, too</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Bare Minerals and this is just one of their great products.  Good coverage without looking like makeup</li>
            <li> Always get my bare minerals from amazon or sephora. Have been using it for years! There is no better foundation in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I used to use the original Bare Minerals, it covered well but it was too shiny. It didn&#x27;t help that I have an oily T-zone. When I saw this product I thought it would be great since it&#x27;s for oily skin, but I was wrong....so wrong. After about an hour, the makeup \\&quot;slides\\&quot; off of my nose and chin and clumps up, leaving bare spots. So of course I have to reapply to those areas, but it looks horrible since it&#x27;s all clumped. There is no \\&quot;smoothing\\&quot; it back out. I ordered the fair shade but it&#x27;s still too dark for me. This matte version does not cover well at all. I&#x27;ve tired with just the matte makeup, using with the Bare Minerals primer, and with concealer, but it still doesn&#x27;t cover the redness on my skin. Oh, and if you have even the smallest wrinkles, it will cause them to stand out horribly. I will never waste my money on any of these products ever again.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite foundation! It has a great matte finish and looks great almost all day with minimal touch-ups required!</li>
            <li> After watching commercials, was excited to try this makeup and brush.  It&#x27;s a total let down.  I have pale skin so purchased the fair makeup &amp; brush.  Doesn&#x27;t look like makeup.  Goes on like light powder.  Not at all what I was expecting.  Thought there would be coverage especially for my freckles and age spots.  It doesn&#x27;t cover anything &amp; just looks like you put powder on your face with no makeup.  Not like the commercials advertise.  Lastly, this product is small and not worth the price they charge for it.  I would not recommend this product.  Thumbs down for me.</li>
            <li> Lasts all day. Great product. Arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.  I would, however, suggest that anyone who uses this apply the Bare Escentuals Primer before applying the foundation.  The Primer really helps the foundation to go on smoothly and to provide the coverage that you want.</li>
            <li> I love bare minerals. Now that they have the matte option it is also much better for me in the summer with my oily skin which is also sensitive and prone to rosacea.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I got my color matched in the store, and have since bought from Amazon when I need more.  It goes on nicely and can be layered for more coverage.  It looks natural and feels really light and clean.</li>
            <li> Only way to go if you have oily skin.  I use to use the regular foundation and my face looked liked I put olive oil on it by afternoon.  The matte is 100% better.  Goes on great.  Stays on in the hot Florida weather.  I recommend this over the regular foundation except if you have dry skin.</li>
