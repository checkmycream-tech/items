            <li>I love the EZ pads they are so  good</li>
            <li>It was a nice surprise for me.</li>
            <li>Just wax and some kind of mesh.</li>
            <li>It kind of dissolves.</li>
            <li>nothing is perfect, but my friend says it has stopped the pain  by a large margin, so, I say it&#x27;s an overwhelming</li>
            <li>Very easy to do.  </li>
            <li>He was thrilled that I was able to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>As you use it there is a gentle way it conforms to the best fit with your gums.  </li>

            <li>Love these liners.  </li>
            <li>Always love and use it and can&#x27;t find in stores around here.</li>
            <li>So very happy when they were back in stock.</li>
            <li>Am completly satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>

            <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>Have not found anything better.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this product and was encouraged by the reviews.</li>
            <li>My Dad had not been able to find this product in a store in our area for quire some time.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Not what the product was intended for but it sure has saved up from a lot of dental bills.</li>
            <li>Cant speak to its value as a denture cushion, but it&#x27;s perfect for fashioning a covering for the lower teeth to protect the lip during long rehearsals or practice sessions-----I play saxophone.</li>
            <li>So far this has worked great for my bottom dentures.</li>
            <li>It molds to my gums and makes the denture more comfortable.</li>
            <li>makes dentures secure, very easy to use you can change it easily and quickly.</li>
            <li>I just got lower dentures and was having problems with the fit.  </li>
            <li>free</li>
            <li>They give a snug fit.</li>
            <li>I will continue buying it at Amazon even if it would happen to become available at the stores again.</li>
            <li>these make dentures fit well.</li>
            <li>This product would work well if you have a smooth gum line, It doesn&#x27;t fill in the highs and lows.</li>
            <li>Gift to someone who was very pleased with the product, I am sure they will want to order them again in the future</li>
            <li>yes!!, it does what It Says, and I will purchase more for her, thanks very much!!</li>
            <li>The claims blurb do not describe the product sufficiently well to inform a buyer as to the true nature of the product.</li>
            <li>I immediately prepared and applied a cushion to my full, lower denture.  </li>
            <li>This was great as it was three packs for a special price, helping me cut down on ordering so often!</li>
            <li>A photo would have been far more informative but would also reduce sales.</li>
            <li>They are worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The only kind my husband can use and he always orders them here.</li>
            <li>Unwieldy , too large for my dentures even with significant trimming.</li>
            <li>Makes denture fit better ,have to trim and shape , takes a long time to install .</li>
            <li>Would never wear my bottom dentures because of the pain they caused but with this product my dentures fit even form a suction seal with no icky denture cream</li>
            <li>great use upper and lower and wouldn&#x27;t go back to anything else</li>
            <li>I was able to cut it down a bit to the size of my denture and easily get it into the denture.</li>
            <li>and I actually like them better.</li>
            <li>But my Dentures actually sit better and they don&#x27;t move while eating.</li>
            <li>Service is so fast!  </li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more when this supply is gone.  </li>
            <li>No product so far has filled the usefulness of this product for me..</li>
            <li>works very well and much better than the creams presently on the market.</li>
            <li>LOVE THEM ESPECIALLY IF YOU CAN&#x27;T AFFORD TO BUY NEW DENTURES</li>
            <li>It is cheap enough to discard rather than hassle with a refund.</li>
            <li>Without the product I can&#x27;t eat much of anything.</li>
            <li>JUST WHAT I NEED, SHIPPING WAS FAST..........</li>
            <li>thanks again for selling this product..</li>
            <li>my father uses these and he likes them better then any other brand</li>
            <li>They work better than Seabond because you can pop out your bridge and rinse it off and it will still be O.K. for the rest of the day, The other brand will sort of fall apart.</li>
            <li>I guess my dentures fit better than I thought because these cushions simply made it painfully tight to wear them..</li>
            <li>i have older lower dentures......</li>
            <li>I applied it and the places on my gums that were being irritated by older dentures were relieved of the pressure and misfitting.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>They were old, not pink like they should have been ,really brittle.</li>
            <li>These are made for temporary use (no longer than 6 weeks) to hold old dentures in place until you can see your dentist.  </li>
            <li>No messy creams tocontend</li>
            <li>Bought for my 86 yr old mother and regret it.</li>
            <li>I like the extra cushion it give in the very front of my teeth.</li>
            <li>My bottom gum line is very irregular do to having work done over several years.</li>
            <li>it got lots of good reviews,  but was too thin and when wet flimsy for me</li>
            <li>The wax cushion works very well and it lasts 2 to 3 days, if the user washes it carefully.</li>
            <li>She actually had developed gum blisters, so when I found these on Amazon and ordered them and gave them to her</li>
            <li>Not long enough.</li>

            <li> Not long enough.</li>
            <li> I had developed a sore spot on my lower gum due to gum shrinkage I think.  </li>
            <li> Any fit problems, this will solve it, ezo-bezo (sorry, I had to).</li>
            <li> I been using ezo for a long time.....can not buy them in this area........</li>
            <li> As long as he uses them I will keep ordering them.</li>
            <li> Holds as long as denture adhesive.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t hold up very long.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to fix the problems of loose denture and gum ache.</li>
            <li> It has no taste, unlike the Perma products, which last much longer, but get very hard very soon and become uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> , I will never switch to the other gummy products.</li>
            <li> Too thick, not flexible enough.  </li>
            <li> any one having trouble with there dentures give ezo a try.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Wasted money.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t the coating of the Heavy cushions.</li>
            <li> They were poorly made usually they last like four days I can&#x27;t get past one day</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my aunt because we were not able to find them in Va or WVA.  </li>
            <li> Hard as sandpaper and do nothing, serves no purpose.</li>
            <li> These are hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Lately I was dismayed to not find it at my drug store.  </li>
            <li> No good,</li>
            <li> it is  to thin  </li>
            <li> All the others just are too thin to help.</li>
            <li> The Walgreens should sell it instead of expensive Seabond.</li>
            <li> very thin, did not work for me, I returned it  </li>
            <li> EZO does not have any unpleasant taste in the mouth and whenever I have a sore in my bottom gum, I can still  wear my dentures with EZO.  </li>
            <li> I found them very uncomfortable..</li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed with these.</li>
            <li> Horrible stuff.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I recommend this product to fix the problems of loose denture and gum ache. The wax cushion works very well and it lasts 2 to 3 days, if the user washes it carefully. The Walgreens should sell it instead of expensive Seabond.</li>
            <li> So far this has worked great for my bottom dentures. Would never wear my bottom dentures because of the pain they caused but with this product my dentures fit even form a suction seal with no icky denture cream</li>
            <li> They are no longer making Cushion Grip. I had to find something to replace it. I tried EZO Cushions and I actually like them better. I have to trim them a lot. But my Dentures actually sit better and they don&#x27;t move while eating. Great Product. I will order this item again.</li>
            <li> They were poorly made usually they last like four days I can&#x27;t get past one day</li>
            <li> These were a gift.  The  receiver was pleased.</li>
            <li> great use upper and lower and wouldn&#x27;t go back to anything else any one having trouble with there dentures give ezo a try.</li>
            <li> I just got lower dentures and was having problems with the fit.  These are like a paraffin material so it is cushy without being sticky like the pastes.  I was able to cut it down a bit to the size of my denture and easily get it into the denture. As you use it there is a gentle way it conforms to the best fit with your gums.  It lasts 3-4 days without any deterioration and never turns sticky.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Mom loves this brand but can&#x27;t find in the store anymore.</li>
            <li> Was a bit disapointed, they dont stay put. But will do in a pinch.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  These are made for temporary use (no longer than 6 weeks) to hold old dentures in place until you can see your dentist.  I tried them. No good,</li>
            <li> I found them very uncomfortable.. I guess my dentures fit better than I thought because these cushions simply made it painfully tight to wear them..</li>
            <li> it is  to thin  it needs to thicker to give cusion  to gums  and support  it needs to be  more order  free</li>
            <li> LOVE THEM ESPECIALLY IF YOU CAN&#x27;T AFFORD TO BUY NEW DENTURES</li>
            <li> I Could not get the item in the stores anymore so I looked it up on Amazon I love this  I can find any thing I need on here this item is the best thing I have found that work for me</li>
            <li> Holds well and no ozzing</li>
            <li> Love these liners.  No messy creams tocontend with,,,Would recommend to anyone who has lower dentures. They give a snug fit.</li>
            <li> I been using ezo for a long time.....can not buy them in this area........so keep a good supply on hand.....................</li>
            <li> Unwieldy , too large for my dentures even with significant trimming. The claims blurb do not describe the product sufficiently well to inform a buyer as to the true nature of the product. A photo would have been far more informative but would also reduce sales. It is cheap enough to discard rather than hassle with a refund.</li>
            <li> I got these to protect my lip when playing saxophone, based on reviews.  I wrap a trimmed one around my lower teeth.  Works for that purpose.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my aunt because we were not able to find them in Va or WVA.  She actually had developed gum blisters, so when I found these on Amazon and ordered them and gave them to her she was so happy and said it was better than any Christmas gift she could have received.</li>
            <li> Always love and use it and can&#x27;t find in stores around here.</li>
            <li> Gift to someone who was very pleased with the product, I am sure they will want to order them again in the future</li>
            <li> Since this product went off the shelves I had no idea of how to get it again. So I decided to look online for it and found it on Amazon. I looked at several different sites and Amazon was the cheapest place to get this product. That was about a year ago. This is my second order. This time the product came over a week earlier than was told to me. Without the product I can&#x27;t eat much of anything. And the product is actually cheaper than buying it at the store. I will continue buying it at Amazon even if it would happen to become available at the stores again. Thank you, thank you. This is from a 50 year denture wearer.</li>
            <li> I too was out of these for a while and couldn&#x27;t find anything to replace them So very happy when they were back in stock.</li>
            <li> I have no idea if its me or what but I simply cannot get this product to work for me.</li>
            <li> these make dentures fit well. would recommend to any denture wearer.,Very comfortable can not buy in stores anymore. You wont be disappointed with these.</li>
            <li> These are the best if you need your dentures to fit better. And with a pack of 3 with 15 in a pack, you don&#x27;t have to worry about buying them so often. They are worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The only thing that works</li>
            <li> very thin, did not work for me, I returned it  it got lots of good reviews,  but was too thin and when wet flimsy for me</li>
            <li> The only kind my husband can use and he always orders them here. This was great as it was three packs for a special price, helping me cut down on ordering so often!</li>
            <li> JUST WHAT I NEED, SHIPPING WAS FAST..........</li>
            <li> nothing is perfect, but my friend says it has stopped the pain  by a large margin, so, I say it&#x27;s an overwhelming yes!!, it does what It Says, and I will purchase more for her, thanks very much!!, Dave.g</li>
            <li> on the ezo I only rec two boxes of 15</li>
            <li> I love the EZ pads they are so  good I can,t buy them where I live,so I will be buying them often</li>
            <li> Am completly satisfied with this product. It is what was described in the the description, was delivered on time and it was in good shape when it arrived.</li>
            <li> My husband will not use anything else because they provide comfort and are inexpensive to order. As long as he uses them I will keep ordering them.</li>
            <li> This deserves the 5 stars. makes dentures secure, very easy to use you can change it easily and quickly. The price is very fair for what it does</li>
            <li> Cant speak to its value as a denture cushion, but it&#x27;s perfect for fashioning a covering for the lower teeth to protect the lip during long rehearsals or practice sessions-----I play saxophone.</li>
            <li> Bought for my 86 yr old mother and regret it. Wasted money. Hard as sandpaper and do nothing, serves no purpose.</li>
            <li> Always a very good experience.  Service is so fast!  Love it</li>
            <li> I just received these cushions a couple hours ago.  I immediately prepared and applied a cushion to my full, lower denture.  Very easy to do.  I had developed a sore spot on my lower gum due to gum shrinkage I think.  Immediate relief.  Denture fits well and the irritation can not be felt.  I did not have to do any trimming.  Directions say not to use more than 6 weeks.  With a &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; reline at $600, I may ignore that part...we&#x27;ll see.  Will definitely buy more when this supply is gone.  Local retail stores do not stock.</li>
            <li> works very well and much better than the creams presently on the market.</li>
            <li> Holds dentures snug as suppose to, can no longer get product in Walgreens anymore, had to have and was told to Google it and find sources to purchase. Why would a Drug store chain sell a great product then cease carrying it, I have no idea! But, I know now how to get product.</li>
            <li> They were old, not pink like they should have been ,really brittle.</li>
            <li> Makes denture fit better ,have to trim and shape , takes a long time to install . Holds as long as denture adhesive. Not long enough.</li>
            <li> I have used fpr years&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;denture cushion  I have  used theise for years ,and the do the job for me</li>
            <li> Too thick, not flexible enough.  Don&#x27;t stick.</li>
            <li> i have older lower dentures......these are the &amp;#34;only&amp;#34; product that hold my dentures in and i can eat...thanks again for selling this product..</li>
            <li> I had been buying from Meijer but the count must have been low or a competitor&#x27;s replacement product was  chosen. No product so far has filled the usefulness of this product for me..</li>
            <li> These are hard to find in stores. Walgreens, CVS do not handle these.Thankful for the internet! I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I like the extra cushion it give in the very front of my teeth. It molds to my gums and makes the denture more comfortable. I&#x27;ve never heard of them before and decided on trying them and glad I took the chance of being wrong. It was a nice surprise for me.</li>
            <li> Have not found anything better.</li>
            <li> Horrible stuff. Just wax and some kind of mesh. Does not conform to mouth. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> These are the only ones I can use. All the others just are too thin to help. Love them!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used EZO denture cushions for my lower teeth for over 50 years.  Lately I was dismayed to not find it at my drug store.  I tried another product and immediately spit it out.  EZO does not have any unpleasant taste in the mouth and whenever I have a sore in my bottom gum, I can still  wear my dentures with EZO.  So happy Amazon had these available for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having worn dentures from the age of 25 to the current age of 81, I will never switch to the other gummy products.</li>
            <li> Given that it&#x27;s designed for daily use, I find that I&#x27;m getting several days use from them.  It has no taste, unlike the Perma products, which last much longer, but get very hard very soon and become uncomfortable.  Trimming the EZO cushion after it&#x27;s been fitted makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Did help the kit of dentures.</li>
            <li> my father uses these and he likes them better then any other brand</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD PRODUCT, EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE.</li>
            <li> This product has been a great help for me.  I applied it and the places on my gums that were being irritated by older dentures were relieved of the pressure and misfitting.  I am so glad I found this product and was encouraged by the reviews.</li>
            <li> My Dad had not been able to find this product in a store in our area for quire some time.  He was thrilled that I was able to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t the coating of the Heavy cushions. Now I have to use 2.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Nothing else compares.</li>
            <li> These are great. They work better than Seabond because you can pop out your bridge and rinse it off and it will still be O.K. for the rest of the day, The other brand will sort of fall apart.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me. My bottom gum line is very irregular do to having work done over several years. This product would work well if you have a smooth gum line, It doesn&#x27;t fill in the highs and lows.</li>
            <li> works great with dentures that need relining</li>
            <li> There is nothing out in the stores as good as these denture pads, there Great</li>
            <li> I love this!! I happened upon the name &amp;#34;Ezo&amp;#34; in a message board about something else. I&#x27;m so glad! The perfect product to help my dentures fit while I&#x27;m waiting for my reline. So, so easy, moldable, trimable, removable -- just the best. Any fit problems, this will solve it, ezo-bezo (sorry, I had to).</li>
            <li> This would help give some comfort but it doesn&#x27;t hold up very long. It kind of dissolves. There are a lot of good reviews on this but I don&#x27;t understand why because there is nothing great about these cushions.</li>
            <li> My son uses this product to protect his teeth when practicing woodwinds for hours at a time.  Not what the product was intended for but it sure has saved up from a lot of dental bills.</li>
