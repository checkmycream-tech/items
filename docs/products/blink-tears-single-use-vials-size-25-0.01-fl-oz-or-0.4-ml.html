            <li>needed these for my LASIK post-treatment care and they worked great!</li>
            <li>Some of the best I have found.</li>
            <li>These Blink Tears Lubricating Eye Drops feel wonderfully soothing to my eyes.  </li>
            <li>These drops are perfect for me because they aren&#x27;t the thicker, almost gel-like drops that obscure my vision for a number of minutes.  </li>
            <li>Great for after LASIK!!</li>
            <li>Best eye moisturizing drops I have used.</li>

            <li>Overall, a great product!</li>
            <li>But if you want something totally sting-free or, like me, wanted to give hyaluronic acid a try, these are GREAT!</li>
            <li>This is more lubricating and makes contact lens wearing more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>use the vials many times during the day</li>
            <li>/&gt;Instead, I have settled on being better hydrated (drinking more water) and using lubricating drops.</li>

            <li>This is the best product for dry eyes.</li>
            <li>They are oh so easy on my eyes with no drying side effects like so many others.  </li>
            <li>And preservative free drops are better for your eyes.</li>

            <li>I barely notice when a Blink tear hits my eye, which is really, really pleasant.</li>
            <li>Keep these on hand for contacts and allergy season, the small tubes are resealable and perfect for travel.  </li>
            <li>never disappointed</li>
            <li>Wow, am I ever glad I did!</li>
            <li>Keep them in the fridge to cool your eyes when you apply.</li>
            <li>Blink and Clear Eyes work better for me than the Visine.</li>
            <li>Worth it,</li>
            <li>I like that they are not the kind of eye drops that &amp;#34;get the red out&amp;#34</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that the solution is preservative free and single use, although I&#x27;m glad they provide a lid, because I generally use each vial twice.</li>
            <li>I can feel relief right away</li>
            <li>Developed dry eye after cataract surgery and after reading great reviews about it, decided to try this product.</li>
            <li>The solution&#x27;s very gentle for cleansing, moisturizing and comforting redness.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t sting at all and help me see more clearly following the LASIK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These drops worked at first when I got LASIK</li>
            <li>Instant relief--so much more effective than any other drops I had tried before.</li>
            <li>They really helpful after a round of golf in windy conditions, and offer good relief.  </li>
            <li>It is much easier to use than a large bottle and there is no worry for contamination.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast too.</li>
            <li>They prevent my eyes from becoming dry.</li>
            <li>Being individual files, they stay fresh longer.</li>
            <li>Personally I would prefer the &#x27;Blink&#x27; product which comes in a large container and is much easier to use.</li>
            <li>This stuff answers all my needs and allows me to refill by just ordering a new box....</li>

            <li>It is preservative-free, effective at relieving (serious) dry eyes and reasonably priced.</li>

            <li>Highly recommended for dry, allergy ridden,  sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>have tried using single use vials of saline, but you can really tell the difference between this and saline.</li>
            <li>What I like about the Blink is that I can scatter the vials around the house where I generally need them (computer, bedside, piano, purse),</li>
            <li>This is important because you would otherwise waste what&#x27;s left in the vial after using only one or two drops.</li>
            <li>I needed to use one vial every half hour for the first two weeks and one every hour for the second two weeks.</li>
            <li>Mainly, I like the feel of blink tears over other products.</li>
            <li>I totally depend on these; the single use vial keeps it fresh without preservatives (which irritate my eyes).&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other single use vials, you can put the lid back on these to use again later.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Moisturises the eyes as advertised</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, keeps your eyes well moisturized. Overall, a great product!</li>
            <li> Keep these on hand for contacts and allergy season, the small tubes are resealable and perfect for travel.  The solution&#x27;s very gentle for cleansing, moisturizing and comforting redness.</li>
            <li> I was recently diagnosed with Map-Dot-Fingerprint eye dystrophy, and my doctor recommended using drops several times daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using [[ASIN:B0036B8QK6 Systane Ultra Lubricant Eye Drops Preservative-Free Vials]] for normally dry eyes, but had read that Blink and a few other brands contained hyaluronic acid -- which had shown some demonstrated corneal healing properties in some studies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Keep in mind, this is Dr. Google speaking. My &amp;#34;actually went to medical school and is one of a limited number of specialists at a world renowned eye center at a well-known university&amp;#34; doctor didn&#x27;t send me out to buy these by name, or to seek out hyaluronic acid.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that disclaimer, these were basically the same price as the Systane drops I was using, and they were on the big list of suggested brands of preservative-free drops given to me (along with Systane and others). So, I had nothing to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right off the bat, Blink tears sting less than Systane does. I barely notice when a Blink tear hits my eye, which is really, really pleasant. And, drumroll... I&#x27;ve noticed that my vision doesn&#x27;t get as bad as often as it used to. I now use these vials throughout the day, and [[ASIN:B001BJAOGO Blink Gel Tears (NOT preservative-free!)]] at night, and the results have been excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I have noticed, is that my eyes seem to feel dry much sooner with Blink than with Systane Ultra. If I wasn&#x27;t buying these for a specific ingredient, I&#x27;d probably stick with Systane from a value and convenience perspective. But if you want something totally sting-free or, like me, wanted to give hyaluronic acid a try, these are GREAT!</li>
            <li> Lasik eye surgery left me with double vision, impaired visual acuity, and chronic eye pain - including LIDED (Lasik Induced Dry Eye Disease). I&#x27;ve tried every eye drop on the market and Blink tears in the single use vial are my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning to anyone who uses eye drops frequently (I do at least 40 times a day and several times during the night): avoid any eye drops with preservatives and only use single use vials such as these. Over time the preservatives can be toxic to your eyes and actually exacerbate dry eye disease - something I learned the hard way.</li>
            <li> I like these eye drops a lot since I&#x27;ve been using them awhile.</li>
            <li> Used this product after having lasik surgery. I eventually switched to the gel which lasts longer and I have to use less often</li>
            <li> These are a great size to carry around and use when needed. I got Lasik surgery and use them everyday. It is much easier to use than a large bottle and there is no worry for contamination.</li>
            <li> I have dry eyes and have been told to use drops throughout the day. I&#x27;ve tried all manner of products but I like the single vial because I can reuse one a day and keep it in my purse or pocket or at my office and throw it away. It doesn&#x27;t have preservatives which I prefer. Mainly, I like the feel of blink tears over other products. I can feel relief right away and I think the relief lasts longer. Obviously how something feels is subjective but I do notice a difference.</li>
            <li> needed these for my LASIK post-treatment care and they worked great! Cheaper than buying through my vision center.</li>
            <li> Works great and no preservatives.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for dry eyes. It is preservative-free, effective at relieving (serious) dry eyes and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> These are great to have with you when you are on the go. Being individual files, they stay fresh longer. Use blink almost every day. Some of the best I have found. I also use the thicker gel for serious irritation.</li>
            <li> I totally depend on these; the single use vial keeps it fresh without preservatives (which irritate my eyes).&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other single use vials, you can put the lid back on these to use again later. This is important because you would otherwise waste what&#x27;s left in the vial after using only one or two drops. None of the other brands can do this.&lt;br /&gt;These are relatively expensive, but because I waste less, I can easily justify it.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried using single use vials of saline, but you can really tell the difference between this and saline. This is more lubricating and makes contact lens wearing more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I would have given it five stars if I could get this with my Amazon subscription service.</li>
            <li> My ophthalmologist recommended I try these to help with Dry Eye Syndrome.  I like that they don&#x27;t seem to leave a blurring residue in your eyes.  They really helpful after a round of golf in windy conditions, and offer good relief.  I alternate these with Soothe eye drops and Thearatears Liquigel at night.</li>
            <li> I love these. And preservative free drops are better for your eyes.</li>
            <li> Blink tears single use vials is just what I have been looking for,an over-the counter remedy for my very dry eyes.

            <li> Of all the preservative free lubricant eye drops these are the best for me.</li>
            <li> My eyes are very dry and burn all of the time.  Blink Tears is very helpful in relieving them for a short time.&lt;br /&gt;I use the vials many times during the day</li>
            <li> Developed dry eye after cataract surgery and after reading great reviews about it, decided to try this product. Wow, am I ever glad I did! Instant relief--so much more effective than any other drops I had tried before. Can&#x27;t say enough positive things.</li>
            <li> Using these on the recommendation of the doctor after LASIK.  They work great. Keep them in the fridge to cool your eyes when you apply.</li>
            <li> My eye doctor recently diagnosed me with dry eye and piled on the prescriptions for eye vitamins and Restasis. I didn&#x27;t want to go the nuclear option right off the bat -- you need to take Restasis for the rest of your life and the vitamins are prohibitively expensive. Both take months to have any effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, I have settled on being better hydrated (drinking more water) and using lubricating drops. It&#x27;s a strategy that seems to be working. I&#x27;ve tried many types of drops, including [[ASIN:B001U3YKAC Clear Eyes Natural Tears for Mild Dry Eye]] and [[ASIN:B0019GAXAG Visine Tears Lubricant Eye Drops, Long Lasting Dry Eye Relief]], as well as this product, Blink Tears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Blink and Clear Eyes work better for me than the Visine. What I like about the Blink is that I can scatter the vials around the house where I generally need them (computer, bedside, piano, purse), so I&#x27;m not always looking for a bottle somewhere. It&#x27;s nice that the solution is preservative free and single use, although I&#x27;m glad they provide a lid, because I generally use each vial twice.</li>
            <li> Worth it, but I recently found these in stores.</li>
            <li> I got lasik done about 6 weeks ago and my eye doctor gave me Blink to use. Didn&#x27;t have any problems, but then tried Refresh Plus because it&#x27;s cheaper. My eyes started to burn even when I used the drops religiously. I switched back to Blink and the burning went away. Haven&#x27;t had any problems since. Shipping was fast too.</li>
            <li> Recommenced by the doctor after I got Lasik Surgery because these are preservative free.  Also a few dollars cheaper than what the doctor&#x27;s office wanted.</li>
            <li> I just had PRK LASIK and the doctor&#x27;s office recommends this brand and type of lubricating drops because the procedure leaves your eyes very dry for a while. I needed to use one vial every half hour for the first two weeks and one every hour for the second two weeks. They don&#x27;t sting at all and help me see more clearly following the LASIK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to keep them in the fridge because the cold feels extra-refreshing and also lets me know when the eye drop is in my eye! As others have mentioned, the individual vials are very convenient - I scatter them throughout the house, car, office. When I can&#x27;t find one, I feel a little bit of a druggie looking for my fix!</li>
            <li> These Blink Tears Lubricating Eye Drops feel wonderfully soothing to my eyes.  I wear contact lenses, and sometimes they get very dry and uncomfortable.  These drops are perfect for me because they aren&#x27;t the thicker, almost gel-like drops that obscure my vision for a number of minutes.  These simply sooth my eyes as well as moisten them.  My vision is improved after these seem to wash away dirt &amp; dust.  I like that they are not the kind of eye drops that &amp;#34;get the red out&amp;#34;, which are irritating.  I recommend them.</li>
            <li> Great for after LASIK!! Don&#x27;t pay more at your eye doctor. These are exactly what you need lol</li>
            <li> These drops worked at first when I got LASIK but now they dry my eyes out so I had to move on.</li>
            <li> My opthamologist insists that I use this stuff because it doesn&#x27;t contain a preservative (which he thinks could damage my cornea). Personally I would prefer the &#x27;Blink&#x27; product which comes in a large container and is much easier to use.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite eye drops.  They are oh so easy on my eyes with no drying side effects like so many others.  Sometimes I have trouble finding them in stores so that is why I prefer Amazon,  two days, it&#x27;s there.  Highly recommended for dry, allergy ridden,  sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> been buying them off of amazon for years.  never disappointed</li>
            <li> Best eye moisturizing drops I have used. I use them before I put in my contacts. They prevent my eyes from becoming dry.</li>
