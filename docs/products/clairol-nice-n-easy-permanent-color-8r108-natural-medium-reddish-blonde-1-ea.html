    <ol>
            <li>, the color was perfect.</li>
            <li>I have been using this brand for 5 years and it is the best hair color I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>*GOOD LUCK!!</li>
            <li>GREAT color!</li>
            <li>Great quality product that gives excellent results.</li>
            <li>or so it was great</li>
            <li>and it was great.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>The product is great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Frankly, this gets 4-stars because it is not a foam applicaiton; the simplest ever, with great results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a happy woman&lt;</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t look like a carrot, then this is probably a great product for you.</li>
            <li>Looking for a great, safe color that works, LASTS, plus provides great coverage??  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t look good.</li>
            <li>but it just doesn&#x27;t look good like that.</li>
            <li>So continuous of this hair dye will  make you ends darker and it will not look good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with the color and the way my hair feels with the Colorseal Conditioning Gloss.</li>
            <li>It gave me this awesome shade of bright red that I loved.</li>
            <li>It looks kind of like a reverse ombre</li>
            <li>It&#x27;sstill  deserving of comment, and will be used again - already planning on a &amp;#34;dye-fest&amp;#34; with a friend who could use a tad of what I have not used.</li>
            <li>Very easy.</li>
            <li>i had used nice and easy previouly never the the foam.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for years &amp; love it.  </li>
            <li>I also love the color.</li>
            <li>I checked iwth my doctors to be sure I could use this with chemotherapy - not all can nor should be used.</li>
            <li>I was a &amp;#34;carrot-top&amp;#34; for many years, then about age 50</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many colors through th years that are discontinued after a year or two.</li>
            <li>and I found my favorite hair color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>otherwise you&#x27;ll turn into a carrot top.</li>
            <li>I look like carrot top</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find this color in stores anymore.</li>
            <li>I loved this color the first tie I used it.</li>
            <li>the color is perfect and the conditioner is great and it lasts as long as it says and it keeps me natural.</li>
            <li>is so easy.</li>
            <li>Did I mention how easy this was to apply?</li>
            <li>Easy for a novice to use</li>
            <li>Blondes may have more fun, but redheads have more pizzazz, trust me on this.</li>
            <li>Like it is insanely strong and you don&#x27;t want to try sleeping with this smell surrounding you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This does exactly what it says it does - nice and easy.</li>
            <li>So, I used it, it covered my gray, and it really left my hair feeling better than when I used L&#x27;Oreal Superior Preference - 7LA Lightest Auburn.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for saving the day!!!</li>
            <li>Nice and Easy has been my choice for most of the last 45 years!</li>
            <li>This particular one is the easiest to use with the most BEAUTIFUL color and dimensional results - The next day everyone who saw my hair asked where I had it done!!</li>
            <li>My roots are still the bright red</li>
            <li>I use Natural Reddish Blonde, which is not always easy to find, so I&#x27;m happy to find it in triples here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Been using Clairol Nice &#x27;n Easy for years now just for fun, long before any grays.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve given up on boxed hair color from local stores and Amazon and go to Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply and get the AGE Beautiful 9RC Light Strawberry Blonde with the 20 volume developer.</li>
            <li>I have used this color for years and it is the same old great.</li>
            <li>and I was right.</li>
            <li>Nowadays, Walmart does not carry Natural Reddish Blonde in Nice &#x27;N Easy hair color.  </li>
            <li>The color Clairol Nice &amp; Easy  108 Natural Reddish blonde has been taken off the shelves !</li>
            <li>It has a more realistic light red color to it than L&#x27;oreal does.</li>
            <li>your hair is any darker than a very light brown though; I would go up to the next color, #110.</li>
            <li>So, I bought this because it looked the most natural on the hair dye aisle and had read the reviews that it was pretty decent.</li>
            <li>I have been using this hair dye for years and for the first year</li>
            <li>i called the hot line and lady</li>
            <li>AND THIS THE FIRST TIME</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this one now!!      </li>
            <li>I have a hard time finding this colore any more and it is so easy to just go and order it online!</li>
            <li>So glad to finally get the color I needed.</li>
            <li>I had been using 104 Natural Medium Golden Blonde and was happy with it until someone commented that my hair isn&#x27;t as red as it used to be which is correct.</li>
            <li>This was a great color, it made my hair feel extremely soft, butt is yet another color that I liked and is no longer available in stores which means it has probably been discontinued and will be shortly unavailable on Amazon as so many of the light red colors I have used in the past few years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural redhead and finding the best color has been frustrating.</li>
            <li>I used Loreal Medium Redish Blonde , y hair was too brassy, the Light Reddish Blonde wasn&#x27;t much better.</li>
            <li>but this product certainly didn&#x27;t give me what I was hoping for.    </li>
            <li>the unused portions stay tightly capped in their own bottles in between.</li>
            <li>MUCH</li>
            <li>is much stronger than L&#x27;Oreal Preference.</li>
            <li>Thank you Clairol and thanks Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much, Amazon, for giving me my hair color</li>
            <li>Is a light &#x27;reddish strawberry blonde too a rkda&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It is a true natural looking red.</li>
            <li>I am a natural redhead and as I&#x27;ve gotten older (I&#x27;m 32)</li>
            <li>The hair dye actually dyes pretty quickly so don&#x27;t leave it in as long as the product states</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very soft and covers my temples.</li>
            <li>This review refers to color 108 Natural Reddish Blonde: I fluctuate between wanting auburn hair and light strawberry blonde hair.</li>
            <li>my hair has turned into this odd shade of light brown.</li>
            <li>It is not horrible but it definitely is too dark for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products but the color is not as true and they wash out eventually.  </li>
            <li>It is super red and looks obviously dyed which I try to avoid.</li>
            <li>I love this color and it&#x27;s getting really hard to find</li>
            <li>Now I only leave it on for about 10 minutes but it still dyes my ends much darker that my roots.</li>
            <li>I am now 67 years old and still want that color.  </li>
            <li>The lower section of my hair is much lighter blonde!     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually had people ask me if I&#x27;m one of those rare people who have naturally red</li>
            <li>I tried other companies&#x27; colors that were labeled &amp;#34;natural reddish blonde&amp;#34;, but they just weren&#x27;t right.  </li>
            <li>Price is a bit high but it is the ONLY way to get the product.</li>
            <li>Have been using this product for years and suddenly had a hard time finding the color I wanted, so I came to my favorite website (Amazon) and boom, there it was.</li>
            <li>It is a soft red that truly looks natural.</li>
            <li>I have naturally strawberry blonde hair.</li>
            <li>The description reads Natural Reddish Blonde</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 108 Natural Reddish Blonde.</li>
            <li>I was born a natural reddish blonde and have always tried to maintain that color.  </li>
            <li>It always looks natural, even though my &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; color would now be white.</li>
            <li>The color is simple to moderate, and it can also be intensified, which I had to do with the first application, on a hunch due to the fact that a condition resulting from the chemotherapy removed the pigment from my hair (now being treated, it is coming back!), and I&#x27;ll be &amp;#34;back&amp;#34; and apprecate this product.</li>
            <li>i am white and skin aound my face and neck was pure black</li>

            <li> i am white and skin aound my face and neck was pure black</li>
            <li> I was worried due to it being over 5 years old.</li>
            <li> the natural reddish blond turned out to be a darker red than the previous ones I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Use only HALF &amp; save the rest for next application!!    </li>
            <li> It is not as red as shown on the box and does not fade or look brassy like other manufacturers&#x27; hair colors do.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally dark blonde, &amp;#34;dirty blonde&amp;#34; as they call it.</li>
            <li> , my hair is short, so I get two applications out of each box by mixing half the chemicals at a time.</li>
            <li> I have very dark red bands running horizontally through my hair, and the \\&quot;highlights\\&quot; are everywhere.</li>
            <li> It is just as dark as auburn.</li>
            <li> Twice it even turned the ends of my hair black</li>
            <li> i color and when i came out it black around my skin</li>
            <li> and I had to get the color corrected professionally, which is expensive.</li>
            <li> PS &amp; coloring advice - I&#x27;m coloring over dark hair and it lifted to the color shown on box at the peroxide volume provided!!  </li>

            <li> I have been using this hair dye for years and for the first year or so it was great, the color was perfect. I am a natural redhead and as I&#x27;ve gotten older (I&#x27;m 32) my hair has turned into this odd shade of light brown. I absolutely hate it so I started dying my hair using this and it was great. It gave me this awesome shade of bright red that I loved. So I kept using it. But then is started dying the ends of my hair darker than my roots. Twice it even turned the ends of my hair black and I had to get the color corrected professionally, which is expensive. Now I only leave it on for about 10 minutes but it still dyes my ends much darker that my roots. My roots are still the bright red I like but the ends are almost brown. It looks kind of like a reverse ombre and it doesn&#x27;t look good. I&#x27;ve tried just dying my roots and not the rest of my hair but it just doesn&#x27;t look good like that. So continuous of this hair dye will  make you ends darker and it will not look good.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Arrived quickly.  As advertised.  Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Great quality product that gives excellent results. I have been using this brand for 5 years and it is the best hair color I&#x27;ve ever used. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> i had used nice and easy previouly never the the foam. i use 5r borwn wth red highlight. i color and when i came out it black around my skin i could not take it off. i called the hot line and lady call me twice and said it was too bad wait a few days. i am white and skin aound my face and neck was pure black , i scrub, used acholo, hydroyen period side and nothing. i never reciec&#x3D;ved a call back from this f company. its the worst . ever its been 3 weeks and i still have spots in back of my neck. KEEP AWAY, DO NOT USE. I NEVER VIDIO THE ACCIDENT I WAS SO MAD, I WOULD HAVE SUED. THE  COMPANY NEVER EVEN BORED TO CORRECT THE SITUATION. THE LADY ON THE PHONE STATED IT DOES HAPPEN.&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE BEEN COLORING MY HAIR FOR YEARS AND THIS THE FIRST TIME THIS HAPPENS. NOT ONLY DO THEY MISLEAD THE PUBLIC THEY NEVER STAND BY THE PRODUCT. STAY AWAY DO NOT BUY. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE MY SKIN WAS RED AND NO MATTERHOW MUCH I SCRUW IT DID NTO WORK FOR OVER A 2 WKS. DO NOT USE</li>
            <li> Been using Clairol Nice &#x27;n Easy for years now just for fun, long before any grays.  This particular one is the easiest to use with the most BEAUTIFUL color and dimensional results - The next day everyone who saw my hair asked where I had it done!! Looking for a great, safe color that works, LASTS, plus provides great coverage??  I highly recommend this one now!!      PS &amp; coloring advice - I&#x27;m coloring over dark hair and it lifted to the color shown on box at the peroxide volume provided!!  Short hair??  Use only HALF &amp; save the rest for next application!!    **GOOD LUCK!!**</li>
            <li> I have naturally strawberry blonde hair. Now with gray unfortunately which has led me to the search to match it. The description reads Natural Reddish Blonde but I had a lot of hesitation when looking at the actual color on the box. It didn&#x27;t seem to have any blonde at all. I took the plunge and I was right. I don&#x27;t see how it can be considered blonde at all. It is super red and looks obviously dyed which I try to avoid. There are highlights but they are shine, not blonde. It is not horrible but it definitely is too dark for me. I had been using 104 Natural Medium Golden Blonde and was happy with it until someone commented that my hair isn&#x27;t as red as it used to be which is correct. This is definitely not the solution. I may have to go back to Loreal.</li>
            <li> This review refers to color 108 Natural Reddish Blonde: I fluctuate between wanting auburn hair and light strawberry blonde hair. I thought this shade would be somewhere in the middle. It&#x27;s not. It is just as dark as auburn. My grays are still there at my temples despite applying the dye to that area 15 minutes before the rest of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odor is much stronger than L&#x27;Oreal Preference.</li>
            <li> The product is great. It leaves my hair very soft and covers my temples. It beats L&#x27;oreal. However when buying this product, please pay attention to the date. Mine was from 2007. I called Clairol, and they said that it didn&#x27;t have an actual expiration date. I was worried due to it being over 5 years old. I was assured that there was nothing wrong with it being from 2007. So, I used it, it covered my gray, and it really left my hair feeling better than when I used L&#x27;Oreal Superior Preference - 7LA Lightest Auburn. It has a more realistic light red color to it than L&#x27;oreal does.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years &amp; love it.  I am very disappointed that it is being discontinued. Don&#x27;t know what I will do</li>
            <li> Can buy in drugstore for 7.99 each</li>
            <li> This does exactly what it says it does - nice and easy. Very easy. I like it because it&#x27;s application is so easy. Did I mention how easy this was to apply? I also love the color.</li>
            <li> I love this color and it&#x27;s getting really hard to find but I know I can always get it through Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I checked iwth my doctors to be sure I could use this with chemotherapy - not all can nor should be used. I was a &amp;#34;carrot-top&amp;#34; for many years, then about age 50 I went into strawberry-blonde, and had to begin watching my color choices in clothing, make-up, etc. Now, having lost hair and also pigment, I was faced with finding a color rinse,or whatever tolastawhilel, and help me during a time when I am simiply too tired to fret about my hair, muchless the colors of my clothing, make-up, etc. and a fatiguing aoplicationprocess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, this gets 4-stars because it is not a foam applicaiton; the simplest ever, with great results. It&#x27;sstill  deserving of comment, and will be used again - already planning on a &amp;#34;dye-fest&amp;#34; with a friend who could use a tad of what I have not used. The color is simple to moderate, and it can also be intensified, which I had to do with the first application, on a hunch due to the fact that a condition resulting from the chemotherapy removed the pigment from my hair (now being treated, it is coming back!), and I&#x27;ll be &amp;#34;back&amp;#34; and apprecate this product.</li>
            <li> the color is perfect and the conditioner is great and it lasts as long as it says and it keeps me natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural redhead and finding the best color has been frustrating. I&#x27;ve used so many colors through th years that are discontinued after a year or two. I loved this color the first tie I used it. It&#x27;s 108 Natural Reddish Blonde. The problem has been finding it, very few stores have it. I used Loreal Medium Redish Blonde , y hair was too brassy, the Light Reddish Blonde wasn&#x27;t much better. I decided to order hair color from Amazon and I found my favorite hair color.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m very satisfied with the color and the way my hair feels with the Colorseal Conditioning Gloss.I&#x27;m a happy woman&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you Clairol and thanks Amazon.

            <li> I was born a natural reddish blonde and have always tried to maintain that color.  I am now 67 years old and still want that color.  Nowadays, Walmart does not carry Natural Reddish Blonde in Nice &#x27;N Easy hair color.  I had used it for over 45 years and missed it a lot.  I tried other companies&#x27; colors that were labeled &amp;#34;natural reddish blonde&amp;#34;, but they just weren&#x27;t right.  Thank you so much, Amazon, for giving me my hair color I have had all my life!  The box does not show the actual color.  It is not as red as shown on the box and does not fade or look brassy like other manufacturers&#x27; hair colors do.  GREAT color!</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding this colore any more and it is so easy to just go and order it online! Will order it again. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Okay. So, I bought this because it looked the most natural on the hair dye aisle and had read the reviews that it was pretty decent. The hair dye actually dyes pretty quickly so don&#x27;t leave it in as long as the product states otherwise you&#x27;ll turn into a carrot top. Also, the smell is absolutely terrible after you&#x27;ve washed out the dye and have to deal with it for the next few days. Like it is insanely strong and you don&#x27;t want to try sleeping with this smell surrounding you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your sense of smell is terrible and you cut the time in half so you don&#x27;t look like a carrot, then this is probably a great product for you.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this color for years and it has become nearly impossible to find it locally.  Price is a bit high but it is the ONLY way to get the product.</li>
            <li> I have looked in three Wal-Mart stores &amp; three Walgreen &amp; one K-Mart Store ! The color Clairol Nice &amp; Easy  108 Natural Reddish blonde has been taken off the shelves ! Please tell me you are not dropping this color as this is the only color I like &amp; use !This has happened to me before in another brand ! There are still red heads in the world &amp; I feel some time we are being discreminated against !  Please keep this on the shelves ! I do not like to order on line because I don&#x27;t like giving my credit card No.  thank you !.....</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally dark blonde, &amp;#34;dirty blonde&amp;#34; as they call it. I&#x27;ve tried several different brands and colors, and settled on this one. It is a soft red that truly looks natural. No joke - I&#x27;ve actually had people ask me if I&#x27;m one of those rare people who have naturally red hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair is any darker than a very light brown though; I would go up to the next color, #110.</li>
            <li> This was a great color, it made my hair feel extremely soft, butt is yet another color that I liked and is no longer available in stores which means it has probably been discontinued and will be shortly unavailable on Amazon as so many of the light red colors I have used in the past few years.  So I&#x27;ve given up on boxed hair color from local stores and Amazon and go to Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply and get the AGE Beautiful 9RC Light Strawberry Blonde with the 20 volume developer.</li>
            <li> Hated This Product. It smells terrible. Stung my eyes and my scalp. Made my hair feel like straw. And the color is atrocious! I look like carrot top and I left it in for the shortest time recommended.    In addition, this product made \\&quot;lines\\&quot; in my hair. I have very dark red bands running horizontally through my hair, and the \\&quot;highlights\\&quot; are everywhere. The lower section of my hair is much lighter blonde!     Wish I&#x27;d never tried this. I don&#x27;t know why everyone raves about this stinky stuff! Try Garnier Nutrisse. I only tried this because Garnier discontinued my color but this product certainly didn&#x27;t give me what I was hoping for.    TOTALLY HATE THIS HAIR COLOR! I WOULD GIVE IT NO STARS IF I COULD.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products but the color is not as true and they wash out eventually.  Nice and Easy has been my choice for most of the last 45 years!</li>
            <li> I have used this color for years and it is the same old great. Easy for a novice to use</li>
            <li> Clairol discontinued this color and I have used this for years.  So glad to finally get the color I needed.</li>
            <li> . . .I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 50 (yes, 5-0) years! It always looks natural, even though my &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; color would now be white. When I was in my teens, a hairdresser told me if I ever colored my hair, I should go red to compliment my complexion. I did, and everyone assumes I&#x27;m Irish. Blondes may have more fun, but redheads have more pizzazz, trust me on this. I use Natural Reddish Blonde, which is not always easy to find, so I&#x27;m happy to find it in triples here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, my hair is short, so I get two applications out of each box by mixing half the chemicals at a time. I save an applicator bottle for mixing and the unused portions stay tightly capped in their own bottles in between.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years and suddenly had a hard time finding the color I wanted, so I came to my favorite website (Amazon) and boom, there it was.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that it was so  dark.  Is a light &#x27;reddish strawberry blonde too a rkda&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy this color again</li>
            <li> the natural reddish blond turned out to be a darker red than the previous ones I&#x27;ve used.  the instruction stated if I wanted a lighter shade to leave the  solution on 10 mi longer but that didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find this color in stores anymore. Thanks Amazon for saving the day!!! It is a true natural looking red.</li>
