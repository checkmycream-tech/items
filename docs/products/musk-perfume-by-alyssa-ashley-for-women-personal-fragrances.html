            <li>I have enjoy this product for years.</li>
            <li>so I enjoy buying it for her.</li>
            <li>the bottle was just filled with water..</li>
            <li>Great birthday present</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light fragance</li>
            <li>- oftentimes they offer buy one, get one free promotions with free shipping over $50 -</li>
            <li>Fragrance is light, but the oil-based spray can be rubbed into the skin for a lasts-all-day effect.</li>
            <li>It is a light fragrance that does not overpower.  </li>
            <li>very rarely do I see it in stores except CVS.</li>
            <li>a fresh clean smell that appeals to most everybody.</li>
            <li>Been dousing myself with this wonderful inexpensive fragrance for years while still receiving many compliments on the subtle softness of the scent.</li>
            <li>I have used this scent for many years, it is clean, fresh and always in fashion.</li>
            <li>I am so happy to be able to find this perfume as it has become less available in my city.  </li>
            <li>A nice, mild scent which doesn&#x27;t overpower you if you have a sensitive nose!  </li>
            <li>The only scent that smells good on me.  </li>
            <li>67 y/o - People want to sit next to me because I smell so good.</li>
            <li>Brought back lots of good memories.  </li>
            <li>I have always appreciated this scent on me, and it is not flowery or overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>It is light and fresh.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance and have missed not seeing it around, my husband used to buy if for me when we were first married and even he said &amp;#34;where</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been my favorite since high school.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s virtually the only thing I&#x27;ve ever been able to wear - others are too strong and hurt my head, even if I dilute them.  </li>
            <li>This one is subtle and very pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I have used this Eau De Toilette for many years and have not been able to purchase it locally and the cost is reasonable compared to others on the market.</li>
            <li>Product looked right but contained no scent ..</li>
            <li>The product didn&#x27;t smell right though.</li>
            <li>Always getting positive comments when  I wear it!</li>
            <li>I love musk and am very particular.is no ordinary drug store gift set scent.</li>
            <li>After I put it on I don&#x27;t notice the smell after a little while, but I continue to get comments from people telling me how good I smell.  </li>
            <li>This size bottle cost more in the dept stores and to my surprise there was a smaller purse size bottle included in my purchase.</li>
            <li>I immediately looked on Amazon and found exactly what she wanted.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume, the only one I can wear that doesn&#x27;t give me a headache.  </li>
            <li>Glad I can buy a larger size online.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly as I remember it.</li>
            <li>I have used this for several years and still love the scent.</li>
            <li>I am allergic to certain smells and Alyssa Ashley is the only one I&#x27;ve been able to tolerate.</li>
            <li>This was a fairly large bottle and the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Love it as much now as I did back then</li>
            <li>This is what the wife wanted, so this is what the wife gets.&lt;br /&gt;She is very particular in the things she uses and this is one of them.</li>
            <li>Even strangers ask what perfume I&#x27;m wearing and comment that they really like it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume ~ I am sad that I  can only find it online but also happy that it hasn&#x27;t been discontinued.</li>
            <li>fast service....</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>Smells to much like baby powder</li>
            <li>I am very allergic to perfumes etc</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>She doesn&#x27;t leave the house much these days</li>
            <li>and I really wanted this cologne.</li>
            <li>I found this same sized bottle later in a local drug store and it was $15 more!!  </li>
            <li>This musk has a nicer smell to it than a lot of the other more well known names.</li>
            <li>It is hard to find Alyssa Ashley Musk, so I was thrilled to find it here, and at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>No one carries it here locally and I have loved it since I was a little girl</li>
            <li>When I break a mild sweat, it appears as if the fragrance is more noticeable and when I&#x27;m generally inactive, it&#x27;s not overwhelmingly strong.</li>
            <li>This is a difficult product to find in stores and the value was great.</li>
            <li>I love it and it is not easy to find in department stores.  </li>
            <li>very soft and feminine.  </li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s not expensive enough for the stores in the mall to carry it.  </li>
            <li>Had an old boyfriend that wore it &amp; is one of the reasons I was attracted to him!</li>
            <li>We all have different products we like to use, but this is the only one that keeps true on my skin, and doesn&#x27;t change.</li>
            <li>I love its soft, not overwhelming  fragrance.</li>
            <li>I used to buy this perfume at a certain well-known discount department store, but all of a sudden they quite carrying it.  </li>
            <li>thanks for the hard to find items being available at your website.</li>
            <li>EAU de Toilette Natural spray but</li>
            <li>Sometimes I buy directly from the Alyssa Ashley&#x27;s website</li>
            <li>Glad I at least found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this musk before and this bottle smells old.</li>
            <li>I used  this in the early 70&#x27;s...</li>
            <li>THE FRAGRANCE IS SOFT AND NOT OVERBEARNG OR OFFENCIVE</li>
            <li>My sister in law was telling me how much, and for how long she has been using this fragrance but could no longer find it anywhere.  </li>
            <li>Have used this product for many years and lately have had difficulty finding it locally.</li>
            <li>My mother is 84 and had saved the empty bottle of her favorite purfume for a few years.  </li>
            <li>YEARS AGO, BUT THE AROMA IS LIGHT AND DOESN&#x27;T LAST AS LONG AS I EXPECTED.</li>
            <li>The fragranceis subtle, easy on the nose and the wallet</li>
            <li>love this musk, its the only one I&#x27;ll use because of it&amp;#34;s subtle long lasting fragrance.</li>

            <li> Great birthday present</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light fragance</li>
            <li> - oftentimes they offer buy one, get one free promotions with free shipping over $50 -</li>
            <li> Fragrance is light, but the oil-based spray can be rubbed into the skin for a lasts-all-day effect.</li>
            <li> It is a light fragrance that does not overpower.  </li>
            <li> very rarely do I see it in stores except CVS.</li>
            <li> a fresh clean smell that appeals to most everybody.</li>
            <li> Been dousing myself with this wonderful inexpensive fragrance for years while still receiving many compliments on the subtle softness of the scent.</li>
            <li> I have used this scent for many years, it is clean, fresh and always in fashion.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to be able to find this perfume as it has become less available in my city.  </li>
            <li> A nice, mild scent which doesn&#x27;t overpower you if you have a sensitive nose!  </li>
            <li> The only scent that smells good on me.  </li>
            <li> 67 y/o - People want to sit next to me because I smell so good.</li>
            <li> Brought back lots of good memories.  </li>
            <li> I have always appreciated this scent on me, and it is not flowery or overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> It is light and fresh.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and have missed not seeing it around, my husband used to buy if for me when we were first married and even he said &amp;#34;where</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been my favorite since high school.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s virtually the only thing I&#x27;ve ever been able to wear - others are too strong and hurt my head, even if I dilute them.  </li>
            <li> This one is subtle and very pleasant.  </li>
            <li> I have used this Eau De Toilette for many years and have not been able to purchase it locally and the cost is reasonable compared to others on the market.</li>
            <li> Product looked right but contained no scent ..</li>
            <li> The product didn&#x27;t smell right though.</li>
            <li> Always getting positive comments when  I wear it!</li>
            <li> I love musk and am very particular.is no ordinary drug store gift set scent.</li>
            <li> After I put it on I don&#x27;t notice the smell after a little while, but I continue to get comments from people telling me how good I smell.  </li>
            <li> This size bottle cost more in the dept stores and to my surprise there was a smaller purse size bottle included in my purchase.</li>
            <li> I immediately looked on Amazon and found exactly what she wanted.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume, the only one I can wear that doesn&#x27;t give me a headache.  </li>
            <li> Glad I can buy a larger size online.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly as I remember it.</li>
            <li> I have used this for several years and still love the scent.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to certain smells and Alyssa Ashley is the only one I&#x27;ve been able to tolerate.</li>
            <li> This was a fairly large bottle and the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Love it as much now as I did back then</li>
            <li> This is what the wife wanted, so this is what the wife gets.&lt;br /&gt;She is very particular in the things she uses and this is one of them.</li>
            <li> Even strangers ask what perfume I&#x27;m wearing and comment that they really like it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume ~ I am sad that I  can only find it online but also happy that it hasn&#x27;t been discontinued.</li>
            <li> fast service....</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> Smells to much like baby powder</li>
            <li> I am very allergic to perfumes etc</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t leave the house much these days</li>
            <li> and I really wanted this cologne.</li>
            <li> I found this same sized bottle later in a local drug store and it was $15 more!!  </li>
            <li> This musk has a nicer smell to it than a lot of the other more well known names.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find Alyssa Ashley Musk, so I was thrilled to find it here, and at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> No one carries it here locally and I have loved it since I was a little girl</li>
            <li> When I break a mild sweat, it appears as if the fragrance is more noticeable and when I&#x27;m generally inactive, it&#x27;s not overwhelmingly strong.</li>
            <li> This is a difficult product to find in stores and the value was great.</li>
            <li> I love it and it is not easy to find in department stores.  </li>
            <li> very soft and feminine.  </li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s not expensive enough for the stores in the mall to carry it.  </li>
            <li> Had an old boyfriend that wore it &amp; is one of the reasons I was attracted to him!</li>
            <li> We all have different products we like to use, but this is the only one that keeps true on my skin, and doesn&#x27;t change.</li>
            <li> I love its soft, not overwhelming  fragrance.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this perfume at a certain well-known discount department store, but all of a sudden they quite carrying it.  </li>
            <li> thanks for the hard to find items being available at your website.</li>
            <li> EAU de Toilette Natural spray but</li>
            <li> Sometimes I buy directly from the Alyssa Ashley&#x27;s website</li>
            <li> Glad I at least found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this musk before and this bottle smells old.</li>
            <li> I used  this in the early 70&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> THE FRAGRANCE IS SOFT AND NOT OVERBEARNG OR OFFENCIVE</li>
            <li> My sister in law was telling me how much, and for how long she has been using this fragrance but could no longer find it anywhere.  </li>
            <li> Have used this product for many years and lately have had difficulty finding it locally.</li>
            <li> My mother is 84 and had saved the empty bottle of her favorite purfume for a few years.  </li>
            <li> YEARS AGO, BUT THE AROMA IS LIGHT AND DOESN&#x27;T LAST AS LONG AS I EXPECTED.</li>
            <li> The fragranceis subtle, easy on the nose and the wallet</li>
            <li> love this musk, its the only one I&#x27;ll use because of it&amp;#34;s subtle long lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> She had been looking for this for a long time.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, the only other scent I wear at all is Vanilla Orange Blossom Oil by Sun&#x27;s Eye.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find for a decent price online and</li>
            <li> long lasting and a little goes a long way!!</li>
            <li> Also, it had a little travel-sized bottle attached to the outside of the package!  </li>
            <li> It was actually introduced in the late 60&#x27;s, and was sold in a smaller heart shaped bottle.  </li>
            <li> It had become harder to find in retail stores, so when I fould</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had this perfume in awhile since it is not available in local stores anymore.  </li>
            <li> Getting harder to find except on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> but they no longer have it or any other stores to my knowledge.  </li>
            <li> Price is way cheaper than other on-line suppliers.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is subtle and long lasting.</li>
            <li> It used to come in a black bottle..</li>
            <li> She has used it for several years, but is unable to obtain it locally.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve had trouble with perfumes because they&#x27;re overpowering on you or because they give you a headache as soon as you put them on, try this one.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this and when it came I was very shocked to find out that it was the biggest bottle available!  </li>
            <li> A blast from the past.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in the stores</li>
            <li> I get lots of &amp;#34;You smell good&amp;#34; compliments and it is so hard to find.  </li>
            <li> Wore this as a teenager in the late 60s...</li>
            <li> I think this scent can be stronger on some and subtle on others.</li>
            <li> and I would receive at least 4-5 compliments on it just about every week, some even from men!</li>
            <li> Something is wrong.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed there was hardly any scent.</li>
            <li> I was afraid they didn&#x27;t make it anymore</li>
            <li> bad deal... do not buy!!I bought a bottle of Alyssa Ashley  Musk 3.4 oz.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> God knows when a fragrance is not tolerable, it is the worst smell.</li>

            <li> I used to buy this perfume at a certain well-known discount department store, but all of a sudden they quite carrying it.  I looked all over town... I guess it&#x27;s not expensive enough for the stores in the mall to carry it.  Anyway... I ordered this and when it came I was very shocked to find out that it was the biggest bottle available!  Also, it had a little travel-sized bottle attached to the outside of the package!  I found this same sized bottle later in a local drug store and it was $15 more!!  Great buy!!</li>
            <li> I am so happy to be able to find this perfume as it has become less available in my city.  It is also a great price.</li>
            <li> A blast from the past. I liked it.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome and received quickly</li>
            <li> My mom has been using this since I was a baby so I enjoy buying it for her. It&#x27;s hard to find for a decent price online and very rarely do I see it in stores except CVS. I personally love the smell, but I grew up with it so I am biased.</li>
            <li> Product looked right but contained no scent .. just water... bad deal... do not buy!!I bought a bottle of Alyssa Ashley  Musk 3.4 oz. EAU de Toilette Natural spray but the bottle was just filled with water.. I&#x27;ll never order from Amazon.com again</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my aunt who has worn the fragrance for many years.</li>
            <li> I have used Alyssa Ashley Musk for years and all of a sudden I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere! I am allergic to certain smells and Alyssa Ashley is the only one I&#x27;ve been able to tolerate. I really love the scent! I decided to check Amazon and there it was and at a good price also!</li>
            <li> I always get along of compliments .  They always a ask what i am wearing.  Hard to find in the stores</li>
            <li> A nice, mild scent which doesn&#x27;t overpower you if you have a sensitive nose!  Also, try spraying your clothes instead of your skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this for about 15 years and it&#x27;s great. This fragrance is subtle and long lasting. The aroma is pleasing to both men and women. God knows when a fragrance is not tolerable, it is the worst smell. I like that it seems as if the fragrance plays off your body chemistry. When I break a mild sweat, it appears as if the fragrance is more noticeable and when I&#x27;m generally inactive, it&#x27;s not overwhelmingly strong. Just try it....</li>
            <li> Great birthday present</li>
            <li> The only scent that smells good on me.  I get lots of &amp;#34;You smell good&amp;#34; compliments and it is so hard to find.  Great service and very prompt!  Thank you.</li>

            <li> I have used this product for 15 plus years.  the quality is always the same, and something I count on.  It had become harder to find in retail stores, so when I fould I could order on Amazon, I was very pleased.  We all have different products we like to use, but this is the only one that keeps true on my skin, and doesn&#x27;t change.</li>

            <li> fast service....great product</li>

            <li> Arrived just as described.</li>

            <li> i have order this many times.</li>
            <li> This is the only perfume I can wear and have been wearing for the last 30 years.  I can&#x27;t wear anything that I can smell or it will give me a headache.  After I put it on I don&#x27;t notice the smell after a little while, but I continue to get comments from people telling me how good I smell.  Sometimes local stores will stop carrying it, but eventually it comes back.  I don&#x27;t know what I would do if I couldn&#x27;t find it.</li>
            <li> I love musk and am very particular.is no ordinary drug store gift set scent.</li>
            <li> a fresh clean smell that appeals to most everybody. refreshing! long lasting and a little goes a long way!! a pleasing sex appeal!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I found this amazing perfume ! It&#x27;s been my favorite since high school. I&#x27;m often asked about what perfume that I&#x27;m wearing even by some guys ! I appreciate being able to find it on Amazon. It&#x27;s a light fragance but it&#x27;s one that I&#x27;d recommend to any lady !</li>
            <li> I used to wear this fragrance and loved it. I was afraid they didn&#x27;t make it anymore so I&#x27;m very excited to have found it! Love it as much now as I did back then</li>

            <li> I love all Alyssa Ashley products!!</li>
            <li> A very pleasant scent that is not too strong. The dispenser always works -- I have never had a problem with it. I have been using this scent for years.</li>
            <li> A gift for my wife - something she loves - can&#x27;t find it locally so made her day - and you know what they say, the world&#x27;s good when momma&#x27;s happy!</li>
            <li> I have used this for 30 yrs and I like it better than the ones you pay hundreds an ounce for</li>
            <li> I DON&#x27;T KNOW IF THEY CHANGED SINCE I USED YEARS AGO, BUT THE AROMA IS LIGHT AND DOESN&#x27;T LAST AS LONG AS I EXPECTED.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my favorite perfume. You have the best deals always on products that I use.</li>
            <li> I have used Alyssa Ashley Musk for a number of years.  I once preferred Estee Lauder&#x27;s &amp;#34;White Linen&amp;#34;, but the price for a much smaller bottle than the 3.4 oz. of Alyssa Ashley is 3 1/2 times the price.  Also, I get many compliments on the fragrance!!!!!</li>
            <li> Imma guy and i wear this all of the time.. Men and women always ask me what kinda cologne is it</li>
            <li> Fair price, rapid delivery, and as usual, happy to make purchases at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> My favorite! Came quickly and at a great price.</li>
            <li> I have used Alyssa Ashley Musk for years.  I am very allergic to perfumes etc but this product has been great.  So many compliments on the scent.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this product for years. Love it. She gets lots of compliments. I will order again.</li>
            <li> Used Alyssa Ashley&#x27;s Musk for many years. The only perfume that I use. Love it and am so glad you offer it through Amazon and in Prime. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Since I first smelled this I have loved it! I have been wearing this scent for more then 20 years!(man I feel old!!)It is musk at it&#x27;s best. I think this scent can be stronger on some and subtle on others. If you like the way musk smells on you then I think you will like this lovely perfume!</li>
            <li> My 84 year old mother had a empty bottle of this perfume and didn&#x27;t know where to tell me to look for it.  I immediately looked on Amazon and found exactly what she wanted.  It&#x27;s definately not the kind of smell I like but that is what she likes.  This was a fairly large bottle and the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I have worn this perfume for over 20 years.  I love it!  I get headaches from many perfumes.  This one is subtle and very pleasant.  I always get compliments on how good I smell.  It&#x27;s not one of those floral scents that gag everyone around you.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume, the only one I can wear that doesn&#x27;t give me a headache.  Glad I can buy a larger size online.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> This is a hard to find perfume that is my favorite and delicious.</li>
            <li> I have used this scent for many years, it is clean, fresh and always in fashion. My husband loves it too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;v used this perfume for years and JUST LOVE IT!!!!!  One of my perfume staples!!!  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is probably not the fault of the perfume, but it wasn&#x27;t as I remembered it when I wore it many years ago.</li>
            <li> I have been using their Eau de Toilette spray and Hand &amp; Body Moisturiser Lotion products for decades. I&#x27;ve never come across any fragrance that smells as exquisite or gets as much attention as this one ... I am 67 y/o - People want to sit next to me because I smell so good. Sometimes I buy directly from the Alyssa Ashley&#x27;s website - oftentimes they offer buy one, get one free promotions with free shipping over $50 - plus if you sign up for their newsletter, you&#x27;ll get 20% off your total order too.</li>
            <li> I think they make it milder that they used to in the 1970&#x27;s. Not as concentrated a scent, but it still smells really good on me. I used to buy it at Walgreen but they no longer have it or any other stores to my knowledge.  Glad I at least found it on Amazon. Much more expensive than back in the day, of course. Btw, it&#x27;s for men &amp; women. It&#x27;s a musk. Had an old boyfriend that wore it &amp; is one of the reasons I was attracted to him! He smelled so good.</li>
            <li> gift that my daughter loves.</li>
            <li> No issues ordering or with time it took to arrive. The product didn&#x27;t smell right though. I&#x27;ve used this musk before and this bottle smells old.</li>
            <li> Wore this as a teenager in the late 60s...love it..very soft and feminine.  Brought back lots of good memories.  Can&#x27;t believe they still make it!  It used to come in a black bottle..</li>
            <li> Ordered on a whim - I like musk scents.  Will order again!</li>
            <li> I used  this in the early 70&#x27;s... it was my fave... I guess my body chemistry has changed... it doesn&#x27;t smell the same to me .... I don&#x27;t care for it now..</li>
            <li> Used it for years .Smells good but not to strong .Not offensive like some colones.Gives you a suttle sent love the clean smell.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had this perfume in awhile since it is not available in local stores anymore.  A relative told me she buys it here so I now have some again.  It&#x27;s exactly as I remember it.</li>
            <li> I love my perfume. I have used this for several years and still love the scent. The price is also good.</li>
            <li> My mother is 84 and had saved the empty bottle of her favorite purfume for a few years.  She doesn&#x27;t leave the house much these days and I asked her to let me see if I could find it for her. I looked everywhere and could not find it in my area so went on line.  She could not believe that I had found it for her and was so delighted to get it.  Made my Christmas to see her so happy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why the Product Description says this was introduced in 1992.  It was actually introduced in the late 60&#x27;s, and was sold in a smaller heart shaped bottle.  I have been wearing this since 1977 and it&#x27;s my favorite bottled perfume.  As a matter of fact, the only other scent I wear at all is Vanilla Orange Blossom Oil by Sun&#x27;s Eye.  I have been hoarding the 3 bottles I found 5 years ago of Alyssa Ashley&#x27;s Musk because I was told they were going out of business.  Today I decided to look online to see if anybody had any stockpiled somewhere, and to my amazement, it&#x27;s sold in many places!  Thank God!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing.  This used to be sold as a unisex scent, hence the male/female logo on the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥I love this scent and always have♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥</li>
            <li> I Have been using this for years and always get compliments. The fragranceis subtle, easy on the nose and the wallet</li>
            <li> I like it but prefer the concentrated better.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED ALYSSA ASHLEY FOR OVER 30 YEARS I WOULDN&#x27;T USE ANYTHING ELSE THE FRAGRANCE IS SOFT AND NOT OVERBEARNG OR OFFENCIVE I HAVE A LOT OF ALLGERIES AND THIS HAS NEVER BOTHERED ME I HAVE HEARD A LOT OF &amp;#34;YOU SMELL GOOD &amp;#34; COMENTS I HOPE THEY NEVER QUIT MAKING IT</li>
            <li> I purchase this every year for my daughter because we cannnot get it locally. her favorite perfume. thanks for the hard to find items being available at your website.</li>
            <li> Excellent I recommended to everybody</li>
            <li> Still love this stuff!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve had trouble with perfumes because they&#x27;re overpowering on you or because they give you a headache as soon as you put them on, try this one.  It&#x27;s virtually the only thing I&#x27;ve ever been able to wear - others are too strong and hurt my head, even if I dilute them.  Alyssa Ashley Musk has worked for me for over 25 years.  I hope they never stop making it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this perfume! No one carries it here locally and I have loved it since I was a little girl and it was worn by my mom! Love love love it! So glad I could find it here!</li>
            <li> This is what the wife wanted, so this is what the wife gets.&lt;br /&gt;She is very particular in the things she uses and this is one of them.</li>
            <li> I layer the musk with Ciara perfume.  Apply once in the morning and I am good for the day.  Have had many compliments.  Have used the two together for many years.  Guess you could call it my &#x27;signature smell&#x27; :)</li>
            <li> This is a Christmas present for a friend of mine.  She has used it for several years, but is unable to obtain it locally.  It was sent undamaged and in plenty of time.  I know she will like it.</li>
            <li> I had been ordering this from another on-line merchant for years. When I discovered that I could get it through Amazon I was thrilled. I immediately ordered 2 bottles. They arrived on time and in excellent shape, with bubble-packing to prevent breakage. Price is way cheaper than other on-line suppliers. Fragrance is light, but the oil-based spray can be rubbed into the skin for a lasts-all-day effect. I always get compliments when I wear this fragrance. It&#x27;s one of my all-time favorites.</li>
            <li> This musk has a nicer smell to it than a lot of the other more well known names. Plus the amazon price was way better than what I paid in town. I bought a 1.7 oz bottle for $20 at Sears and got a 3.4 oz bottle on amazon for $23</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this for  thirty years and continues to get many compliments.  It is a light fragrance that does not overpower.  Getting harder to find except on Amazon.  Great price.</li>
            <li> Been  using this perfume  for the last 40 years! Light perfect scent. Always getting positive comments when  I wear it!</li>
            <li> I get this for my wife each Christmas and it is her favorite perfume.  I&#x27;ve been doing it for years so it&#x27;s a tradition.  The package arrived in two days and in perfect condition.  I love Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this same perfume for over 26 years.  My husband is allergic and this one doesn&#x27;t bother him.  I always get compliments on it.</li>
            <li> I have worn this musk exclusively for years. I love its soft, not overwhelming  fragrance. I used to work as a cashier at a well known national drug store chain and I would receive at least 4-5 compliments on it just about every week, some even from men! I never thought I&#x27;d be a &#x27;one fragrance woman&#x27; but this one did it for me.</li>
            <li> Wonderful light fragrance that I wore when I was younger. Was so happy to find it on amazon!! Great find!</li>
            <li> I have always appreciated this scent on me, and it is not flowery or overwhelming.  I have used this Eau De Toilette for many years and have not been able to purchase it locally and the cost is reasonable compared to others on the market.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and she was so happy with it. She had been looking for this for a long time. It was prime and came just in time.</li>
            <li> my GIRLFRIEND HAS BEEN USING THIS FOR YEARS,WE COULDNT FIND IT IN ANY STORES HERE.AMAZON IS A LIFESAVER, THANK YOU.</li>
            <li> Something is wrong. I ordered this months ago and it took me back to the &amp;#34;old days&amp;#34; . I reordered and this is NOT the same scent at all. So disappointed. My birthday is tomorrow and I really wanted this cologne. I&#x27;ll have to reorder it from some reputable source. It doesn&#x27;t even smell musky.</li>
            <li> love this musk, its the only one I&#x27;ll use because of it&amp;#34;s subtle long lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> My sister in law was telling me how much, and for how long she has been using this fragrance but could no longer find it anywhere.  So I pulled up Amazon and there it was.  She was visiting from out of state so by the time she reached home the package was awaiting her on her front porch.  She was thrilled.</li>
            <li> Get compliments all the time on his fragrance</li>
            <li> i bought this product for ny wife for christmas,she loves it.and she smells wonderful when she weares it.thanks alot. i will soon buy more.</li>
