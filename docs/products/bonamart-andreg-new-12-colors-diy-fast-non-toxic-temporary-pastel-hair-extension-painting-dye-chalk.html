    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It is perfect for Halloween and scaring your grandchildren</li>
            <li>Very happy!</li>
            <li>I gave my daughter some red-white-and-blue streaks in her hair with this chalk and it turned out great.</li>
            <li>Good item for the price.</li>
            <li>We saw these chalks at a fair but they wanted $25.  </li>
            <li>Either way, the colors are great, and the wetter your hair, the more pigmented it&#x27;ll be.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and the color stays bright until you wash it out.</li>
            <li>Maybe everybody knew that but me. :)</li>
            <li>it three or more weeks</li>
            <li>I thought it would be better .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to apply (except the tips,</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s kind of tough) and looks great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap chalk</li>
            <li>Pros: love having fun hair</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Cons: gets all over your hands easily and stains so wash  fast</li>
            <li>I ran each chalk stick under a little water right before applying and it went on her hair great.</li>
            <li>it comes right off once you wash your hair.</li>
            <li>, if your going swimming this stuff will come right out, and after you finish your hair if you brush your fingers</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve definitely used better hair chalks.</li>
            <li>The chalk came and looks exactly like it does in the picture, and was packaged well</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe mine are just dried out and not any good anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Out</li>
            <li>Thanks anyway.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work  </li>
            <li>The color doesn&#x27;t show up very well.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t get everywhere, stayed in her hair and washed out after a couple of washings (the red was a bit more persistent but the blue came right out).</li>
            <li>I really love the colors, but your hair must be very wet for the lighter colors to show up.</li>
            <li>More difficult than I thought it would be and color isn&#x27;t as bright in the hair as expected but still fun for my daughter to play with.</li>
            <li>New 12 Colors DIY Fast Non-toxic Temporary Pastel Hair Extension Painting - review</li>
            <li>A previous comment stated wetting the chalk--they probably would have worked better if I had done the same.  </li>
            <li>Looks good when but difficult to wash out.</li>
            <li>but I use the chalk when my hair is wet and when it dries it dries vibrant colors!</li>
            <li>; chalk/pastel is way too hard too use; tried with water, better but color doesn&#x27;t show very much on dark hair;  </li>
            <li>My daughter had fun, but it was hard to apply without getting all over the place.</li>

            <li> I have used hair chalk before.  This sticks are very tough.  A previous comment stated wetting the chalk--they probably would have worked better if I had done the same.  However, I have never had to wet hair chalk before and did not expect to have to do it with this chalk.</li>
            <li> I gave my daughter some red-white-and-blue streaks in her hair with this chalk and it turned out great. I ran each chalk stick under a little water right before applying and it went on her hair great. Even the white showed up in her blonde hair. It didn&#x27;t get everywhere, stayed in her hair and washed out after a couple of washings (the red was a bit more persistent but the blue came right out). Love it!</li>
            <li> Tried everything.  Followed Directions, tried internet tips.  This stuff is no different that pastel coloring chalks for artists.  DO NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL.</li>
            <li> Good item for the price. More difficult than I thought it would be and color isn&#x27;t as bright in the hair as expected but still fun for my daughter to play with.</li>
            <li> This will damage your hair, they did not work... not with wet hair not with dry hair. You have to scrub to hard that it will destroy your hair. no good</li>
            <li> Turns out this is just a box of art pastels, but they do work for their declared purpose.  Maybe everybody knew that but me. :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I can change my hair color every day if I want to. It&#x27;s really easy to apply (except the tips, that&#x27;s kind of tough) and looks great!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my two girls and tried it on them&lt;br /&gt;As well as myself. Goes on rather easy but horrible to try to brush through your hair after and chalk dust goes everywhere! Your hair feels like string waste if money</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know.haven&#x27;t got it yet.ordered it three or more weeks ago.haven&#x27;t water this long for anything I&#x27;ve ordered from Amazon.</li>
            <li> We saw these chalks at a fair but they wanted $25.  I found them on Amazon for a 1/4 of the price.  The kids like to color their hair it comes right off once you wash your hair.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get enough color to come off no matter what tricks I try. All it does is the chalk breaks in half and my hair breaks as I rub the chalk on it back and fourth trying to get color out of them.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe mine are just dried out and not any good anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Out of approximately the last fifty things I have bought from Amazon (I have to do the majority of my shopping online) this is one of the two worst products I actually regret buying.</li>
            <li> New 12 Colors DIY Fast Non-toxic Temporary Pastel Hair Extension Painting - review; chalk/pastel is way too hard too use; tried with water, better but color doesn&#x27;t show very much on dark hair;  it&#x27; not paint-on</li>
            <li> These chalks require a lot of elbow grease to get a dang color in your hair. I&#x27;ve definitely used better hair chalks. For the price though, eh. What do you expect. Ah well. Thanks anyway.</li>
            <li> color doesnt stay long. Tried putting water wetting hair, etc. but nothing. But its ok, ill find a way to use it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and the color stays bright until you wash it out. It is perfect for Halloween and scaring your grandchildren</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work  so I got dissapointed with this product how it worked I thought it would be better .</li>
            <li> The description says hair chalk but I received artists&#x27; pastels. It even says so on the packaging, but because the product LOOKS like the picture, they won&#x27;t let me return them.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything. I can&#x27;t get any color on my daughters hair. Very disappointed. How do you return something back to china without breaking the bank?  No instructions were included. No information or ingredient, nothing.  Will amazon take the responsibility if the product is recalled?</li>
            <li> These are th coolest things ever! I have dirty blonde hair so it&#x27;s a bit darker but I use the chalk when my hair is wet and when it dries it dries vibrant colors! It&#x27;s cheap chalk but hey it works so y not use it!?</li>
            <li> My daughter had fun, but it was hard to apply without getting all over the place. Seemed to be extremely drying to the hair.</li>
            <li> Pros: love having fun hair&lt;br /&gt;Cons: gets all over your hands easily and stains so wash  fast, if your going swimming this stuff will come right out, and after you finish your hair if you brush your fingers say to itch your head or your kids touch your hair at any point everyone&#x27;s hands.  Likewise if you lay on the couch your pillows will turn the color you used.</li>
            <li> too powdery, gets on clothes and skin, just not easy as imagined.</li>
            <li> The chalk came and looks exactly like it does in the picture, and was packaged well so it wasn&#x27;t broken. I really love the colors, but your hair must be very wet for the lighter colors to show up. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the chalk, or the flat ironing I do afterwards, but my hair gets very... static-y as well. Either way, the colors are great, and the wetter your hair, the more pigmented it&#x27;ll be. Very happy!</li>
            <li> The color doesn&#x27;t show up very well. I even tried following the directions for darker hair. We used it for Halloween and haven&#x27;t used it again since.</li>
            <li> Looks good when but difficult to wash out. Would buy again.</li>
