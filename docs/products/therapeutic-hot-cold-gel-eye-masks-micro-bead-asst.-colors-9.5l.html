            <li>I ordered these and gifted them to my husband and son because they were always wearing mine.</li>
            <li>I love this therapeutic hot/cold gel eye mask.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s huge and covers most of my forehead and temples.</li>
            <li>This product would be much better if it made a tighter fit around the eyes.</li>
            <li>Since I frequently get migraines, I decided to purchase the Gel Eye Mask which has been amazing!</li>
            <li>The item feels cheap</li>
            <li>Needed it for the bags under my eyes but the ice was on my brow the sides of my eye didn&#x27;t fit well under my eye..</li>
            <li>(I was looking for something primarily for under eye puffiness).</li>
            <li>Especially saturday mornings it will alleviate your swollen face after a good night out of chasing women in limousines.</li>
            <li>I have MS, so staying cool is a must, my bf has Diabetes</li>
            <li>The velcro gets stuck in my hair sometimes, but other than that this is a great product.</li>
            <li>For my needs I just kept it in the refrigerator, wore it until it was luke warm, put it back in the frig, and then wore it again in an hour.</li>
            <li>The mask is nice, it does its job but clearly following the color in the pic</li>
            <li>I wish this was made bigger, though it&#x27;s still nice.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll need to break up the frost and make the mask pliable before wearing, but overall a nice product.</li>
            <li>Also he can barely use it for more than a minute, it literally gives him brain freeze.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s because I have a huge nose, but this thing doesn&#x27;t come in direct contact with the area under my eyes.</li>
            <li>They arrived within the specified time frame, exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I do have to admit I&#x27;ve never used it in the hot capacity though.</li>
            <li>I do really like it.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had a real opportunity to try these for any length of time.  </li>
            <li>Very comforting  and soothing to your face.  </li>
            <li>Really appreciated</li>
            <li>; portion of my eye due to the nature of the human eye socket, however, keeping it as it&#x27;s good for a tension headache.  </li>
            <li>It needs a redesign where a bulging portion the size... of an eyebag protrudes so it can make decent contact with said area.</li>
            <li>and you have to press the insides in to touch your eyelids (closer to the nose), but a decent product for the price.</li>
            <li>The thing is that the nose part isn&#x27;t open enough to get closer eye bags (is that the correct term?), it does help the swelling bellow my eyes, but if it could get closer it would do much more.</li>
            <li>Even after getting it reasonably heated, it cooled  off so quickly it was of little help.</li>
            <li>When frozen, the gel doesn&#x27;t stay soft.</li>
            <li>dont like the plastic band hurt my ears... and doesnt stay cool long enough , maybe like 4-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>So by the time my eyes are nice and chilled, the rest of my face is rather uncomfortably</li>
            <li>So if I wear it for long enough it will eventually chill that area, but it&#x27;s really annoying because I can fit a whole finger between the area on the side of my nose, where most of my under-eye area is.</li>
            <li>I really think my money was well spent!</li>

            <li> I really think my money was well spent!</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is that it doesn&#x27;t lie flat around your nose, so the inner eye area and cheek area aren&#x27;t covered.</li>
            <li> I use it when I wake up from a long nap to reduce puffiness</li>
            <li> I thought it would be blue, turned out pink.</li>
            <li> Got this for a friend who had a minor surgery.</li>
            <li> The cheap design has somewhat sharp edges that make it uncomfortable when one of the edges is resting on your skin...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine, but doesn&#x27;t stay cold very long</li>
            <li> an is fun but dosnt stay cold for long even when left in over night</li>
            <li> it cracks and little blue gels fallout.</li>
            <li> let it sit for about a minute on the counter while the harsh freeze thaws just a little so that your skin can tolerate the direct coldness.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine the cheap material holding up to well with the shock of heat and cold.</li>
            <li> So, thanks bateman and thnx amazon, I have business cards to produce as I&#x27;m lacking behind.</li>
            <li> it does, it works as expected.</li>
            <li> Broke a few days later.</li>
            <li> So far I have only used it as a cold pack; which has definitely reduced swelling and stopped migraines.</li>
            <li> But a word of warning to other men out there like me who get their beauty advice from horror movies: do not freeze this thing and then try to wear it.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s pretty lame.</li>
            <li> It might be useful as a cold compress to decrease the appearance of swollen eyes</li>
            <li> but there has to be some sort of thin layer which can cover your eyes in their entirety so that you may feel completely relaxed.</li>
            <li> However, the mask fits well, doesn&#x27;t slide down your face unless you,re a vase at which point you shouldn&#x27;t be wearing a mask anyway.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t heat evenly in the microwave - one side was too hot while the other too cold.</li>
            <li> or less.</li>
            <li> This eye mask was of little use.</li>
            <li> I have only used it for cold and not hot</li>
            <li> so he is always cold, but I can wear these to bed or to watch TV and my internal body temperature goes down.  </li>
            <li> It cold only a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes of obtaining relief from painful sinus pressure without taking medications that cause jitters.</li>
            <li> life is hard, guys.</li>
            <li> I also wish the cold would last a bit longer.</li>
            <li> With all the negative things I had to say about it, it still gets the job done albeit a bit</li>
            <li> Works well but only stays cold for about 10 minutes</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t mean you get it?</li>
            <li> I mean I used this product</li>
            <li> ridiculous requirement</li>
            <li> I use it to relieve headaches and sinus pressure by chilling it in the fridge and then placing it on my forehead.</li>
            <li> When plastic gets cold from freezer</li>
            <li> ...........I don&#x27;t have the required words, that is annoying,</li>

            <li> does not even touch under eye area.</li>
            <li> Love these. Warn them up for 15 seconds in the microwave. Great for spa day at home. Feels great on sinuses.</li>
            <li> Thank u this works good</li>
            <li> I do really like it. It&#x27;s really nice because it has a strap to hold it on.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make good contact with the &amp;#34;eye bag&amp;#34; portion of my eye due to the nature of the human eye socket, however, keeping it as it&#x27;s good for a tension headache.  It needs a redesign where a bulging portion the size... of an eyebag protrudes so it can make decent contact with said area.</li>
            <li> Nice product, velcro feels kind of cheap and you have to press the insides in to touch your eyelids (closer to the nose), but a decent product for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine, but doesn&#x27;t stay cold very long...........I don&#x27;t have the required words, that is annoying, ridiculous requirement, I can&#x27;t  this</li>
            <li> Mine has a lot of beads inside. It&#x27;s huge and covers most of my forehead and temples. The only issue I have is that it doesn&#x27;t lie flat around your nose, so the inner eye area and cheek area aren&#x27;t covered. I do freeze it and it works great.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes of obtaining relief from painful sinus pressure without taking medications that cause jitters. This eye mask was of little use. It doesn&#x27;t heat evenly in the microwave - one side was too hot while the other too cold. Even after getting it reasonably heated, it cooled  off so quickly it was of little help. It might be useful as a cold compress to decrease the appearance of swollen eyes but that is a cosmetic benefit only.</li>
            <li> dont like the plastic band hurt my ears... and doesnt stay cool long enough , maybe like 4-5 minutes. or less.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product, it removes my puffy eyes &amp; it also helps with my headaches</li>
            <li> It was a good buy! I really think my money was well spent! I&#x27;m really happy for the item I bought!</li>
            <li> I wish I could give 2.5 stars. I like it and dislike it...The thing is that the nose part isn&#x27;t open enough to get closer eye bags (is that the correct term?), it does help the swelling bellow my eyes, but if it could get closer it would do much more. ( look at my hack!)</li>
            <li> I recently had upper eye lid surgery and used this to help with the swelling. PERFECT! If you are going to put it in the freezer let it sit for about a minute on the counter while the harsh freeze thaws just a little so that your skin can tolerate the direct coldness. For my needs I just kept it in the refrigerator, wore it until it was luke warm, put it back in the frig, and then wore it again in an hour.</li>
            <li> Yes, I&#x27;m also one of the fools who bought this thing because of a cat-killing psychopath begging for attention. However, the mask fits well, doesn&#x27;t slide down your face unless you,re a vase at which point you shouldn&#x27;t be wearing a mask anyway. Especially saturday mornings it will alleviate your swollen face after a good night out of chasing women in limousines. So, thanks bateman and thnx amazon, I have business cards to produce as I&#x27;m lacking behind.</li>
            <li> Great price point for this product and fast shipping... I use it when I wake up from a long nap to reduce puffiness</li>
            <li> This product would be much better if it made a tighter fit around the eyes.</li>
            <li> I have MS, so staying cool is a must, my bf has Diabetes so he is always cold, but I can wear these to bed or to watch TV and my internal body temperature goes down.  They are great!</li>
            <li> It cold only a few minutes.</li>
            <li> The item feels cheap and I wish I had found a better alternative. The cheap design has somewhat sharp edges that make it uncomfortable when one of the edges is resting on your skin... namely resting on your ears and nose. I also wish the cold would last a bit longer. With all the negative things I had to say about it, it still gets the job done albeit a bit uncomfortably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should point out that I have not used it for heat yet, I can&#x27;t imagine the cheap material holding up to well with the shock of heat and cold.</li>
            <li> Works well but only stays cold for about 10 minutes</li>
            <li> Needed it for the bags under my eyes but the ice was on my brow the sides of my eye didn&#x27;t fit well under my eye..&lt;br /&gt;Ice all around the eye was unbearable</li>
            <li> The mask is nice, it does its job but clearly following the color in the pic doesn&#x27;t mean you get it? No option for that. I wish I knew cause it was a gift. Since I couldn&#x27;t give it away I kept it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a real opportunity to try these for any length of time.  We chilled them and that was nice.  How do you heat them?  I didn&#x27;t get that part of the directions as the kids cleaned up and threw that part out.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be blue, turned out pink. Got it was a gift for my fiancee who always complains about puffy under eyes. Also he can barely use it for more than a minute, it literally gives him brain freeze.</li>
            <li> Actually it&#x27;s work...I mean I used this product n I feel better. .</li>
            <li> I bought one at my local dollar tree it works well an is fun but dosnt stay cold for long even when left in over night thats why i give it 3 stars</li>
            <li> Liked it but there has to be some sort of thin layer which can cover your eyes in their entirety so that you may feel completely relaxed.</li>
            <li> After having eyelid surgery, I needed something to reduce swelling. The doctor recommended a bag of peas, but I knew I needed something better. Since I frequently get migraines, I decided to purchase the Gel Eye Mask which has been amazing! So far I have only used it as a cold pack; which has definitely reduced swelling and stopped migraines.</li>
            <li> Broke 1st day. When plastic gets cold from freezer it cracks and little blue gels fallout.</li>
            <li> Worked ok but not great!</li>
            <li> I got one of these because I saw Patrick Bateman wearing it at the beginning of American Psycho, and I was like &amp;#34;yeah, that will fix my eye puffiness after a night of drinking&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it does, it works as expected. But a word of warning to other men out there like me who get their beauty advice from horror movies: do not freeze this thing and then try to wear it. It hurts. Just keep it in the refrigerator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I don&#x27;t like, I don&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s because I have a huge nose, but this thing doesn&#x27;t come in direct contact with the area under my eyes. So if I wear it for long enough it will eventually chill that area, but it&#x27;s really annoying because I can fit a whole finger between the area on the side of my nose, where most of my under-eye area is. So by the time my eyes are nice and chilled, the rest of my face is rather uncomfortably cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A slice of cucumber from the refrigerator does not have this problem, but then I don&#x27;t get to run around the apartment pretending to be Patrick Bateman&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*sigh* life is hard, guys. #FirstWorldProblems</li>
            <li> bridge is too low, will not sit on face below eyes - which is the point.</li>
            <li> After 3 uses part of the edge ripped and the gel beads fall out now when it thaws. I have to staple it to fix it. That&#x27;s pretty lame. But I like the eye mask itself. It makes my face feel fresher ad younger.</li>
            <li> Very nice when heated.</li>
            <li> When frozen, the gel doesn&#x27;t stay soft.</li>
            <li> I wish this was made bigger, though it&#x27;s still nice. You&#x27;ll need to break up the frost and make the mask pliable before wearing, but overall a nice product.</li>
            <li> Good I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> My father has clogged tear ducts and it has done wonders for his eyes.</li>
            <li> Very comforting  and soothing to your face.  I have only used it for cold and not hot but it has worked to my expectations.</li>
            <li> I ordered these and gifted them to my husband and son because they were always wearing mine. They arrived within the specified time frame, exactly as described. I love this therapeutic hot/cold gel eye mask. I use it to relieve headaches and sinus pressure by chilling it in the fridge and then placing it on my forehead. It feels great on the eyes where it&#x27;s supposed to be as well. The velcro gets stuck in my hair sometimes, but other than that this is a great product. I do have to admit I&#x27;ve never used it in the hot capacity though.</li>
            <li> This was a present. My friend asked for this by nsme</li>
            <li> Way bigger than it needs to be. (I was looking for something primarily for under eye puffiness). The plastic dug into my skin.</li>
            <li> Broke a few days later.</li>
            <li> Got this for a friend who had a minor surgery. Really appreciated</li>
