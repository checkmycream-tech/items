            <li>Good job, Mary Kay -- thanks a BUNCH.</li>
            <li>Mary Kay has discontinued most of their original line of face care products, including this one.</li>
            <li>it is light and leaves your face clean and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>It is so gentle on your skin and takes care of all the makeup pretty easily.</li>
            <li>have used product for many years and cleans well and does not dry out my skin in the winter or summer</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t have breakouts and my skin is soft and clean looking and feeling.</li>
            <li>Been using this for years, skin always feels clean and refreshed, not greasy OR dried Out... love this -</li>
            <li>This product must be very old - on top of that this person is charging double what it used to cost.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>so I am trying to get it as much as I can</li>
            <li>It gently yet totally takes away all traces of make-up, leaving my face feeling so clean.</li>
            <li>top of that -- within two weeks or less of using the Timewise</li>
            <li>I do not like the new one</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Its not right that in the morning when I am getting ready to cleanse that</li>
            <li>this cleanser doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling tight and yet it removes makeup very well.</li>

            <li> Both of these products have worked well for me over the past 20 years.</li>
            <li> It has served me well for approximately 16 years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sad that Mary Kay get this product out of market.</li>
            <li> I hate to see it go.</li>

            <li> This is undoubtedly the absolutely best cleanser I have ever used.  However, it&#x27;s my understanding that this item has been discontinued from Mary Kay&#x27;s line.
