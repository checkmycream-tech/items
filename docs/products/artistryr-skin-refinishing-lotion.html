    <ol>
            <li>Beautiful!</li>
            <li>I could have given it 5 stars if my skin would have become perfect.</li>
            <li>Excellent product but a bit pricey for 1 oz.  </li>
            <li>Even when I don&#x27;t use it in combination with the Microdermabration gel, it still works great!</li>
            <li>Blends perfectly to my skin !</li>
            <li>Oh and it also smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>this is the best ive ever tried!</li>
            <li>I can honestly say this is one of the best, if not the best, moisturizer I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>This product had great reviews</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!.....</li>
            <li>I love this lotion it makes my skin feel like velvet and smells wonderful....</li>
            <li>Good seller.</li>
            <li>The most amazing lotion I have ever put on my face!</li>
            <li>Certainly a top of the line product!</li>
            <li>soooo many things!....</li>
            <li>so I thought it would be amazing</li>
            <li>Makes your skin so smooth, feels great.  </li>
            <li>Very lightweight and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>It is an effective system.  </li>
            <li>Love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>It is okay</li>
            <li>I do wish it were a bit more hydrating - within minutes of putting it on</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells</li>
            <li>However, once I run out the cream, I will probably look for a more cost-effective system that works well.</li>
            <li>I put on an SPF moisturizer on top of it and realized the product made the SPF moisturizer worked better on my face as well.</li>
            <li>Great product my skin feels so soft and smooth</li>
            <li>Cream does a great job, but its a different version than what&#x27;s described, so I returned it.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>I began using this microdermabrasion system after a friend gave me a gift card to Amway, making the system free for me.  </li>
            <li>For an old guy if you make your skin look this good I would recommend it.</li>
            <li>I need something with more moisturizing power as I do have very dry skin, but this would be wonderful for someone with normal skin.</li>
            <li>But still in the first week of use so hopefully this gets better.</li>
            <li>This refinishing cream by Artistry is worth the buy!</li>
            <li>and I love how smooth it feels going on my face as well as how soft my skin feels afterwards.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, it has evened out my skin tone and it has even cleared up my face.  </li>
            <li>Not a heavy moisturizer, very light.</li>
            <li>Just received the product yesterday and it actually arrived a lot sooner than the expected delivery date, which is AWESOME!!</li>
            <li>If there was one small critique, I wish it had just a bit more moisturizing power for when the winter is really rough on my skin, but for summer this is perfect.</li>
            <li>have reported the seller to the BBB, and plan to report Amazon if it does not step up and do the right thing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells nice, but no real benefits.&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used this brand</li>
            <li>it leaves your skin feeling so smooth and baby soft.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m going to see what the result is after 12 weeks (or more, since I&#x27;m only wearing it once a day).</li>
            <li>The lotion seems to provide protection between my new, fresh, exposed skin an the elements.  </li>
            <li>I use a little before I put my foundation on and it leaves my face nice and matte without any creases all day.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion its a little pricy but its worth every penny.</li>
            <li>it really dries my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Fast shipping on this order.</li>
            <li>It really does minimize pores, which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li>and after i wash my face and use this lotion my face is so soft!!!</li>
            <li>Ive used every product out there, and I was skeptical when I saw this was a pyramid scheme product, but it is actually the best quality of any moisturizer Ive used and I will buy over and over.</li>
            <li>so it is very rare for me to find products that are too dry for me.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended product.</li>
            <li>but it was highly rated on another site</li>
            <li>I used to buy pretty cheap face lotion from Walmart and none of those products ever dried my face out the way this one did.</li>
            <li>Leaves the skin soft like a baby&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>seller clearly made a Bait-n-Switch, then lied about it, and now refuses to provide a refund even with indisputable facts proving what I&#x27;ve stated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My husband is amazed at how soft my face feels.  </li>
            <li>have sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t do anything for</li>
            <li>I was surprised that this works as a lotion AND a primer.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this is calming and doesnt cause any irritation.</li>
            <li>Would recommend this for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Time Defiance skin refinisher is clearly marked as so on the bottle  as you can see in my photo...</li>
            <li>Applied the product this morning, it made my face so soft like baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>But so far, I like the way it made my face so soft and looks to me</li>
            <li>Though the names are similar, the products are very</li>
            <li>My skin (dry but very acne prone) feels like silk.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t matter how much of this product I put on my face, it was incredibly dry.</li>
            <li>As an adult, I still occasionally have breakouts</li>
            <li>the box has clear been opened and is not new.</li>
            <li>This is just the first day I&#x27;m wearing this product, it says to apply the product twice daily, but I will probably just use it once daily considering it is not cheap :</li>

            <li> When I applied this my skin felt so soft but after about 15 minutes my skin was all flaky and dry looking, I&#x27;ve started wearing face lotion with this to get rid of the flaky dry skin on my face.</li>
            <li> it makes other products you put on afterward soft too.</li>
            <li> This lotion definitely is the finishing touch after using with the microdermabrasion cream and cloth, as exfoliation can leave the skin a little sensitive.  </li>
            <li> The whole system is quite expensive and I only reordered this particular lotion because I have yet to run out of the cream</li>
            <li> I wish the bottle was bigger; it is way smaller than I expected.</li>

            <li> It does what it claims and completely disappears without a heavy feeling on the skin</li>
            <li> I was very surprised about how dry it was because I usually have somewhat oily skin.</li>
            <li> Helps minimize oily and dry spots on my combination skin.</li>
            <li> I could still see dry spots on my face.</li>
            <li> My skin is always dry</li>
            <li> Dry to the point that people could see how dry my face was from a few feet away.</li>
            <li> Just a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Time Defiance Skin Refinishing Lotion,&amp;#34; which is very, very different from &amp;#34;Artistry Skin Refinishing Lotion,&amp;#34; a less expensive, &amp;#34;lower&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> but it is the worst lotion I have ever put on my face.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this lotion.  I put it on before my moisturizer and it makes a world of difference.  My skin (dry but very acne prone) feels like silk.  My husband is amazed at how soft my face feels.  Just a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It is okay but I noticed that when applying the moisturizer it sometimes got clumpy. Never had that happen before.</li>
            <li> The most amazing lotion I have ever put on my face!</li>
            <li> Cream does a great job, but its a different version than what&#x27;s described, so I returned it.</li>
            <li> When I applied this my skin felt so soft but after about 15 minutes my skin was all flaky and dry looking, I&#x27;ve started wearing face lotion with this to get rid of the flaky dry skin on my face.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended product. Good seller.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s about it.  it really dries my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t do anything for it.&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice, but no real benefits.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money</li>
            <li> When I have it I use it twice a day.  It does what it claims and completely disappears without a heavy feeling on the skin</li>
            <li> Moisturizes well without a greasy feeling.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. Was worried about putting oil on my face because I am prone to breakouts, but my face has never looked clearer. Beautiful!</li>
            <li> I was surprised that this works as a lotion AND a primer. It absorbs almost instantly and doesnt leave that residue feeling. I dont need to pay for a primer now, and it keeps my eye-concealer from creasing and lasts all day under my powder. Helps minimize oily and dry spots on my combination skin. I have sensitive skin and this is calming and doesnt cause any irritation. If there was one small critique, I wish it had just a bit more moisturizing power for when the winter is really rough on my skin, but for summer this is perfect. Ive used every product out there, and I was skeptical when I saw this was a pyramid scheme product, but it is actually the best quality of any moisturizer Ive used and I will buy over and over.</li>
            <li> I could have given it 5 stars if my skin would have become perfect. But, still a lot of improvement in my skin after using it for now 2 months. People notice the difference on my face. Would recommend this for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight and smells wonderful. Doesnt leave your face oily at all. I do wish it were a bit more hydrating - within minutes of putting it on I could still see dry spots on my face. But still in the first week of use so hopefully this gets better.</li>
            <li> Mistake or Fraud.... Not sure. All I know is that I ordered TIME DEFIANCE Skin Refinishing Lotion and received a different Skin Refinishing Lotion. the box has clear been opened and is not new. There is a sticker/barcode on the box that says Artistry Time Defiance, but it is an obvious transplant to this box... Time Defiance skin refinisher is clearly marked as so on the bottle  as you can see in my photo... This one is something else.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping on this order. I haven&#x27;t used this particular order, but I have used it in the past. It really does minimize pores, which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used this brand but it was highly rated on another site so I thought I would try it out.  I can honestly say this is one of the best, if not the best, moisturizer I have ever used.  I love the way it smells and I love how smooth it feels going on my face as well as how soft my skin feels afterwards.  It absorbs quickly, it has evened out my skin tone and it has even cleared up my face.  I will definitely be purchasing it again!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t matter how much of this product I put on my face, it was incredibly dry. Dry to the point that people could see how dry my face was from a few feet away. It made my skin flake off. I was very surprised about how dry it was because I usually have somewhat oily skin. As an adult, I still occasionally have breakouts so it is very rare for me to find products that are too dry for me. This product had great reviews so I thought it would be amazing but it is the worst lotion I have ever put on my face. I used to buy pretty cheap face lotion from Walmart and none of those products ever dried my face out the way this one did.</li>
            <li> Pricy but it work&#x27;s well</li>
            <li> Great product my skin feels so soft and smooth</li>
            <li> Excellent product but a bit pricey for 1 oz.  I will still be buying it because i have no choice.</li>
            <li> I began using this microdermabrasion system after a friend gave me a gift card to Amway, making the system free for me.  It is an effective system.  This lotion definitely is the finishing touch after using with the microdermabrasion cream and cloth, as exfoliation can leave the skin a little sensitive.  The lotion seems to provide protection between my new, fresh, exposed skin an the elements.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was the price.  The whole system is quite expensive and I only reordered this particular lotion because I have yet to run out of the cream and I did not wish to use the cream without the lotion.  However, once I run out the cream, I will probably look for a more cost-effective system that works well.</li>
            <li> Lotion goes on like silk. Not a heavy moisturizer, very light. I wish the bottle was bigger; it is way smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> This refinishing cream by Artistry is worth the buy! it leaves your skin feeling so smooth and baby soft. Even when I don&#x27;t use it in combination with the Microdermabration gel, it still works great! I use a little before I put my foundation on and it leaves my face nice and matte without any creases all day. Certainly a top of the line product!</li>
            <li> Leaves the skin soft like a baby&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> made my skin fresh&lt;br /&gt;I had a lot of whiteheads on my face&lt;br /&gt;It made my skin exfoliated and made it better&lt;br /&gt;thank you!</li>
            <li> Blends perfectly to my skin !</li>
            <li> I have used this before.  I like the way it makes my skin.  For an old guy if you make your skin look this good I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Just received the product yesterday and it actually arrived a lot sooner than the expected delivery date, which is AWESOME!! Applied the product this morning, it made my face so soft like baby&#x27;s bottom. I put on an SPF moisturizer on top of it and realized the product made the SPF moisturizer worked better on my face as well. This is just the first day I&#x27;m wearing this product, it says to apply the product twice daily, but I will probably just use it once daily considering it is not cheap :(.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait for the progress since it says it will improve your skin by 52% after 12 weeks of applications. So, I&#x27;m going to see what the result is after 12 weeks (or more, since I&#x27;m only wearing it once a day). But so far, I like the way it made my face so soft and looks to me it makes other products you put on afterward soft too. Oh and it also smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin so smooth, feels great.  I need something with more moisturizing power as I do have very dry skin, but this would be wonderful for someone with normal skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!.....i have bought and used and thrown away soooo many things!....I love this lotion it makes my skin feel like velvet and smells wonderful....i brought it to work and let co-workers put a dab on their hand and they too are going to order it.....just stop looking cause this is the best ive ever tried!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t write a review of this product since the seller sent a different product and refuses to provide a refund. I ordered &amp;#34;Artistry Time Defiance Skin Refinishing Lotion,&amp;#34; which is very, very different from &amp;#34;Artistry Skin Refinishing Lotion,&amp;#34; a less expensive, &amp;#34;lower&amp;#34; product. Though the names are similar, the products are very different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller then lied and wrote &amp;#34;... Artistry is no longer making Time Defiance so they have removed the &amp;#34;Time Defiance&amp;#34; logo from it. However, the product is the same.&amp;#34; This is untrue. Amway is the maker, Artistry is the Line of skin products. &amp;#34;Time Defiance&amp;#34; is made by Amway, who is still producing it. I sent pictures of both products to the seller (had to purchase &amp;#34;Time Defiance&amp;#34; elsewhere): a side-by-side comparison of both the front and side (ingredients, stick numbers) of the Time Defiance and what the seller sent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller clearly made a Bait-n-Switch, then lied about it, and now refuses to provide a refund even with indisputable facts proving what I&#x27;ve stated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have reported the seller to the BBB, and plan to report Amazon if it does not step up and do the right thing.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion its a little pricy but its worth every penny. My skin is always dry and after i wash my face and use this lotion my face is so soft!!!</li>
