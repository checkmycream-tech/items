            <li>This works great, no problems with it at all.</li>
            <li>Very enjoyable to wear.</li>
            <li>In addition, you will feel more attractive in wearing a silk one.</li>
            <li>Nice but the side of my mask was ripped when it arrived.</li>
            <li>I received this product in exchange for my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li>The satin feels nice against my face.</li>
            <li>The sleep mask is made of a very nice material and feels cool to the skin.</li>
            <li>strap keeps it very securely in place and still comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I am no longer having issues with the allergic reaction to the fabric.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>gave it 2 stars because the price was ok</li>
            <li>Slips a bit, but works pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I have a feeling that over time the strap might stretch (so far it&#x27;s great).</li>
            <li>Easy to fall asleep with it on.  </li>
            <li>Satiny smooth, light weight, easy to wear and keep on throughout the night.</li>
            <li>Not adjustable, and light leaks though.</li>
            <li>Totally comfortable in every way.  </li>
            <li>cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight but keeps the light out.</li>
            <li>satin mask, satin band, and beautiful pink color.</li>
            <li>Best eye mask ever, soft,pleasant to the face, head band is soft and loose too.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t block light as much as I would like it to.</li>
            <li>It is the same on both top and bottom.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>However, I like this product so much that I&#x27;m totally willing to buy another</li>
            <li>mask is very pretty with so soft cushions for my eyes.  </li>
            <li>would recommend this to anyone who wants a mask for sleeping.  </li>
            <li>I really like how this mask feels on.</li>
            <li>I do think next time I will buy black to block more light, but serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li>It is not too tight, but will keep the light out.</li>
            <li>This mask is extremely soft and fits well.</li>
            <li>Soft and silky fabric.</li>
            <li>The lights from outside my bedroom in addition to the early sunrise were affecting my sleep.  </li>
            <li>It also keeps the light out well, even with the pale pink color I selected!</li>
            <li>I purchased to help keep fuzz and blanket fibers from getting into my dry, sensitive eyes after cataract surgery.</li>
            <li>The mask itself is a little large, but that just means it covers my eye area</li>
            <li>My only issue is that it is a little large for my head and the fabric is slippery so during the night it will shift off my eyes.</li>

            <li> Slips a bit, but works pretty good.  I do think next time I will buy black to block more light, but serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> Not adjustable, and light leaks though.</li>
            <li> Nice but the side of my mask was ripped when it arrived.</li>
            <li> Totally comfortable in every way.  Easy to fall asleep with it on.  Could not be happier.  A+  I bought the champagne version too.</li>
            <li> I received this product in exchange for my honest opinion.  The sleep mask is made of a very nice material and feels cool to the skin. The mask completely covers my eyes so that I have no light coming in the sides. Very enjoyable to wear.</li>
            <li> The strap is in center so it pulls right across your eyes, very badly designed. It cannot be adjusted. No structure at all so it touches your eyes. Disappointing!</li>
            <li> This mask is extremely soft and fits well. The entire strap is covered in silk and it does not snag my hair or leave a kink like my last mask. It also keeps the light out well, even with the pale pink color I selected!</li>
            <li> Soft and silky fabric. It is not too tight, but will keep the light out.</li>
            <li> Best eye mask ever, soft,pleasant to the face, head band is soft and loose too. Very happy.</li>
            <li> This sleep mask has everything I was looking for-- satin mask, satin band, and beautiful pink color. The mask itself is a little large, but that just means it covers my eye area well. I have a feeling that over time the strap might stretch (so far it&#x27;s great). However, I like this product so much that I&#x27;m totally willing to buy another if/when that time comes. The satin feels nice against my face. I prefer the satin strap because the Velcro ones get caught in my hair. Definitely 5 stars.</li>
            <li> cheap and flimsy. not filled enough and wears out in less than a month. doesn&#x27;t last long at all. the elastic stretches out so it becomes too big after a while and it moves around while you sleep. gave it 2 stars because the price was ok</li>
            <li> Satiny smooth, light weight, easy to wear and keep on throughout the night. I purchased to help keep fuzz and blanket fibers from getting into my dry, sensitive eyes after cataract surgery.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed. The picture made it look like there were no seams to make wrinkles on your face but there are and they do! :(</li>
            <li> This works great, no problems with it at all.</li>
            <li> This is the third sleep mask that I have tried.  The lights from outside my bedroom in addition to the early sunrise were affecting my sleep.  I, also, have problems with allergies which affect my eyes (swelling).&lt;br /&gt;This mask is very pretty with so soft cushions for my eyes.  I do like that the mask does not have a specific way to wear it.  There is no &amp;#34;top/bottom&amp;#34;.  It is the same on both top and bottom.&lt;br /&gt;The strap keeps it very securely in place and still comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I am no longer having issues with the allergic reaction to the fabric.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who wants a mask for sleeping.  In addition, you will feel more attractive in wearing a silk one.</li>
            <li> I really like how this mask feels on. It&#x27;s lightweight but keeps the light out. My only issue is that it is a little large for my head and the fabric is slippery so during the night it will shift off my eyes.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t block light as much as I would like it to.</li>
