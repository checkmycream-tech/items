    <ol>
            <li>THIS IS THE BEST COMB EVER MADE!!!  </li>
            <li>Very happy with this comb.  </li>
            <li>very good to get tangles out.</li>
            <li>This is just as good as my OG one from 1987</li>
            <li>Good price and quality.</li>
            <li>I put them in the dishwasher to clean them and it keeps them in good shape.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to use after shampooing, for tangles, and for just rising - something to quickly get combed.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>What more is there to say?</li>
            <li>4 more words required.</li>
            <li>love these combs after all these years.</li>
            <li>Cheap.</li>
            <li>Cheap.</li>
            <li>Cheap.  </li>
            <li>This comb has smooth teeth</li>
            <li>The weight and size of the comb feels good and natural in your hands.  </li>
            <li>This one is great -- good handle and nice thick, but not too wide teeth.</li>
            <li>Got this for my husband to comb his hair in the shower and get the conditioner/shampoo into his super think hair (its shoulder length too)</li>
            <li>Perfect for wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it very long but seems to be effective.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well for this purpose, doesn&#x27;t work well on tangles though.</li>
            <li>At this time, I have a rather large beard, and this comb goes right through the morning tangles with ease.</li>
            <li>but he doesn&#x27;t think its fine enough for that.</li>
            <li>Gentle on the scalp.</li>
            <li>Did I say cheap enough times?  </li>
            <li>Was a good quality comb but was larger than I expected.  </li>
            <li>One can comb, detangle, and style his or her hair whether it is wet or dry; coarse or straight; and is great to massage your scalp with.  </li>
            <li>Although I was surprised at the size of this comb when I got it, it works very well for what I use it.</li>
            <li>He says its fen just to use as a normal comb.</li>
            <li>I lost a beloved comb in a similar design and was forced to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>I love these combs, they are sturdy and wide enough to not snag hair.</li>
            <li>Big enough to basically straighten hair quickly in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I have really long thick straight hair and like to use it in the shower to get it nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I also use it after I dry to keep it straight.</li>
            <li>Combs my hair like no other.</li>
            <li>Back in the day, there was no such thing as an ACE comb for men -- this was simply the one and only ACE Shampoo comb, then some moron came up with the more cheaply made (and offensively named) women&#x27;s comb which is smaller and made of some sort of cheap rubber composite.  </li>
            <li>I would have given this review five stars, but this version of the comb is not made of the hard rubber like the original, and seems to be made of that crappy rubbery material that Ray-Ban makes it Wayfairers from now.</li>

            <li> It is 8\\&quot; long, whereas my Goody combs purchased years ago are only about 5\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would use it if you have naturally tangly hair.</li>
            <li> I use it to comb out long hair when its wet.  </li>
            <li> There is very little resistance!</li>

            <li> i used it all the time</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband to comb his hair in the shower and get the conditioner/shampoo into his super think hair (its shoulder length too) but he doesn&#x27;t think its fine enough for that. He says its fen just to use as a normal comb.</li>
            <li> Product as advertised, delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it very long but seems to be effective. I have really long thick straight hair and like to use it in the shower to get it nice and soft. I also use it after I dry to keep it straight. Works pretty well for this purpose, doesn&#x27;t work well on tangles though. Not sure if I would use it if you have naturally tangly hair.</li>
            <li> The comb is what you expect when you buy an Ace product. Gentle on the scalp.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Had one for years that I lost. This is just as good as my OG one from 1987</li>
            <li> Not the same quality as they used to be, but then again, neither is my hair.</li>
            <li> Combs my hair like no other.</li>
            <li> Back in the day, there was no such thing as an ACE comb for men -- this was simply the one and only ACE Shampoo comb, then some moron came up with the more cheaply made (and offensively named) women&#x27;s comb which is smaller and made of some sort of cheap rubber composite.  Did I say cheap enough times?  Cheap. Cheap. Cheap.  THIS IS THE BEST COMB EVER MADE!!!  The weight and size of the comb feels good and natural in your hands.  One can comb, detangle, and style his or her hair whether it is wet or dry; coarse or straight; and is great to massage your scalp with.  I would have given this review five stars, but this version of the comb is not made of the hard rubber like the original, and seems to be made of that crappy rubbery material that Ray-Ban makes it Wayfairers from now.</li>
            <li> Although I was surprised at the size of this comb when I got it, it works very well for what I use it. At this time, I have a rather large beard, and this comb goes right through the morning tangles with ease. There is very little resistance! It is 8\\&quot; long, whereas my Goody combs purchased years ago are only about 5\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Comes just as described. I lost a beloved comb in a similar design and was forced to buy a new one. This one is great -- good handle and nice thick, but not too wide teeth. Perfect for wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I like a comb like this in the bathroom. Even though my hair is thinning it still tangles and this takes care of it without pulling anymore hair out.</li>
            <li> Was a good quality comb but was larger than I expected.  Too big for my back pocket so I returned it. Size should be included in description.</li>
            <li> Bigger than what the dimensions state.</li>
            <li> I love these combs, they are sturdy and wide enough to not snag hair. they dont have catchy areas either. I put them in the dishwasher to clean them and it keeps them in good shape. they last for years. I use it to comb out long hair when its wet.  very good to get tangles out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a comb and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to. What more is there to say? 4 more words required.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this comb.  Big enough to basically straighten hair quickly in the morning.  Couldn&#x27;t find this at the discount mart I go to - had looked for it several times at both stores and they didn&#x27;t have it.  It&#x27;s good to use after shampooing, for tangles, and for just rising - something to quickly get combed.  Later finishing touches can be done but sometimes you just need the big basics.</li>
            <li> This comb has smooth teeth so it does not scratch my head like cheaper combs. Good price and quality.</li>
            <li> love these combs after all these years.</li>
