            <li>Smells really good.  </li>
            <li>Works fairly well -</li>
            <li>It seems like it would be a good detangler if for nothing else.</li>
            <li>But this gives it beautiful shape while being able to run my fingers through it.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and my hair has great volume and the curls/waves tighten up nicely with no crunchy feeling. :)</li>

            <li>Camille rose)</li>
            <li>This is totally awesome, and it sounds great, definitely get it....</li>
            <li>One of the best products for soft curls!!!</li>
            <li>All in all, this is the best product that I&#x27;ve ever used and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty curly but the way this defines adds softness and shine and bounce is incredible.</li>
            <li>Very strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for my naturally curly hair!</li>
            <li>After using a curling iron and damaging my hair, I&#x27;ve been working towards getting the top starts to curl more rather than wave and this stuff helps a lot!</li>
            <li>Pillow Soft Curls is the best styling product I&#x27;ve ever used on my curls, and gives me the very best 2nd day hair I&#x27;ve ever had (usually, my first day is the best).</li>
            <li>My hair is shinny supersoft, defined curls AND holds the light clean smell ALL day!!!</li>
            <li>Curls is by far the best.....</li>
            <li>great for curly hair with a fun smell</li>
            <li>Both my husband and son have naturally curly hair and this product works great to make their hair tamed!</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and curly, works great!</li>
            <li>The product has a nice creamy texture and I love the smell</li>
            <li>The smell is strong - fortunately, it smells great.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li>The smell is so strong!  </li>
            <li>I like the smell, but it is very strong (smells like fabric softener, as many say).</li>
            <li>Love Love Love Love!</li>
            <li>Plus the smell is amazing and clean!</li>
            <li>This lotion is great for me because my hair isn&#x27;t exactly curly, but it still needs hold</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine, curly in some places and more crimped-looking in others.  </li>
            <li>Kinda beachy and super easy!!</li>
            <li>The product I love, have been using it for 2 years and still like the way it works in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products including all the name brands.</li>
            <li>Some work better than others but Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow&lt;br /&gt;Soft</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite product to encourage my hair to curl without being frizzy.</li>
            <li>And it smells like a spa :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still not quite sure how I feel about this.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>It smells like fabric softener (I love the smell btw) because it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;fabric</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>She guaranteed that I would love this product</li>
            <li>etc free so it will not hurt!</li>
            <li>I still add a bit of Oribe&#x27;s gel serum for a better definition and that creates the most defined and tamed look.</li>
            <li>and i love smelling my hair all afternoon.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful and gives just enough definition.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m that over the top about or whether I just don&#x27;t want to take the time to do it.</li>
            <li>This worked ok, still had spots of frizz and the smell of this is for sure overpowering.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I got a sample from BirchBox to try and I fell in love with this curl creme.</li>
            <li>Mostly because I&#x27;ve never found that</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products including Ms. Jessie&#x27;s Curl Meringue, Curly pudding, and Butter Creme.</li>
            <li>I love how this works for my curls -</li>
            <li>love this hair lotion.</li>
            <li>I love the scent</li>
            <li>I was hoping i&#x27;d be able to just throw this product in and it would make my hair wavier</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I have medium length wavy hair that is frizz prone and inconsistent, but this product seems to have tamed it (most of the time).&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>Absolutely love my curls when I use this product.</li>
            <li>Curls, curls and more curls.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that there is a product out there that will &amp;#34;encourage&amp;#34; my curls without making my wallet sob.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe it will work better for those with a bit finer texture?</li>
            <li>I seriously love this product.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite curly hair product I&#x27;ve used in years</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I used to really love how miss jessie would leave my curls.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  feels nice &amp; light.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to get more.</li>
            <li>I love Miss Jessie&#x27;s products, but this one did not suit my hair.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I like the product, but do not see a noticable hold or impact whether i use or not, i will probably use more as a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>i love that my hair doesnt feel tangly...</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>While it didn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy like most curl creams do, it doesn&#x27;t make it &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>My hair curled better without the product in.</li>
            <li>Love that I no longer have crunchy hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This better not get discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I looooooove this and reccomend this product to everyone :-)</li>
            <li>I also love the smell.</li>
            <li>Spray some water on my strands then coat it with this stuff, and the slip and texture of my hair is astonishing.</li>
            <li>That being said, I love how my hair feels.  </li>
            <li>MY FAVORITE PRODUCT FOR MY DAUGHTER&#x27;S CURLY HAIR.....</li>
            <li>but I spend more on all the products I used to buy and get s***ty results.</li>
            <li>looks so cute</li>
            <li>This totally fit the bill!</li>
            <li>This product is fabulous!</li>
            <li>The scent of the cream is lovely.</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels and smells.  </li>
            <li>I sent away for it and am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>Better off using eco styler gel.</li>
            <li>so I have to use more than what they recommend but it works better than frizzease.</li>
            <li>Its not horrible, but it is overpowering and probably would not complement most perfumes or lotions.  </li>
            <li>This is possibly the best hair product I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>The top layers are the hardest to curl and</li>
            <li>This product is just OK.  </li>
            <li>- sure it&#x27;s like fabric softener</li>
            <li>Diffuse is okay</li>
            <li>I really really love this product.  </li>
            <li>Miss Jessie, consider a better fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I really love this product and encourage ANY person with curly hair to try it.</li>
            <li>This one I love</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I sampled this product &amp; fell in love.</li>
            <li>I used to do wash and go&#x27;s for the most part but the detangling was a production on wash days</li>
            <li>I love the scent.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Love love LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m totally happy, and my cabinet thanks me.  </li>
            <li>My hair has just the right amount of volume and it&#x27;s been day 2 and my hair is still looking good.</li>
            <li>said, I found the smell to be clean and nice.</li>
            <li>I got this specifically because people were complaining of the strong, fabric softener scent since I happen to love that smell, and wanted a product to get a bit more wear out of my unwashed hair.</li>
            <li>Great change form my normal routine</li>
            <li>Awesome for long curly hair.  </li>
            <li>It smells pretty good, almost like Downy or laundry detergent.</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad at all, in fact it is quite nice.  </li>
            <li>I liked this product, it smells good, it makes my hair really soft and curly!</li>
            <li>This works perfectly: I put a small-ish dollop through and just scrunched a lot and let it air dry.</li>
            <li>I could use more, but the smell is quite strong.</li>
            <li>however this products makes my hair very soft and it smells so great.</li>
            <li>the best part is I just spray my hair with a little water the next day, add a smig more product (about 1/2 a tablespoon) and the results are JUST as good!!!</li>
            <li>I was happy with the way my hair looked the day I used this product, but the scent of it was just too much - there was a very strong chemical smell right from the start.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing, and worth the price!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use about a quarter size on wet hair and then diffuse for best results.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for anyone with natural wave or curl in their hair.  </li>
            <li>It not only keeps my waves looking shiny and in tact, but it smells incredible.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still experimenting with it - with slightly better results when I mix it with some cheap</li>
            <li>The curls were soft and looked great.  </li>
            <li>This product  leave my hair so soft, and it smells great- like baby powder.</li>
            <li>So far has worked great in my hair</li>
            <li>I did notice a bit more shrinkage with using this product, probably because it is so light.  </li>
            <li>SO I TOOK CHANCE AND TRIED IT  SO FAR HAPPY WITH IT</li>
            <li>If you can deal with your hair kind of, sort of smelling like a dryer sheet, it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s kind of pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>Specially hair stuff!  </li>
            <li>My hair is very fine (but full) and wavy.</li>
            <li>Also, the scent is very sweet and strong.</li>
            <li>I thought the price was a little high for a prodcut I never heard of, but it was the best chance i took on a great result.  </li>
            <li>I purchased a sample 1oz packet before shelling out $25 for a full sized tube, and even that was $7!</li>
            <li>It leaves curls bouncy and full and waves luscious!</li>
            <li>I also have the best second-day hair I&#x27;ve had with any other product.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I rarely give 5 stars to anything!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t think of enough words to describe how good this product is!</li>
            <li>At best is might have reduced the frizz in my hair but other than</li>
            <li>Knits fell out so easily and actually loved the fabric softener scent of this particular one</li>
            <li>so I ordered from Amazon and the product was delivered very quickly....</li>
            <li>The smell is ok, it smells like clean laundry (maybe even febreze).</li>
            <li>I did not find it overwhelming at all, and just smells clean to me.  </li>
            <li>but I love the smell of clean laundry</li>
            <li>it smells like fabric softener, but the smell disappears very quickly.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it is too strong</li>
            <li>it actually is so strong i have gotten a headache or two.</li>
            <li>This product really promotes lovely curls on the longer part and adds some nice texture to the rest.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind the scent, but it IS strong and DOES smell like fabric softener.</li>
            <li>I had read that the smell was strong, but thought I would try it anyway.  </li>
            <li>It smells like fabric softener and its so strong</li>
            <li>smell was strong and could not use this</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel the smell was too strong</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a hair product smell so strongly of perfume.</li>
            <li>Its just not as strong as I was led to believe.  </li>
            <li>The result is beautifully shaped, soft, full, NON-frizzy and NON-crunchy curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So if you can&#x27;t handle strong fragrance, this probably isn&#x27;t the product for you.</li>
            <li>It DOES smell like fabric softener, but I did not find it to be too offensive or strong, and it has dissipated a lot since drying.</li>
            <li>Strong fabric softener is not something I want my hair to smell like.  </li>
            <li>The scent is fairly strong, and that is probably a turn off for a lot of people.  </li>
            <li>I have read a lot of reviews where it&#x27;s just too strong for some people</li>
            <li>Yes, it has a strong perfume scent -</li>
            <li>Although the smell is strong-</li>
            <li>but the scent is EXTREMELY STRONG</li>
            <li>but I thought it was too strong.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not that strong anymore....</li>
            <li>The smell is really strong.</li>
            <li>, it isn&#x27;t strong and doesn&#x27;t seem to clash with perfume.</li>
            <li>every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got a fairly strong scent, but I like it.</li>
            <li>It does NOT have a strong smell like some of the reviews</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame, too, because I know my hair could be beautiful if it the curls were defined properly.  </li>
            <li>The best part is it&#x27;s cruelty free, so it&#x27;s a product I feel good about putting my hard-earned dollars behind.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best.</li>
            <li>but I love sweet scents so it worked out fine for me.  </li>
            <li>This is the best, hands down.</li>
            <li>The AG Recoil gives just enough hold, the Pillow Soft gives great soft-curl definition and smells very nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Caucasian with fine wavy/curly hair.</li>
            <li>But if you use a drop about the size of a dime or less, it will be perfect.</li>
            <li>I have fine, medium curly hair.</li>
            <li>curly bob, with fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li>Because my hair is so fine, I let it air-dry</li>
            <li>Possibly better for leople with super curly hair as I just have wavy.</li>
            <li>I save so much time in the morning not having to straighten my hair, and my hair is now in much better condition and is growing faster, now that I&#x27;m not frying it every day!</li>
            <li>This does a great job of defining the curls without a lot of frizz while still being super soft-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m falling in love with my hair for the first time ever!</li>
            <li>It Takes The Frizz Out Of My Daughters Kinky Curls and makes her curls into these perfect little spirals.</li>
            <li>Probably one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used, as far as leaving me with soft, defrizzed curls.  </li>
            <li>A few months ago Redbook Magazine ran an article on the Best Beauty Buys available in 2013.</li>
            <li>and when i don&#x27;t...soft hair that feels and smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>It is a light hold and does not leave my hair looking greasy</li>
            <li>(your curls come out smooth, shiny &amp; well defined)</li>
            <li>One day, I stumbled upon a review for this product on Makeup Alley (my go-to place for honest reviews besides Amazon) and everyone was absolutely RAVING about this product, even the wild-maned girls.</li>
            <li>I do enjoy the fabric softener smell however.</li>
            <li>those days I really need to look amazing.</li>
            <li>But I love that I can go 2 days without washing my hair because it is not greasy or gummy and the smell is still fresh.</li>
            <li>The consistency of the cream is light in weight and density, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about the cream creating an oily/greasy appearance on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good for soft hair.</li>
            <li>I wish the product provided a tad more volume for my thinning hair, but overall it does a good job.</li>
            <li>I gave 3 stars cuz It does smell good like fabric softener and it makes your hair soft.</li>
            <li>If you buy this product, I would strongly suggest applying sparingly the first time and working your way up to using more, until you find an amount that works for you.  </li>
            <li>but I had to give this product 4 stars because the smell is so sweet and strong</li>
            <li>but omg it is a very powerful laundry smell.</li>
            <li>I do admit that the smell is very powerful out of the tube.  </li>
            <li>Miss Jessie&#x27;s Super Soft Pillow Soft Curls was named The Best Curl Definer for Thick/Coarse Hair.</li>
            <li>For moisture, I find that the very reasonably priced StaSofFro works MUCH better (without a residue).</li>
            <li>I am so glad I came across this product, I tried it out and my curls are soft and for the most part frizz free.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>I had read all the rave reviews and was so excited to use it.</li>
            <li>It smells like fresh linens!</li>
            <li>It does smell wonderful, like Downy, but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>in all I say it&#x27;s totally worth the money!  </li>
            <li>Original bought it for my styles but didn&#x27;t like how it felt on my hair.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>So worth the money!..</li>
            <li>I have a mixture of 4a &amp; 4c hair type,  I usually have to twist or flattwist my hair with product to get define curls, the Miss Jessie&#x27;s Curling Pudding worked best for me.</li>
            <li>I had to clean everything off before I could read the book or use the product.  </li>
            <li>It smells so clean.</li>
            <li>Yes it has a clean, fabric softener smell.  </li>
            <li>It smells clean</li>
            <li>But it a clean smell</li>
            <li>While an OK product, it doesn&#x27;t really lengthen or smooth curls.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, am soooo thrilled that I finally found something that works!</li>
            <li>I just smell really clean all the time I guess.</li>
            <li>I read about this product in Allure Magazine and even though I tend to be frugal, I sprung for the elevated pricetag to try Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls, and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>and she was right!</li>
            <li>: I found the right combo!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s exactly right!  </li>
            <li>When it dries, it has a nice beachy wave look to it, and it&#x27;s soft (not crunchy) and clean feeling to the touch.</li>
            <li>but some how makes hair dry quickly which is great for wash and go.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful natural not stiff curls is what you have wearing this product</li>
            <li>My naturally curly hair looks and feels amazing with this product.  </li>
            <li>It makes it feel so soft and defines my twist out amazingly.</li>
            <li>I finished my usual curl product that I was supremely happy with and should have ordered more...</li>
            <li>Lately I have been on a mission to find the best products for my type 3a curly hair and decided to try this product after having read the reviews.  </li>
            <li>I got a deluxe sample size of this pillow soft curl cream from my  monthly Birchbox subscription.</li>
            <li>I apply the product about a dime size at a time and make sure not to touch it/style it too much</li>
            <li>To fe fair, I am a big fan of unscented beauty products.</li>
            <li>This leaves my curly hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Loving Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls.</li>
            <li>I think this is probably because it&#x27;s made with avocado, coconut, sweet almond, and olive</li>
            <li>Waiting for my full size to arrive.</li>
            <li>The scent is quite strong - it smells exactly like liquid fabric softener.  </li>
            <li>I have no problem with the smell, at first it was strong</li>
            <li>Other days I put it in after a shower and run out of the house and it still dries and looks great without the use of bed heads product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m pretty sure I have 3a/3b naturally brown curls but with some heat damage on the top strands.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length fine hair and my curls were noticably crisp</li>
            <li>It smells like clean clothes, fresh out of the dryer, and it does fade over the course of the day.</li>
            <li>But who doesn&#x27;t like the smell of fresh clean laundry??</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have super curly hair, just wavy to medium curls.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I have super powers.</li>
            <li>I would most definitely buy this product once more.</li>
            <li>I use this along with the Miss Jessie&#x27;s Super Slip Sudsy Shampoo and the DevaCare One Condition, No-Fade Ultra Creamy Conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t super curly</li>
            <li>a quick wash n go cuz it does serve as a curl activator</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>For my first attempt, I decided I would use it on its own because I think a product that costs $22 should be able to work a little magic by itself.</li>
            <li>but wow!I have always had the crunchy, noodle curl and this left my fine curly hair defined, soft, and smelling great.</li>
            <li>This is my very first review of any product on Amazon; I have been a prime member for two years.</li>
            <li>First of all, it smells fantastic, like a Downy dryer sheet.</li>
            <li>A small peach pit size amount seems to be my ideal amount to define curl, and keep the grease to a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The reason I gave it only 4 stars is because the fragrance is very overwhelming, but I still use the heck out of the product anyway.</li>
            <li>Live and learn :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried using less, but I don&#x27;t get great results and still have the residual greasiness from it.</li>
            <li>I first tried this product by itself, about a quarter sized amount, it did not provide enough hold to give good definition.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I have actually heard about this a long time ago through my best friend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy and controls frizz pretty well along with adding a nice shine.  </li>
            <li>and I find that a small amount, maybe 1 tbsp, enhances my curls and leaves them nice, soft, and smelling great.  </li>
            <li>My hair is untammable and its pretty well tamed!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I received this as a full size for free because if I actually paid money for this I would be livid.  </li>
            <li>I have wavy unruly hair and this is the only product to date in my 51 years that has tamed my hair and made me love having wavy hair!  </li>
            <li>Love it and leaves your hair super soft.</li>
            <li>Fine, straight-wavy, and much shorter.</li>
            <li>I have fine, medium thick curly/wavy hair and this product works great.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t return it, I&#x27;ve used up 90% of the bottle and have had great results, although because of the cost, I don&#x27;t use it everyday, I use a leave in conditioner or refresher products along with my oils (almond, coconut, evoo and glycerin mix).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really does a fantastic job controlling the lioness mane.</li>
            <li>Always looking for something to define the curls and calm the friz, this doesn&#x27;t do either.</li>
            <li>and this really does leave my hair nice and soft and</li>
            <li>well worth it.</li>
            <li>Paying the price is totally worth it</li>
            <li>I am going natural and I love this product.  </li>
            <li>My curls end up feeling soft, and it controls most of the frizz.</li>
            <li>Smells almost like fresh linen or laundry detergent</li>
            <li>Like many reviewers here have said, it does smell a bit like fabric softener, so if you&#x27;re sensitive to that, don&#x27;t get it.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten a lot of compliments on the fresh smell of my hair.</li>
            <li>and this is by far the top of all products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>if i wanna look like i did any kind of styling to it, i twist a section of it and clip it back .</li>
            <li>even the next day my hair has a nice fresh smell to it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the fabric softener smell, either.</li>
            <li>I am not crazy about the smell, however.  </li>
            <li>She says it makes her curls soft and not crunchy like most curly hair products.</li>
            <li>I do this 2 times a week (on rare occasions</li>
            <li>Plus I found Airwick Snuggle Fresh Linen wax melts for my scentsy warmers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to wear my hear naturally curly because it would be too frizzy, and not defined.</li>
            <li>, I have a long hair and my curls looked so natural and beautiful ..</li>
            <li>My curls are huge and soft so freaking bouncy !!!</li>
            <li>a great product for my hair...does not leave it stiff..</li>
            <li>This product smells nice and went on easy, but weighed down my curls</li>
            <li>I also have the Quick Curl Cream and this does bigger, rounder curls where as the Quick Curl Cream makes tighter, more spiral type curls</li>
            <li>I use about two squirts and my hair is pretty much covered and my curls really haven&#x27;t even looked better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a million hair products trying to get the right curl from my hair.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll just need to find the right combo.  </li>
            <li>right here will get me to mid-back length and achieve the softness I desire.</li>
            <li>It would probably work better on fine dry hair.</li>
            <li>It say&#x27;s on the label that your curls will be soft and full, and not look like Ramen noodles, and that it feels really light on the hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had long gorgeous hair my whole life.</li>
            <li>My new husband thinks it smells good - and could only smell it if he put his face in my hair.</li>
            <li>Helped to make my hair less &#x27;fro&#x27; and more FABULOUS!</li>
            <li>Great product for my usual frizzy curls.</li>
            <li>Yes it smells good, a little too good, but other than that</li>
            <li>I typically can get a good amount of curl with a lot of product</li>
            <li>I STAND behins this product from a person who struggles with not having time to blow out my hair everyday and wants to know my curls will look great anytime I use</li>
            <li>This product should not be called &amp;#34;Pillow Soft Curls.&amp;#34; I must admit that I love the smell of this product, it really smells like liquid fabric softener.  </li>
            <li>Smells great, not enough hold, and leaves my hair a big frizzy POOF.</li>
            <li>This product is more of a liquid than I expected but it works better that way because it looks natural!!</li>
            <li>The smell can be a bit overwhelming at first though, so if you&#x27;re sensitive to scents I would just suggest not using too much of the product in one sitting.</li>
            <li>I have smooth, soft curls with definition!</li>
            <li>Nice loose definition with no crunch.</li>
            <li>I have natural fine 3a/4a hair</li>
            <li>I have fine wavy hair and have been looking for something that makes my hair soft while brining out my curls in frizzy miami.  </li>
            <li>So if you have fine, naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>Fresh scent (may be strong for some), light weight, and minimal build up.  </li>
            <li>I was pretty surprised to learn that it wasn&#x27;t intended for my hair type in the first place, because it really gives me a better texture than anything else I have tried in my last 13 years of trying to fix curly hair &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>makes your hair super super soft and relaxed curls.  </li>
            <li>I like Miss Jessie&#x27;s Transitioner&#x27;s Magic a little bit better just because i have straight parts in my hair.  </li>
            <li>It is not unpleasant, and definitely not that strong.  </li>
            <li>Ths is a little too light for my very fine curly wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I do wish is wasn&#x27;t so expensive, but it is a great product!</li>
            <li>Really enjoy Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it really keeps my curls under control!</li>
            <li>Soft, smooth, waves...</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li>I have never worn my hair curly because I could never find a product that would keep my curls soft and not crunchy, as well as frizz free.  </li>
            <li>I have 3c curls up top and 4a corkscrew curls in the back.  </li>
            <li>Husband wants me to buy it by the case!</li>
            <li>On my next attempt I used more product, ~half-dollar amount, which I scrunched in, then towel-scrunched to absorb excess, then diffused.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got WAY too much fragrance in it!</li>
            <li>The funny thing is, the results get better after the second day - when you re-scrunch the hair with dampened fingertips.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a Caucasian female who&#x27;s battled frizzy, unmanageable hair for most of my life.</li>
            <li>even after being outside most of the day.</li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I wanted and was the size that was advertised.</li>
            <li>but my hair no longer smells like Downy ;)</li>
            <li>I have super fine, 2C/3A white girl hair.  </li>
            <li>its a lot of product and has a aroma that may put you off at first.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s funny</li>
            <li>so I would suggest a sample first (the website will send you some).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, we enjoy the styling benefits of Pillow Soft Curls and would purchase it again if Miss Jessie&#x27;s changed its fragrance.</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny, voluminous, curly, and overall lovely.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my hair relatively frizz-free and mostly defined</li>
            <li>I find that it doesn&#x27;t last more than a couple minutes however</li>
            <li>so I will probably keep looking for a similar more affordable option.  </li>
            <li>He says it smells better than a lot of the regular products I use.  </li>
            <li>Please note that I was pineappling my hair at night, and I exercised three times (intense cardio!).  </li>
            <li>First off, I am just now realizing this is a product designed for African-American hair.</li>
            <li>My curls don&#x27;t look as cute as they do when i do flattwists or just regular twist.</li>
            <li>For the first time in fifteen years, I&#x27;m not hiding it in a ponytail by the end of</li>
            <li>I love the way this product makes my hair look and feel, however, there is definitely a flake factor (as others have mentioned).</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be assuaged by the price as I first was.</li>
            <li>I am a black man and very stylish.</li>
            <li>I next tried Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls and love it!  </li>
            <li>It smells like a very sweet fabric softener, and the scent is heavy enough that people around my daughter comment on how her hair smells when she uses it -- and not in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I opt for a ton of flat ironing most of the time instead.</li>
            <li>i bought this and used it for several nights and my hair is soft, smooth and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>To be quite honest, I&#x27;ve used some of the cheaper products on the market that are not necessarily made for natural hair but are moisturizing, and they worked just as well.</li>
            <li>This is the first cream I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t look scrunchy or and it maeks my entire hair less frizzy so my baby hairs stay smooth and the top of the hair becomes smooth while the bottom is curly and has volume.</li>
            <li>My hair tends to puff out when dry, but when it is wet it has beautiful wringlets.</li>
            <li>I recieved my first tube of Super Soft curls as a gift.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant and long lasting as well.</li>
            <li>BUT im almost positive</li>
            <li>I read a positive review from a bi-racial reviewer on this product and decided to try.  </li>
            <li>I am an African American with relatively soft hair and this stuff works great on my hair.</li>
            <li>I unfortunately do not use as much as I need because I can&#x27;t tolerate smelling the perfume all day.</li>
            <li>I used way too much the first time and my hair was grease-ball city.  </li>
            <li>They would be full and soft but this time i dont know if its</li>
            <li>My hair just seemed kind of weighed down, which is probably what increased that drying time.  </li>
            <li>My curls are super curly and soft.</li>
            <li>I let it dry and magically my curls bounced into beauty and when I squeeze my hair</li>
            <li>I would constantly wear my hair up before this product, but now it looks pretty fabulous letting it do its thing</li>
            <li>If you haven’t tried it I strongly recommend you do, especially that it’s sulphate/petroleum…</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy this again and again, and I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because the smell is so strong.</li>
            <li>They could still benefit by making the scent a little more mild.</li>
            <li>course, everyone is different but this is the best product I&#x27;ve used so far, and my curls are usually out of control.  </li>
            <li>Works great for my thick curly hair!  </li>
            <li>have natural curl/waves that tend to disappear the moment it gets warm or dry.</li>
            <li>This lotion provides just enough hold for my fine, curly hair without crunch, shrinkage and flaking.</li>
            <li>The cost of the product (like most Miss Jessie&#x27;s products) is pretty steep, but the quality of the product is unlink any other that I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has such a crisp and clean scent that I often find myself pulling my hair close to my nose to breath it in.</li>
            <li>I shampooed my hair and applied a small amount, because some of the reviews said it smelled really strong if you used too much (I cannot tolerate really strong fragrances).</li>
            <li>Love this product, yes the fragrance is STRONG, the first day thought I would never use again, so next day I used less</li>
            <li>Not even close, it&#x27;s the real winner</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this, but it just did not work for me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like having to fuss with my hair a lot either, though.</li>
            <li>If you use too much, yes the smell can be over powering.</li>
            <li>but I was really bummed because it made my head itch uncontrollably.</li>
            <li>use it on the weekends when I don&#x27;t really care what my hair looks like.</li>
            <li>It was way too much and my hair looked greasy.</li>
            <li>I find the price to be too much for what you are getting too.</li>
            <li>My friend had recommended this product and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>It works really well to define curls and elimate frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>It can leave you hair with the stiffer feeling depending on home much you use.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t wash my hair very often.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it does much for frizz</li>
            <li>I have searched everywhere for a product that would work on my hair; I have combo curly/wavy hair, and it&#x27;s very frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and they would become straight.</li>
            <li>it works very well, however the smell of it gives me headaches.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t smell it much.  </li>
            <li>Hair is soft and looks neat, not crazy.</li>
            <li>but i was expecting a miracle to increase my curl volume from straightning it so much</li>
            <li>As the years went by, I started really hating the crunchy feeling</li>
            <li>Yes, it really does smell like Snuggle fabric softner, but I wasn&#x27;t too bothered by it.</li>
            <li>I also think it works better on wet hair rather than damp hair like the bottle suggest.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t really get that.</li>
            <li>: don&#x27;t use a whole lot.</li>
            <li>All I really use is about a dime/nickel sized amount</li>
            <li>I find that after using it a couple of times, I don&#x27;t mind it so much</li>
            <li>It keeps frizz away and keep my hair from tangling so much</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
            <li>Here is the real scoop on it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>My curls are bouncy and soft and I rarely get frizz now.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>The product is also very high-priced</li>
            <li>MANAGEBLE HAIR NOT HARD,CURLY WAVY OR STRAIGHT</li>
            <li>and she really loves it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely horrified.</li>
            <li>I will be sticking with my much cheaper Suave from now on.</li>
            <li>Not at all what it claims to do waist of too much money</li>
            <li>But I really wanted to use the PSC because of the fragrance.</li>
            <li>As someone who has dealt with her stubborn, curly hair her whole life, this product is the real deal.</li>
            <li>It gives you soft nice curls without frizz and without that wet crunchy look that gel &amp; mousse can give.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Basically, the PROS:helps achieve a nice curl; provides &amp;#34;just okay&amp;#34; softening (when compared to StaSofFro); will let you re-style for a few days before washing.</li>
            <li>Not only did this product do nothing for my naturally curly hair, but the smell was overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>I thinned it with some rose water, which is allowing me to use it up rather than have it go to waste.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;re big fans of Miss Jessie&#x27;s at our house, and love 99.9% of their products, but we won&#x27;t be buying Pillow Soft Curls again unless they change its fragrance.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair kind of heavy and sticky.</li>
            <li>The only hair product I&#x27;ve found that makes my curls soft, defined, and cute without frizz.</li>
            <li>I live in the hot, humid, sticky South</li>
            <li>I have been pretty dedicated to the Deva line, but I wanted to try something new.  </li>
            <li>Pillow soft hait is right.</li>
            <li>Smell wasnt as bad as most ppl made it sound, product went in and spread very easily.</li>
            <li>This product did cause major shrinkage but it was expected, put my hair in a puneapple at night to kind of strech it.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty sure this is something like Downey mixed with pomade because it looks, feels and definitely SMELLS like fabric softener.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s worth the investment!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than any other curl product I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t hear the uniquitous crackling you normally get with hair products for curls!  </li>
            <li>I bought this at a local retailer and was really excited to try it because it is aimed at producing looser, softer curls</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would love to try samples of their other products</li>
            <li>I have super fine hair and this product was too heavy</li>
            <li>( I can&#x27;t wash my hair everyday or it&#x27;ll dry out ) and smelled great the whole time.</li>
            <li>I have latin hair and most everyday curl, de-frizz products aren&#x27;t strong enough to manage the hair.  </li>
            <li>Very off putting smell, did not live up to it&#x27;s claims, more sticky then soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty thin but has nice curl to it if I use the right product and finally have found the right product!</li>
            <li>I really had high hopes for this curl cream.  </li>
            <li>first then I add the pillow soft lotion</li>
            <li>So all in all, my first attempt rates as an epic fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I probably use about a quarter sized amount total for my full head of hair.</li>
            <li>But, what I really want is smooth, loose waves that aren&#x27;t crunchy/ soaked in product or frizzy and of control.</li>
            <li>If you have very fine hair that gets limp and at times stringy, go for a gel instead.</li>
            <li>My hair is in a transition phase of a faded keratin treatment and new, very curly hair coming in.</li>
            <li>They are less on the ramen-noodle side and more on the corkscrew side.</li>
            <li>I have a suave product that is half the price and works much better.</li>
            <li>I seriously never review products.</li>
            <li>Luckily the smell only lasts a day</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t have the same result as Miss Jessie&#x27;s Quick Curls.  </li>
            <li>Mainly focus on putting it on the ends.</li>
            <li>I have only used it a few times now, but I think this is as good as my curls are going to get.  </li>
            <li>so they look decent.</li>
            <li>then I&#x27;m super frizzy with 3 different textures on my head.  </li>
            <li>I am glad to finally have found something that actually works.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only do I smell amazing all day long, my curly hair is soft and luscious.</li>
            <li>Usually i let my hair air dry to keep curls defined but even with a diffuser it worked great.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Still, this gets high ratings from me.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s high praise in man-words.</li>
            <li>so I recommend a quick wash in the morning before you re-apply the product and be sure to do a thorough wash each week (for those of us with natural hair who tend to wash less frequently as to not dry out the scalp and hair).</li>
            <li>the sleep-on-it result a little better.</li>
            <li>The cute curls are not worth the slimy feeling!</li>
            <li>It tames my curls and makes them so soft!!  </li>
            <li>I have extremely fine hair, but my curls make it appear thick and full.</li>
            <li>Initially I was a little put off by the comparison to fabric softener, but in practice I find the scent to be fresh and not at all overwhelming.</li>
            <li>However, by the middle of the day they were looking a little rough and this product makes my hair feel incredibly greasy.</li>
            <li>My main concern/goal whenever I&#x27;m looking for a new product is curl definition without that crunchy result.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to respond to this comment if you need advice, but I am telling you this is a great product and you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li>This really does give soft curls.  </li>
            <li>It does give me more defined curls, and after its dried I run my fingers through it to loosen up the crunchiness.</li>
            <li>I normally bought at Target</li>
            <li>made my hair feel icky smelled nice though</li>
            <li>Straightening my hair took longer than normal.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it did weigh my type 3a hair down and did not define my curls, took away from my hair&#x27;s natural volume, but this may be a great product for denser curls to ease them more.</li>
            <li>I love that is doesn&#x27;t make your hair crunchy, but the smell is so odd!</li>
            <li>NO HARD</li>
            <li>do think that this is worth a try, just because some of the poor results I experienced may be due to my hair type (between 4a &amp;4b).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any stronger than any other hair product, and it smells REALLY good and &amp;#34;clean.&amp;#34; I definitely recommend this product if your hair is similar to mine.</li>
            <li>I have 2c-3a colored, right above the shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li>I took it right back and returned it.</li>
            <li>And now I am back to trying to find just the right product all over again.  </li>
            <li>Got this as a gift and it left a film on my hair and just didnt feel right, so i washed out immediately</li>
            <li>I find that this product only really works to its full potential only when freshly washing conditioning your hair.  </li>
            <li>It transfers to my skin and hands easily during the day (yuck) and runs down my face when working out.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li>it created an entirely new look for me</li>
            <li>My problem is, I need to stop trying new products and stick with what works.</li>
            <li>My new fav product.</li>
            <li>This product defines my curls and weighs down the flyaways enough that my hair actually looks good.</li>
            <li>Not stiff at all!</li>
            <li>I put this in right after my shower while my hair is still wet and either sleep on it or just let it air dry and both work great, although I usually like</li>
            <li>My curls were hideous and my hair felt very gunky yet very puffy and big.</li>
            <li>This product creates soft non-frizzy curls and you don&#x27;t even need to use a lot; in fact you don&#x27;t want to use a lot because I learned early on that using too much makes your hair a bit sticky.</li>
            <li>Indeed, very soft curls.</li>
            <li>They look so natural and feel so soft!!</li>
            <li>The smell is really strong and not worth any &amp;#34;pillow soft curls&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s what Jessie&#x27;s pillow soft curls gave me!</li>
            <li>This is one I’m sticking to as far as I can see!</li>
            <li>My curls are defined but soft!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve EVER had 2nd day curls.</li>
            <li>Finally this is one that does exactly what it says it will.</li>
            <li>You definitely don&#x27;t need much!</li>
            <li>Soft curls without having to use a ton of product!</li>
            <li>Bought my first and only bottle at Walgreens (also sold at Target).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had such pretty, well defined curls until this product.  </li>
            <li>It does hold the curl, but it feels &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; (hair doesn&#x27;t feel clean, can&#x27;t do anything with it the next day when I want to put it up b/c it feels gross).</li>
            <li>I can usually get my hair to be a strong 2B or a possible 2C curl if I use the right product.</li>
            <li>apply about two peas worth, work through the hair, scrunch a bit, and allow to air dry.</li>
            <li>I usually use Kinky-Curly products but became intrigued about what Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls claimed to be able to do.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still working on figuring out exactly how much and how wet the hair needs to be for optimal results.</li>
            <li>I got Pillow Soft Curls from my local Target and used it for the first time today.</li>
            <li>I had to pull my hair back (after checking with a coworker to make sure other people couldn&#x27;t smell it!).  </li>
            <li>While I&#x27;ll notice minimal curls form in my hair after first application, the curls/waves quickly fall flat, leaving a disheveled appearance in my hair.</li>
            <li>The only positive thing I can say about this product is</li>
            <li>It is better for use on wet hair than dry.</li>
            <li>AND I don&#x27;t have to use half the bottle on my lower back lengthed hair like most products.  </li>
            <li>so when I use product, I usually run out pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>It did keep my hair very soft and was not the least bit crunchy, but it is probably much better for tighter curls or thicker hair types.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit high priced for what it does, which doesn&#x27;t really seem like much to me, I still have to add in other hair product to get my hair to not look frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I barely crunched as I put it on and had decently curly hair.</li>
            <li>Doing so will probably cut back on the scent (if it&#x27;s too strong for some people), decrease the build-up and overall make it last longer to justify the price.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way in damp hair, and curls can be quickly refreshed with a quick spritz of water.</li>
            <li>Have not been able to have medium length hair FOR YEARS because it turns to frizz, and I have tried gazillions of non-frizz and other products, most of them expensive and high end.</li>
            <li>You can even refresh the curls the next day with a little water and a tad more product.</li>
            <li>Clearly smells like a bottled of downy fabric softener.</li>
            <li>Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls is the product I&#x27;ve been searching for, and believe me, I&#x27;ve been on a twenty-year hair product search.</li>
            <li>The liquid from Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls was all over the book.  </li>
            <li>It does what it promises, makes my curls soft and defined.  </li>
            <li>My daughter and I both have naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>This gave me well defined soft curls for my wavy/curly hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Thought I would try Jelly Soft Curls brand because it was cheaper ($14)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not as offended by the smell as some, and I&#x27;m sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li>the last perm i got really fried my hair</li>
            <li>when i wash my hair it feels so soft and conditioned.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my curls soft and popping.</li>
            <li>No build up with this product and my hair is soft and curly.</li>
            <li>I use about two nickel size dollops and gently rake my hands through my hair (very gently to not totally separate the curls), then I used a tiny dollop of Aveda&#x27;s Be Curly, and gently scrunched.</li>
            <li>It also feels like I have something completely coating my hair.</li>
            <li>I applied Cantu Shea Butter Leave In Conditioning Cream, then Trader Joe&#x27;s jojoba oil, then a dime-sized amount of Pillow Soft Curls.</li>
            <li>Today is the 2nd day and my curls are still defined (I pull my hair straight up into an old pair of stockings to sleep in), they are moisturized, and soft (any crunchiness is gone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have decided to try and grow my hair out which means curly, heat free hair for a few months.  </li>
            <li>Stayed soft all day</li>
            <li>Soft curls with no build up and no greasiness.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to smell do not buy, every time I turn my head</li>
            <li>My curls are soft, shiny, and bouncy.</li>
            <li>but when you run your fingers through the curls they get soft and not frizzy</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s not heavy like gel</li>
            <li>It keeps my daughters hair really soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly and wild, and I have struggled for years and years trying to find a product that gives me the look I want.</li>
            <li>The lotion leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>There is no built up on my hair and my hair is pillow soft just as adveristed.</li>
            <li>So, yes, it does help &amp;#34;encourage&amp;#34; (their claim) the curls, and it does make the hair feel soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried around 50 products of ALL price ranges and this one takes the cake by far.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>Nothing works like Pillow Soft curls.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never seen my curls so frizz-free, silky soft, and bouncy.</li>
            <li>I was completely amazed.</li>
            <li>There are many comments here about the scent, but I use it sparingly and it doesn&#x27;t bother me in the least.</li>
            <li>As a person with naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my hair so soft that I even use it when I&#x27;m going to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>Just like it says, they will be soft curls.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m liking this product a lot so far.  </li>
            <li>But this stuff kept my curls in place, soft, and non frizzy all day...</li>
            <li>I ordered the product because I wanted to add some body and strength to my natural kinky hair.</li>
            <li>I tried Pillow Soft Curls by Miss Jessie&#x27;s because it helps preserve the soft curls that I have when I exit the shower.</li>
            <li>I just wanted my hair to feel soft to the touch but still curly.</li>
            <li>i have sensitive skin and the &#x27;laundry detergent&amp;#34; in it made my face break out (where my hair would touch my face)&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;i would buy it again IF i didnt have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I purchased Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls this week from Target.</li>
            <li>I was hoping that this product would provide soft control and definition for my curls/waves.  </li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to fragrance, do not buy this.</li>
            <li>I have caucasian hair with natural wave.</li>
            <li>It definitely smells like laundry detergent, but I really like the smell (as does my husband).</li>
            <li>Since going natural, I have made this product one of my regulars.  </li>
            <li>my curls still be soft and playable) than crunchy hair.</li>
            <li>This product made my hair soft and defined my curls just like it said.  </li>
            <li>Soft, silky, 2b waves.  </li>
            <li>This help me to wash and go with soft hair instead of crunch an crust.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by the comments on the smell -- someone nailed it and said it smells like fabric softener</li>
            <li>enter Pillow Soft Curls.  </li>
            <li>This product gives you what it states &amp;#34;pillow, soft curls&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I am 40 years old and have been using &amp;#34;Curly Perm&amp;#34; Activator Lotion since I was 15 years old.  </li>
            <li>I ha e naturally curly hair that I wet-set for manageability.</li>
            <li>I used it once with my hair drying naturally</li>
            <li>The Pillow Soft curls does just that - soft curls.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>I do have Pillow Soft Curls.</li>
            <li>This made my curls so soft.  </li>
            <li>This makes it really soft and not greasy</li>
            <li>This product made my hair so soft.  </li>
            <li>It reminds me of an old lady going to church.</li>
            <li>My DH doesn&#x27;t like it either - so much so that he&#x27;s commented on it several times.</li>
            <li>I can mist my hair with water and apply this and my curls are defined and soft</li>
            <li>As far as the smell, it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>Natural hair.  </li>
            <li>I had ordered the Miss Jesse&#x27;s pillow soft curls but it just sat in my drawer because I had already decided to give the wash and go&#x27;s a rest.</li>
            <li>It has caused me to wash my hair more frequently that I probably should, which with thick curly hair, you know can be an issue as well.</li>
            <li>The smell is very strong and not pleasant.  </li>
            <li>it seems a little heavy if you use too much and the scent is VERY STRONG of laundry soap/softener.</li>
            <li>I blow dry with a round brush and my hair is soft and frizz free and has nice big round curls where I put them.  </li>
            <li>Maybe if you have super dry hair this will work for you, but my normal to dry hair does not like it one bit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Beware that if you have fine hair, the ingredients in this product might possibly weigh it down.</li>
            <li>It left my fine 2B/2C hair weighed down and</li>
            <li>and I still have half a bottle left which means this product has lasted much longer than others (and is therefore worth the price to me) and my curls are soft, not crunchy.</li>
            <li>I have found the most success using this on very wet hair, a little goes a long way and when I don&#x27;t diffuse.  </li>
            <li>I have searched high and low for something that does what miss Jessie&#x27;s does.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much of a natural curl right now, because I&#x27;ve recently had my hair relaxed, but if I but a dab of this on my hair with curlers and let it dry,</li>
            <li>#34;shellac&amp;#34; setting when my hair dried; however, when I used it on dry hair, I had better results.</li>
            <li>What I usually do is shower, brush out my hair, coil it into a bun and secure it in place.  </li>
            <li>It also has a different scent from normal hair products which I like a lot.</li>
            <li>it will be back to normal.</li>
            <li>I let my hair air-dry and it ended up a little crunchy, but some quick scrunching took care of that.</li>
            <li>so I rarely wear my hair down anymore.</li>
            <li>Trying to get me a new regimen going on, and this is definitely included as part of my calming detangling sessions.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought the product was nice due to not leaving my hair &#x27;crunchy&#x27; to bad the body didn&#x27;t stay for more than 20 minutes and regular products keep my hair curly all day long.</li>
            <li>After purchasing a new product every time I ran out of the old one, I finally purchased a second Pillow Soft Curls.</li>
            <li>This product does a great job of giving my curls definition, cutting back on the frizz, without leaving any crunch.  </li>
            <li>I combed a very generous amount of this through my damp hair and proceeded to tousle and blow dry my hair with a diffuser.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice it once my hair is dry.</li>
            <li>This company makes multiple products but for Caucasian hair that is very curly I couldn&#x27;t recommend this product enough.</li>
            <li>I have small waves which get very frizzy because of hair dyes and hot tools.</li>
            <li>I also had a bit of build-up from it the next day, but I didn&#x27;t mind that so much because I just re-wetted my hair a bit and used up whatever product was left in my hair from the day before.  </li>
            <li>I let my hair air-dry as much as possible and only use a blowdryer/diffuser if really pressed for time.  </li>
            <li>I have type 3 curly thick blonde hair and bought this to see if I could get a bit more volume with a lighter cream product.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t loved all of Miss Jessie&#x27;s products; some are too thick or heavy, even for my 3B hair.</li>
            <li>It does not weigh my hair down, but leaves it bouncy and with just the right amount of definition.  </li>
            <li>This product definitely makes hair very soft, and does not make it crunchy.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>that actually makes my curly hair look and feel pillow soft!</li>
            <li>I get major shrinkage when i wash my hair and it stays like that for about 3 days b4</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product does have a strong smell that&#x27;s similar to fabric softener, but it&#x27;s not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I use as directed, starting with freshly washed hair that I only squeezed dry (towels create frizz).</li>
            <li>I thought maybe the smell would dissipate as my hair dried, but several hours later it was still so strong</li>
            <li>My curls are a &amp;#34;tybe b&amp;#34; and can be very dry and very frizzy.</li>
            <li>Makes my grand daughters curls soft and fluffy, rather than tightly cured.  </li>
            <li>I have a huge complaint with the shipping department at amazon.  </li>
            <li>it brought my natural curls back to life!</li>
            <li>I washed and deep conditioned my hair, then applied the Pillow Soft Curls.</li>
            <li>Until now, defined and soft had only been an oxymoron for my curls.</li>
            <li>and they are such soft curls</li>
            <li>I used to use a leave-in spray conditioner that left my hair curly yet soft, but can&#x27;t find it any longer.  </li>
            <li>and it was the same thing - soft curls.  </li>
            <li>It defined my naturally curly hair and manages the frizz at the same time!!!</li>
            <li>My curls were shiny, soft and defined, with a tiny, but acceptable amount of frizz.  </li>
            <li>I am white, 67 years old with dyed (red) naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>They were soft once dried however on that first day.</li>
            <li>; when I tried to straighten my hair after almost 3 weeks of curls and continued use of this product, my hair was waaay more difficult than normal.</li>
            <li>A full bottle lasts me about 3 months - I am caucasion and have curly hair about 2 inches past my shoulders.</li>
            <li>I was using Miss Jessie&#x27;s Quick Curls but found that it left my curly hair a little crunchier than I would like.  </li>
            <li>I can generally go about 3 days in between washes, but with this product I find myself having to wash every 2 days, or use a whole lot of dry shampoo on day 3 and pull it back.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m tired of getting stuck with these natural hair products that don&#x27;t work, or their fragrances are overwhelmingly strong.  </li>
            <li>The curls are soft not hard like other products.</li>
            <li>very soft, bouncy curls and my hair is about 3 inches long.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to explain the consistency of the product, it is not gel or mousse, it is more of a mixture of a runny lotion, it does not make your hands sticky and you only need about a table spoon for long hair.</li>
            <li>Not worth the money, and pretty much not worth it at all.</li>
            <li>- maybe I&#x27;m not using as much of the product as other folks.  </li>
            <li>Other than the fast shipping this product lives up to its name.</li>
            <li>And many african american hair products are very heavy and make my hair loose its bounce and movement.  </li>
            <li>All I do to revive my whole look is to dampen my hair, put a little leave in conditioner, and finally pillow soft, run my fingers thru my hair, and I&#x27;m off.  </li>
            <li>It produces a defined curl that is still soft, not stiff or &amp;#34;crunchy.&amp;#34; And don&#x27;t let the high pricetag fool you- a little bit of this stuff goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, however, for as long as I can remember</li>
            <li>i have long naturally wavy hair</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>I owned this product for a while, and my first take was that it was too heavy.</li>
            <li>I have tried probably a hundred different products, both expensive as well as inexpensive and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>It comes in a decent sized bottle and since you only need a minimal amount it lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li>I have very thick, long, curly, and more than anything, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>Leaves curls soft and holds the curl for a very long time....</li>
            <li>If u have long natural hair with tiny curls this may work as</li>
            <li>I also have SUPER thick strands and LOTS of them</li>
            <li>I have long, fine naturally curly hair that if I put too much stuff in, it looks stringy and crazy but if I don&#x27;t put anything</li>
            <li>I have very thick, coarse hair that rarely gets greasy, but this stuff took it to a new level.  </li>
            <li>Just curls that are loose and soft.</li>
            <li>I sectioned my hair and applied a leave in conditioner (Giovanni) and then a little less than a dime sized amount of the Pillow Soft- all in all, about three dimes worth to my head.</li>
            <li>and if I take the time to dry it I can create big soft curls with no stiffness.  </li>
            <li>sister has fine thin hair and she loves it</li>
            <li>recommend it to anyone who has thick, frizzy, curly hair who wants curls that are big, soft, and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product!</li>
            <li>With this, I was only able to achieve 2A hair, very weak waves.</li>
            <li>But since I only wash my hair 2-3 times a week, I&#x27;m willing to live with it those few days and not deduct any stars (I would take off a half star if I could).</li>
            <li>If I get another sample, or a smaller tube of it, I will definitely dilute it with a little water, or, I just won&#x27;t use as much of it.  </li>

            <li> Smells really good.  </li>
            <li> Works fairly well -</li>
            <li> It seems like it would be a good detangler if for nothing else.</li>
            <li> But this gives it beautiful shape while being able to run my fingers through it.  </li>
            <li> It smells great and my hair has great volume and the curls/waves tighten up nicely with no crunchy feeling. :)</li>

            <li> and this works amazing.</li>
            <li> There has been a lot of shrinkage, and I would not say my curls are a lot looser, but the definition and shine is amazing.</li>

            <li> going to order more of their products to see if they work as good.</li>
            <li> Does a nice job of defining curls and keeping hairstyle in place.</li>
            <li> that at the beginning of the day my curls were defined and looked rather nice.</li>
            <li> I recommend giving this one a try, it may work well for you on its own, or in combination with another product.</li>
            <li> people also mention how nice it smells.</li>
            <li> I get compliments all the time on how nice my hair smells (go figure)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> This is totally awesome, and it sounds great, definitely get it....</li>
            <li> One of the best products for soft curls!!!</li>
            <li> All in all, this is the best product that I&#x27;ve ever used and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty curly but the way this defines adds softness and shine and bounce is incredible.</li>
            <li> Very strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my naturally curly hair!</li>
            <li> After using a curling iron and damaging my hair, I&#x27;ve been working towards getting the top starts to curl more rather than wave and this stuff helps a lot!</li>
            <li> Pillow Soft Curls is the best styling product I&#x27;ve ever used on my curls, and gives me the very best 2nd day hair I&#x27;ve ever had (usually, my first day is the best).</li>
            <li> My hair is shinny supersoft, defined curls AND holds the light clean smell ALL day!!!</li>
            <li> Curls is by far the best.....</li>
            <li> great for curly hair with a fun smell</li>
            <li> Both my husband and son have naturally curly hair and this product works great to make their hair tamed!</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and curly, works great!</li>
            <li> The product has a nice creamy texture and I love the smell</li>
            <li> The smell is strong - fortunately, it smells great.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> The smell is so strong!  </li>
            <li> I like the smell, but it is very strong (smells like fabric softener, as many say).</li>
            <li> Love Love Love Love!</li>
            <li> Plus the smell is amazing and clean!</li>
            <li> This lotion is great for me because my hair isn&#x27;t exactly curly, but it still needs hold</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine, curly in some places and more crimped-looking in others.  </li>
            <li> Kinda beachy and super easy!!</li>
            <li> The product I love, have been using it for 2 years and still like the way it works in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products including all the name brands.</li>
            <li> Some work better than others but Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow&lt;br /&gt;Soft</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product to encourage my hair to curl without being frizzy.</li>
            <li> And it smells like a spa :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not quite sure how I feel about this.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> It smells like fabric softener (I love the smell btw) because it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;fabric</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> She guaranteed that I would love this product</li>
            <li> etc free so it will not hurt!</li>
            <li> I still add a bit of Oribe&#x27;s gel serum for a better definition and that creates the most defined and tamed look.</li>
            <li> and i love smelling my hair all afternoon.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and gives just enough definition.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m that over the top about or whether I just don&#x27;t want to take the time to do it.</li>
            <li> This worked ok, still had spots of frizz and the smell of this is for sure overpowering.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I got a sample from BirchBox to try and I fell in love with this curl creme.</li>
            <li> Mostly because I&#x27;ve never found that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products including Ms. Jessie&#x27;s Curl Meringue, Curly pudding, and Butter Creme.</li>
            <li> I love how this works for my curls -</li>
            <li> love this hair lotion.</li>
            <li> I love the scent</li>
            <li> I was hoping i&#x27;d be able to just throw this product in and it would make my hair wavier</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I have medium length wavy hair that is frizz prone and inconsistent, but this product seems to have tamed it (most of the time).&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> Absolutely love my curls when I use this product.</li>
            <li> Curls, curls and more curls.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that there is a product out there that will &amp;#34;encourage&amp;#34; my curls without making my wallet sob.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe it will work better for those with a bit finer texture?</li>
            <li> I seriously love this product.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite curly hair product I&#x27;ve used in years</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I used to really love how miss jessie would leave my curls.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  feels nice &amp; light.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to get more.</li>
            <li> I love Miss Jessie&#x27;s products, but this one did not suit my hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but do not see a noticable hold or impact whether i use or not, i will probably use more as a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> i love that my hair doesnt feel tangly...</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> While it didn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy like most curl creams do, it doesn&#x27;t make it &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My hair curled better without the product in.</li>
            <li> Love that I no longer have crunchy hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> This better not get discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I looooooove this and reccomend this product to everyone :-)</li>
            <li> I also love the smell.</li>
            <li> Spray some water on my strands then coat it with this stuff, and the slip and texture of my hair is astonishing.</li>
            <li> That being said, I love how my hair feels.  </li>
            <li> MY FAVORITE PRODUCT FOR MY DAUGHTER&#x27;S CURLY HAIR.....</li>
            <li> but I spend more on all the products I used to buy and get s***ty results.</li>
            <li> looks so cute</li>
            <li> This totally fit the bill!</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous!</li>
            <li> The scent of the cream is lovely.</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels and smells.  </li>
            <li> I sent away for it and am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> Better off using eco styler gel.</li>
            <li> so I have to use more than what they recommend but it works better than frizzease.</li>
            <li> Its not horrible, but it is overpowering and probably would not complement most perfumes or lotions.  </li>
            <li> This is possibly the best hair product I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> The top layers are the hardest to curl and</li>
            <li> This product is just OK.  </li>
            <li> - sure it&#x27;s like fabric softener</li>
            <li> Diffuse is okay</li>
            <li> I really really love this product.  </li>
            <li> Miss Jessie, consider a better fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I really love this product and encourage ANY person with curly hair to try it.</li>
            <li> This one I love</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I sampled this product &amp; fell in love.</li>
            <li> I used to do wash and go&#x27;s for the most part but the detangling was a production on wash days</li>
            <li> I love the scent.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Love love LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally happy, and my cabinet thanks me.  </li>
            <li> My hair has just the right amount of volume and it&#x27;s been day 2 and my hair is still looking good.</li>
            <li> said, I found the smell to be clean and nice.</li>
            <li> I got this specifically because people were complaining of the strong, fabric softener scent since I happen to love that smell, and wanted a product to get a bit more wear out of my unwashed hair.</li>
            <li> Great change form my normal routine</li>
            <li> Awesome for long curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It smells pretty good, almost like Downy or laundry detergent.</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad at all, in fact it is quite nice.  </li>
            <li> I liked this product, it smells good, it makes my hair really soft and curly!</li>
            <li> This works perfectly: I put a small-ish dollop through and just scrunched a lot and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> I could use more, but the smell is quite strong.</li>
            <li> however this products makes my hair very soft and it smells so great.</li>
            <li> the best part is I just spray my hair with a little water the next day, add a smig more product (about 1/2 a tablespoon) and the results are JUST as good!!!</li>
            <li> I was happy with the way my hair looked the day I used this product, but the scent of it was just too much - there was a very strong chemical smell right from the start.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing, and worth the price!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use about a quarter size on wet hair and then diffuse for best results.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for anyone with natural wave or curl in their hair.  </li>
            <li> It not only keeps my waves looking shiny and in tact, but it smells incredible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still experimenting with it - with slightly better results when I mix it with some cheap</li>
            <li> The curls were soft and looked great.  </li>
            <li> This product  leave my hair so soft, and it smells great- like baby powder.</li>
            <li> So far has worked great in my hair</li>
            <li> I did notice a bit more shrinkage with using this product, probably because it is so light.  </li>
            <li> SO I TOOK CHANCE AND TRIED IT  SO FAR HAPPY WITH IT</li>
            <li> If you can deal with your hair kind of, sort of smelling like a dryer sheet, it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s kind of pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> Specially hair stuff!  </li>
            <li> My hair is very fine (but full) and wavy.</li>
            <li> Also, the scent is very sweet and strong.</li>
            <li> I thought the price was a little high for a prodcut I never heard of, but it was the best chance i took on a great result.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a sample 1oz packet before shelling out $25 for a full sized tube, and even that was $7!</li>
            <li> It leaves curls bouncy and full and waves luscious!</li>
            <li> I also have the best second-day hair I&#x27;ve had with any other product.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I rarely give 5 stars to anything!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of enough words to describe how good this product is!</li>
            <li> At best is might have reduced the frizz in my hair but other than</li>
            <li> Knits fell out so easily and actually loved the fabric softener scent of this particular one</li>
            <li> so I ordered from Amazon and the product was delivered very quickly....</li>
            <li> The smell is ok, it smells like clean laundry (maybe even febreze).</li>
            <li> I did not find it overwhelming at all, and just smells clean to me.  </li>
            <li> but I love the smell of clean laundry</li>
            <li> it smells like fabric softener, but the smell disappears very quickly.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it is too strong</li>
            <li> it actually is so strong i have gotten a headache or two.</li>
            <li> This product really promotes lovely curls on the longer part and adds some nice texture to the rest.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the scent, but it IS strong and DOES smell like fabric softener.</li>
            <li> I had read that the smell was strong, but thought I would try it anyway.  </li>
            <li> It smells like fabric softener and its so strong</li>
            <li> smell was strong and could not use this</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel the smell was too strong</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a hair product smell so strongly of perfume.</li>
            <li> Its just not as strong as I was led to believe.  </li>
            <li> The result is beautifully shaped, soft, full, NON-frizzy and NON-crunchy curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So if you can&#x27;t handle strong fragrance, this probably isn&#x27;t the product for you.</li>
            <li> It DOES smell like fabric softener, but I did not find it to be too offensive or strong, and it has dissipated a lot since drying.</li>
            <li> Strong fabric softener is not something I want my hair to smell like.  </li>
            <li> The scent is fairly strong, and that is probably a turn off for a lot of people.  </li>
            <li> I have read a lot of reviews where it&#x27;s just too strong for some people</li>
            <li> Yes, it has a strong perfume scent -</li>
            <li> Although the smell is strong-</li>
            <li> but the scent is EXTREMELY STRONG</li>
            <li> but I thought it was too strong.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not that strong anymore....</li>
            <li> The smell is really strong.</li>
            <li> , it isn&#x27;t strong and doesn&#x27;t seem to clash with perfume.</li>
            <li> every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got a fairly strong scent, but I like it.</li>
            <li> It does NOT have a strong smell like some of the reviews</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame, too, because I know my hair could be beautiful if it the curls were defined properly.  </li>
            <li> The best part is it&#x27;s cruelty free, so it&#x27;s a product I feel good about putting my hard-earned dollars behind.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best.</li>
            <li> but I love sweet scents so it worked out fine for me.  </li>
            <li> This is the best, hands down.</li>
            <li> The AG Recoil gives just enough hold, the Pillow Soft gives great soft-curl definition and smells very nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Caucasian with fine wavy/curly hair.</li>
            <li> But if you use a drop about the size of a dime or less, it will be perfect.</li>
            <li> I have fine, medium curly hair.</li>
            <li> curly bob, with fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li> Because my hair is so fine, I let it air-dry</li>
            <li> Possibly better for leople with super curly hair as I just have wavy.</li>
            <li> I save so much time in the morning not having to straighten my hair, and my hair is now in much better condition and is growing faster, now that I&#x27;m not frying it every day!</li>
            <li> This does a great job of defining the curls without a lot of frizz while still being super soft-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m falling in love with my hair for the first time ever!</li>
            <li> It Takes The Frizz Out Of My Daughters Kinky Curls and makes her curls into these perfect little spirals.</li>
            <li> Probably one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used, as far as leaving me with soft, defrizzed curls.  </li>
            <li> A few months ago Redbook Magazine ran an article on the Best Beauty Buys available in 2013.</li>
            <li> and when i don&#x27;t...soft hair that feels and smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> It is a light hold and does not leave my hair looking greasy</li>
            <li> (your curls come out smooth, shiny &amp; well defined)</li>
            <li> One day, I stumbled upon a review for this product on Makeup Alley (my go-to place for honest reviews besides Amazon) and everyone was absolutely RAVING about this product, even the wild-maned girls.</li>
            <li> I do enjoy the fabric softener smell however.</li>
            <li> those days I really need to look amazing.</li>
            <li> But I love that I can go 2 days without washing my hair because it is not greasy or gummy and the smell is still fresh.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the cream is light in weight and density, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about the cream creating an oily/greasy appearance on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good for soft hair.</li>
            <li> I wish the product provided a tad more volume for my thinning hair, but overall it does a good job.</li>
            <li> I gave 3 stars cuz It does smell good like fabric softener and it makes your hair soft.</li>
            <li> If you buy this product, I would strongly suggest applying sparingly the first time and working your way up to using more, until you find an amount that works for you.  </li>
            <li> but I had to give this product 4 stars because the smell is so sweet and strong</li>
            <li> but omg it is a very powerful laundry smell.</li>
            <li> I do admit that the smell is very powerful out of the tube.  </li>
            <li> Miss Jessie&#x27;s Super Soft Pillow Soft Curls was named The Best Curl Definer for Thick/Coarse Hair.</li>
            <li> For moisture, I find that the very reasonably priced StaSofFro works MUCH better (without a residue).</li>
            <li> I am so glad I came across this product, I tried it out and my curls are soft and for the most part frizz free.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I had read all the rave reviews and was so excited to use it.</li>
            <li> It smells like fresh linens!</li>
            <li> It does smell wonderful, like Downy, but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> in all I say it&#x27;s totally worth the money!  </li>
            <li> Original bought it for my styles but didn&#x27;t like how it felt on my hair.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> So worth the money!..</li>
            <li> I have a mixture of 4a &amp; 4c hair type,  I usually have to twist or flattwist my hair with product to get define curls, the Miss Jessie&#x27;s Curling Pudding worked best for me.</li>
            <li> I had to clean everything off before I could read the book or use the product.  </li>
            <li> It smells so clean.</li>
            <li> Yes it has a clean, fabric softener smell.  </li>
            <li> It smells clean</li>
            <li> But it a clean smell</li>
            <li> While an OK product, it doesn&#x27;t really lengthen or smooth curls.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, am soooo thrilled that I finally found something that works!</li>
            <li> I just smell really clean all the time I guess.</li>
            <li> I read about this product in Allure Magazine and even though I tend to be frugal, I sprung for the elevated pricetag to try Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls, and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li> and she was right!</li>
            <li> : I found the right combo!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s exactly right!  </li>
            <li> When it dries, it has a nice beachy wave look to it, and it&#x27;s soft (not crunchy) and clean feeling to the touch.</li>
            <li> but some how makes hair dry quickly which is great for wash and go.  </li>
            <li> Beautiful natural not stiff curls is what you have wearing this product</li>
            <li> My naturally curly hair looks and feels amazing with this product.  </li>
            <li> It makes it feel so soft and defines my twist out amazingly.</li>
            <li> I finished my usual curl product that I was supremely happy with and should have ordered more...</li>
            <li> Lately I have been on a mission to find the best products for my type 3a curly hair and decided to try this product after having read the reviews.  </li>
            <li> I got a deluxe sample size of this pillow soft curl cream from my  monthly Birchbox subscription.</li>
            <li> I apply the product about a dime size at a time and make sure not to touch it/style it too much</li>
            <li> To fe fair, I am a big fan of unscented beauty products.</li>
            <li> This leaves my curly hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Loving Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls.</li>
            <li> I think this is probably because it&#x27;s made with avocado, coconut, sweet almond, and olive</li>
            <li> Waiting for my full size to arrive.</li>
            <li> The scent is quite strong - it smells exactly like liquid fabric softener.  </li>
            <li> I have no problem with the smell, at first it was strong</li>
            <li> Other days I put it in after a shower and run out of the house and it still dries and looks great without the use of bed heads product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty sure I have 3a/3b naturally brown curls but with some heat damage on the top strands.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length fine hair and my curls were noticably crisp</li>
            <li> It smells like clean clothes, fresh out of the dryer, and it does fade over the course of the day.</li>
            <li> But who doesn&#x27;t like the smell of fresh clean laundry??</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have super curly hair, just wavy to medium curls.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I have super powers.</li>
            <li> I would most definitely buy this product once more.</li>
            <li> I use this along with the Miss Jessie&#x27;s Super Slip Sudsy Shampoo and the DevaCare One Condition, No-Fade Ultra Creamy Conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t super curly</li>
            <li> a quick wash n go cuz it does serve as a curl activator</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> For my first attempt, I decided I would use it on its own because I think a product that costs $22 should be able to work a little magic by itself.</li>
            <li> but wow!I have always had the crunchy, noodle curl and this left my fine curly hair defined, soft, and smelling great.</li>
            <li> This is my very first review of any product on Amazon; I have been a prime member for two years.</li>
            <li> First of all, it smells fantastic, like a Downy dryer sheet.</li>
            <li> A small peach pit size amount seems to be my ideal amount to define curl, and keep the grease to a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason I gave it only 4 stars is because the fragrance is very overwhelming, but I still use the heck out of the product anyway.</li>
            <li> Live and learn :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using less, but I don&#x27;t get great results and still have the residual greasiness from it.</li>
            <li> I first tried this product by itself, about a quarter sized amount, it did not provide enough hold to give good definition.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I have actually heard about this a long time ago through my best friend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy and controls frizz pretty well along with adding a nice shine.  </li>
            <li> and I find that a small amount, maybe 1 tbsp, enhances my curls and leaves them nice, soft, and smelling great.  </li>
            <li> My hair is untammable and its pretty well tamed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I received this as a full size for free because if I actually paid money for this I would be livid.  </li>
            <li> I have wavy unruly hair and this is the only product to date in my 51 years that has tamed my hair and made me love having wavy hair!  </li>
            <li> Love it and leaves your hair super soft.</li>
            <li> Fine, straight-wavy, and much shorter.</li>
            <li> I have fine, medium thick curly/wavy hair and this product works great.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t return it, I&#x27;ve used up 90% of the bottle and have had great results, although because of the cost, I don&#x27;t use it everyday, I use a leave in conditioner or refresher products along with my oils (almond, coconut, evoo and glycerin mix).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really does a fantastic job controlling the lioness mane.</li>
            <li> Always looking for something to define the curls and calm the friz, this doesn&#x27;t do either.</li>
            <li> and this really does leave my hair nice and soft and</li>
            <li> well worth it.</li>
            <li> Paying the price is totally worth it</li>
            <li> I am going natural and I love this product.  </li>
            <li> My curls end up feeling soft, and it controls most of the frizz.</li>
            <li> Smells almost like fresh linen or laundry detergent</li>
            <li> Like many reviewers here have said, it does smell a bit like fabric softener, so if you&#x27;re sensitive to that, don&#x27;t get it.  </li>
            <li> I have gotten a lot of compliments on the fresh smell of my hair.</li>
            <li> and this is by far the top of all products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> if i wanna look like i did any kind of styling to it, i twist a section of it and clip it back .</li>
            <li> even the next day my hair has a nice fresh smell to it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the fabric softener smell, either.</li>
            <li> I am not crazy about the smell, however.  </li>
            <li> She says it makes her curls soft and not crunchy like most curly hair products.</li>
            <li> I do this 2 times a week (on rare occasions</li>
            <li> Plus I found Airwick Snuggle Fresh Linen wax melts for my scentsy warmers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to wear my hear naturally curly because it would be too frizzy, and not defined.</li>
            <li> , I have a long hair and my curls looked so natural and beautiful ..</li>
            <li> My curls are huge and soft so freaking bouncy !!!</li>
            <li> a great product for my hair...does not leave it stiff..</li>
            <li> This product smells nice and went on easy, but weighed down my curls</li>
            <li> I also have the Quick Curl Cream and this does bigger, rounder curls where as the Quick Curl Cream makes tighter, more spiral type curls</li>
            <li> I use about two squirts and my hair is pretty much covered and my curls really haven&#x27;t even looked better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a million hair products trying to get the right curl from my hair.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll just need to find the right combo.  </li>
            <li> right here will get me to mid-back length and achieve the softness I desire.</li>
            <li> It would probably work better on fine dry hair.</li>
            <li> It say&#x27;s on the label that your curls will be soft and full, and not look like Ramen noodles, and that it feels really light on the hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had long gorgeous hair my whole life.</li>
            <li> My new husband thinks it smells good - and could only smell it if he put his face in my hair.</li>
            <li> Helped to make my hair less &#x27;fro&#x27; and more FABULOUS!</li>
            <li> Great product for my usual frizzy curls.</li>
            <li> Yes it smells good, a little too good, but other than that</li>
            <li> I typically can get a good amount of curl with a lot of product</li>
            <li> I STAND behins this product from a person who struggles with not having time to blow out my hair everyday and wants to know my curls will look great anytime I use</li>
            <li> This product should not be called &amp;#34;Pillow Soft Curls.&amp;#34; I must admit that I love the smell of this product, it really smells like liquid fabric softener.  </li>
            <li> Smells great, not enough hold, and leaves my hair a big frizzy POOF.</li>
            <li> This product is more of a liquid than I expected but it works better that way because it looks natural!!</li>
            <li> The smell can be a bit overwhelming at first though, so if you&#x27;re sensitive to scents I would just suggest not using too much of the product in one sitting.</li>
            <li> I have smooth, soft curls with definition!</li>
            <li> Nice loose definition with no crunch.</li>
            <li> I have natural fine 3a/4a hair</li>
            <li> I have fine wavy hair and have been looking for something that makes my hair soft while brining out my curls in frizzy miami.  </li>
            <li> So if you have fine, naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> Fresh scent (may be strong for some), light weight, and minimal build up.  </li>
            <li> I was pretty surprised to learn that it wasn&#x27;t intended for my hair type in the first place, because it really gives me a better texture than anything else I have tried in my last 13 years of trying to fix curly hair &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> makes your hair super super soft and relaxed curls.  </li>
            <li> I like Miss Jessie&#x27;s Transitioner&#x27;s Magic a little bit better just because i have straight parts in my hair.  </li>
            <li> It is not unpleasant, and definitely not that strong.  </li>
            <li> Ths is a little too light for my very fine curly wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I do wish is wasn&#x27;t so expensive, but it is a great product!</li>
            <li> Really enjoy Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it really keeps my curls under control!</li>
            <li> Soft, smooth, waves...</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li> I have never worn my hair curly because I could never find a product that would keep my curls soft and not crunchy, as well as frizz free.  </li>
            <li> I have 3c curls up top and 4a corkscrew curls in the back.  </li>
            <li> Husband wants me to buy it by the case!</li>
            <li> On my next attempt I used more product, ~half-dollar amount, which I scrunched in, then towel-scrunched to absorb excess, then diffused.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got WAY too much fragrance in it!</li>
            <li> The funny thing is, the results get better after the second day - when you re-scrunch the hair with dampened fingertips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Caucasian female who&#x27;s battled frizzy, unmanageable hair for most of my life.</li>
            <li> even after being outside most of the day.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I wanted and was the size that was advertised.</li>
            <li> but my hair no longer smells like Downy ;)</li>
            <li> I have super fine, 2C/3A white girl hair.  </li>
            <li> its a lot of product and has a aroma that may put you off at first.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s funny</li>
            <li> so I would suggest a sample first (the website will send you some).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, we enjoy the styling benefits of Pillow Soft Curls and would purchase it again if Miss Jessie&#x27;s changed its fragrance.</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny, voluminous, curly, and overall lovely.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my hair relatively frizz-free and mostly defined</li>
            <li> I find that it doesn&#x27;t last more than a couple minutes however</li>
            <li> so I will probably keep looking for a similar more affordable option.  </li>
            <li> He says it smells better than a lot of the regular products I use.  </li>
            <li> Please note that I was pineappling my hair at night, and I exercised three times (intense cardio!).  </li>
            <li> First off, I am just now realizing this is a product designed for African-American hair.</li>
            <li> My curls don&#x27;t look as cute as they do when i do flattwists or just regular twist.</li>
            <li> For the first time in fifteen years, I&#x27;m not hiding it in a ponytail by the end of</li>
            <li> I love the way this product makes my hair look and feel, however, there is definitely a flake factor (as others have mentioned).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be assuaged by the price as I first was.</li>
            <li> I am a black man and very stylish.</li>
            <li> I next tried Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls and love it!  </li>
            <li> It smells like a very sweet fabric softener, and the scent is heavy enough that people around my daughter comment on how her hair smells when she uses it -- and not in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I opt for a ton of flat ironing most of the time instead.</li>
            <li> i bought this and used it for several nights and my hair is soft, smooth and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li> To be quite honest, I&#x27;ve used some of the cheaper products on the market that are not necessarily made for natural hair but are moisturizing, and they worked just as well.</li>
            <li> This is the first cream I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t look scrunchy or and it maeks my entire hair less frizzy so my baby hairs stay smooth and the top of the hair becomes smooth while the bottom is curly and has volume.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to puff out when dry, but when it is wet it has beautiful wringlets.</li>
            <li> I recieved my first tube of Super Soft curls as a gift.</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant and long lasting as well.</li>
            <li> BUT im almost positive</li>
            <li> I read a positive review from a bi-racial reviewer on this product and decided to try.  </li>
            <li> I am an African American with relatively soft hair and this stuff works great on my hair.</li>
            <li> I unfortunately do not use as much as I need because I can&#x27;t tolerate smelling the perfume all day.</li>
            <li> I used way too much the first time and my hair was grease-ball city.  </li>
            <li> They would be full and soft but this time i dont know if its</li>
            <li> My hair just seemed kind of weighed down, which is probably what increased that drying time.  </li>
            <li> My curls are super curly and soft.</li>
            <li> I let it dry and magically my curls bounced into beauty and when I squeeze my hair</li>
            <li> I would constantly wear my hair up before this product, but now it looks pretty fabulous letting it do its thing</li>
            <li> If you haven’t tried it I strongly recommend you do, especially that it’s sulphate/petroleum…</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy this again and again, and I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because the smell is so strong.</li>
            <li> They could still benefit by making the scent a little more mild.</li>
            <li> course, everyone is different but this is the best product I&#x27;ve used so far, and my curls are usually out of control.  </li>
            <li> Works great for my thick curly hair!  </li>
            <li> have natural curl/waves that tend to disappear the moment it gets warm or dry.</li>
            <li> This lotion provides just enough hold for my fine, curly hair without crunch, shrinkage and flaking.</li>
            <li> The cost of the product (like most Miss Jessie&#x27;s products) is pretty steep, but the quality of the product is unlink any other that I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has such a crisp and clean scent that I often find myself pulling my hair close to my nose to breath it in.</li>
            <li> I shampooed my hair and applied a small amount, because some of the reviews said it smelled really strong if you used too much (I cannot tolerate really strong fragrances).</li>
            <li> Love this product, yes the fragrance is STRONG, the first day thought I would never use again, so next day I used less</li>
            <li> Not even close, it&#x27;s the real winner</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this, but it just did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like having to fuss with my hair a lot either, though.</li>
            <li> If you use too much, yes the smell can be over powering.</li>
            <li> but I was really bummed because it made my head itch uncontrollably.</li>
            <li> use it on the weekends when I don&#x27;t really care what my hair looks like.</li>
            <li> It was way too much and my hair looked greasy.</li>
            <li> I find the price to be too much for what you are getting too.</li>
            <li> My friend had recommended this product and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> It works really well to define curls and elimate frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> It can leave you hair with the stiffer feeling depending on home much you use.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t wash my hair very often.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it does much for frizz</li>
            <li> I have searched everywhere for a product that would work on my hair; I have combo curly/wavy hair, and it&#x27;s very frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> and they would become straight.</li>
            <li> it works very well, however the smell of it gives me headaches.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t smell it much.  </li>
            <li> Hair is soft and looks neat, not crazy.</li>
            <li> but i was expecting a miracle to increase my curl volume from straightning it so much</li>
            <li> As the years went by, I started really hating the crunchy feeling</li>
            <li> Yes, it really does smell like Snuggle fabric softner, but I wasn&#x27;t too bothered by it.</li>
            <li> I also think it works better on wet hair rather than damp hair like the bottle suggest.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t really get that.</li>
            <li> : don&#x27;t use a whole lot.</li>
            <li> All I really use is about a dime/nickel sized amount</li>
            <li> I find that after using it a couple of times, I don&#x27;t mind it so much</li>
            <li> It keeps frizz away and keep my hair from tangling so much</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
            <li> Here is the real scoop on it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My curls are bouncy and soft and I rarely get frizz now.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> The product is also very high-priced</li>
            <li> MANAGEBLE HAIR NOT HARD,CURLY WAVY OR STRAIGHT</li>
            <li> and she really loves it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely horrified.</li>
            <li> I will be sticking with my much cheaper Suave from now on.</li>
            <li> Not at all what it claims to do waist of too much money</li>
            <li> But I really wanted to use the PSC because of the fragrance.</li>
            <li> As someone who has dealt with her stubborn, curly hair her whole life, this product is the real deal.</li>
            <li> It gives you soft nice curls without frizz and without that wet crunchy look that gel &amp; mousse can give.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Basically, the PROS:helps achieve a nice curl; provides &amp;#34;just okay&amp;#34; softening (when compared to StaSofFro); will let you re-style for a few days before washing.</li>
            <li> Not only did this product do nothing for my naturally curly hair, but the smell was overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> I thinned it with some rose water, which is allowing me to use it up rather than have it go to waste.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;re big fans of Miss Jessie&#x27;s at our house, and love 99.9% of their products, but we won&#x27;t be buying Pillow Soft Curls again unless they change its fragrance.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair kind of heavy and sticky.</li>
            <li> The only hair product I&#x27;ve found that makes my curls soft, defined, and cute without frizz.</li>
            <li> I live in the hot, humid, sticky South</li>
            <li> I have been pretty dedicated to the Deva line, but I wanted to try something new.  </li>
            <li> Pillow soft hait is right.</li>
            <li> Smell wasnt as bad as most ppl made it sound, product went in and spread very easily.</li>
            <li> This product did cause major shrinkage but it was expected, put my hair in a puneapple at night to kind of strech it.  </li>
            <li> I am pretty sure this is something like Downey mixed with pomade because it looks, feels and definitely SMELLS like fabric softener.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s worth the investment!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than any other curl product I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hear the uniquitous crackling you normally get with hair products for curls!  </li>
            <li> I bought this at a local retailer and was really excited to try it because it is aimed at producing looser, softer curls</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would love to try samples of their other products</li>
            <li> I have super fine hair and this product was too heavy</li>
            <li> ( I can&#x27;t wash my hair everyday or it&#x27;ll dry out ) and smelled great the whole time.</li>
            <li> I have latin hair and most everyday curl, de-frizz products aren&#x27;t strong enough to manage the hair.  </li>
            <li> Very off putting smell, did not live up to it&#x27;s claims, more sticky then soft.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty thin but has nice curl to it if I use the right product and finally have found the right product!</li>
            <li> I really had high hopes for this curl cream.  </li>
            <li> first then I add the pillow soft lotion</li>
            <li> So all in all, my first attempt rates as an epic fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I probably use about a quarter sized amount total for my full head of hair.</li>
            <li> But, what I really want is smooth, loose waves that aren&#x27;t crunchy/ soaked in product or frizzy and of control.</li>
            <li> If you have very fine hair that gets limp and at times stringy, go for a gel instead.</li>
            <li> My hair is in a transition phase of a faded keratin treatment and new, very curly hair coming in.</li>
            <li> They are less on the ramen-noodle side and more on the corkscrew side.</li>
            <li> I have a suave product that is half the price and works much better.</li>
            <li> I seriously never review products.</li>
            <li> Luckily the smell only lasts a day</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t have the same result as Miss Jessie&#x27;s Quick Curls.  </li>
            <li> Mainly focus on putting it on the ends.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times now, but I think this is as good as my curls are going to get.  </li>
            <li> so they look decent.</li>
            <li> then I&#x27;m super frizzy with 3 different textures on my head.  </li>
            <li> I am glad to finally have found something that actually works.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only do I smell amazing all day long, my curly hair is soft and luscious.</li>
            <li> Usually i let my hair air dry to keep curls defined but even with a diffuser it worked great.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Still, this gets high ratings from me.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s high praise in man-words.</li>
            <li> so I recommend a quick wash in the morning before you re-apply the product and be sure to do a thorough wash each week (for those of us with natural hair who tend to wash less frequently as to not dry out the scalp and hair).</li>
            <li> the sleep-on-it result a little better.</li>
            <li> The cute curls are not worth the slimy feeling!</li>
            <li> It tames my curls and makes them so soft!!  </li>
            <li> I have extremely fine hair, but my curls make it appear thick and full.</li>
            <li> Initially I was a little put off by the comparison to fabric softener, but in practice I find the scent to be fresh and not at all overwhelming.</li>
            <li> However, by the middle of the day they were looking a little rough and this product makes my hair feel incredibly greasy.</li>
            <li> My main concern/goal whenever I&#x27;m looking for a new product is curl definition without that crunchy result.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to respond to this comment if you need advice, but I am telling you this is a great product and you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This really does give soft curls.  </li>
            <li> It does give me more defined curls, and after its dried I run my fingers through it to loosen up the crunchiness.</li>
            <li> I normally bought at Target</li>
            <li> made my hair feel icky smelled nice though</li>
            <li> Straightening my hair took longer than normal.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it did weigh my type 3a hair down and did not define my curls, took away from my hair&#x27;s natural volume, but this may be a great product for denser curls to ease them more.</li>
            <li> I love that is doesn&#x27;t make your hair crunchy, but the smell is so odd!</li>
            <li> NO HARD</li>
            <li> do think that this is worth a try, just because some of the poor results I experienced may be due to my hair type (between 4a &amp;4b).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any stronger than any other hair product, and it smells REALLY good and &amp;#34;clean.&amp;#34; I definitely recommend this product if your hair is similar to mine.</li>
            <li> I have 2c-3a colored, right above the shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> I took it right back and returned it.</li>
            <li> And now I am back to trying to find just the right product all over again.  </li>
            <li> Got this as a gift and it left a film on my hair and just didnt feel right, so i washed out immediately</li>
            <li> I find that this product only really works to its full potential only when freshly washing conditioning your hair.  </li>
            <li> It transfers to my skin and hands easily during the day (yuck) and runs down my face when working out.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> it created an entirely new look for me</li>
            <li> My problem is, I need to stop trying new products and stick with what works.</li>
            <li> My new fav product.</li>
            <li> This product defines my curls and weighs down the flyaways enough that my hair actually looks good.</li>
            <li> Not stiff at all!</li>
            <li> I put this in right after my shower while my hair is still wet and either sleep on it or just let it air dry and both work great, although I usually like</li>
            <li> My curls were hideous and my hair felt very gunky yet very puffy and big.</li>
            <li> This product creates soft non-frizzy curls and you don&#x27;t even need to use a lot; in fact you don&#x27;t want to use a lot because I learned early on that using too much makes your hair a bit sticky.</li>
            <li> Indeed, very soft curls.</li>
            <li> They look so natural and feel so soft!!</li>
            <li> The smell is really strong and not worth any &amp;#34;pillow soft curls&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s what Jessie&#x27;s pillow soft curls gave me!</li>
            <li> This is one I’m sticking to as far as I can see!</li>
            <li> My curls are defined but soft!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve EVER had 2nd day curls.</li>
            <li> Finally this is one that does exactly what it says it will.</li>
            <li> You definitely don&#x27;t need much!</li>
            <li> Soft curls without having to use a ton of product!</li>
            <li> Bought my first and only bottle at Walgreens (also sold at Target).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had such pretty, well defined curls until this product.  </li>
            <li> It does hold the curl, but it feels &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; (hair doesn&#x27;t feel clean, can&#x27;t do anything with it the next day when I want to put it up b/c it feels gross).</li>
            <li> I can usually get my hair to be a strong 2B or a possible 2C curl if I use the right product.</li>
            <li> apply about two peas worth, work through the hair, scrunch a bit, and allow to air dry.</li>
            <li> I usually use Kinky-Curly products but became intrigued about what Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls claimed to be able to do.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still working on figuring out exactly how much and how wet the hair needs to be for optimal results.</li>
            <li> I got Pillow Soft Curls from my local Target and used it for the first time today.</li>
            <li> I had to pull my hair back (after checking with a coworker to make sure other people couldn&#x27;t smell it!).  </li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ll notice minimal curls form in my hair after first application, the curls/waves quickly fall flat, leaving a disheveled appearance in my hair.</li>
            <li> The only positive thing I can say about this product is</li>
            <li> It is better for use on wet hair than dry.</li>
            <li> AND I don&#x27;t have to use half the bottle on my lower back lengthed hair like most products.  </li>
            <li> so when I use product, I usually run out pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> It did keep my hair very soft and was not the least bit crunchy, but it is probably much better for tighter curls or thicker hair types.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit high priced for what it does, which doesn&#x27;t really seem like much to me, I still have to add in other hair product to get my hair to not look frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I barely crunched as I put it on and had decently curly hair.</li>
            <li> Doing so will probably cut back on the scent (if it&#x27;s too strong for some people), decrease the build-up and overall make it last longer to justify the price.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way in damp hair, and curls can be quickly refreshed with a quick spritz of water.</li>
            <li> Have not been able to have medium length hair FOR YEARS because it turns to frizz, and I have tried gazillions of non-frizz and other products, most of them expensive and high end.</li>
            <li> You can even refresh the curls the next day with a little water and a tad more product.</li>
            <li> Clearly smells like a bottled of downy fabric softener.</li>
            <li> Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls is the product I&#x27;ve been searching for, and believe me, I&#x27;ve been on a twenty-year hair product search.</li>
            <li> The liquid from Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls was all over the book.  </li>
            <li> It does what it promises, makes my curls soft and defined.  </li>
            <li> My daughter and I both have naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> This gave me well defined soft curls for my wavy/curly hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Thought I would try Jelly Soft Curls brand because it was cheaper ($14)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not as offended by the smell as some, and I&#x27;m sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li> the last perm i got really fried my hair</li>
            <li> when i wash my hair it feels so soft and conditioned.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my curls soft and popping.</li>
            <li> No build up with this product and my hair is soft and curly.</li>
            <li> I use about two nickel size dollops and gently rake my hands through my hair (very gently to not totally separate the curls), then I used a tiny dollop of Aveda&#x27;s Be Curly, and gently scrunched.</li>
            <li> It also feels like I have something completely coating my hair.</li>
            <li> I applied Cantu Shea Butter Leave In Conditioning Cream, then Trader Joe&#x27;s jojoba oil, then a dime-sized amount of Pillow Soft Curls.</li>
            <li> Today is the 2nd day and my curls are still defined (I pull my hair straight up into an old pair of stockings to sleep in), they are moisturized, and soft (any crunchiness is gone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have decided to try and grow my hair out which means curly, heat free hair for a few months.  </li>
            <li> Stayed soft all day</li>
            <li> Soft curls with no build up and no greasiness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to smell do not buy, every time I turn my head</li>
            <li> My curls are soft, shiny, and bouncy.</li>
            <li> but when you run your fingers through the curls they get soft and not frizzy</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s not heavy like gel</li>
            <li> It keeps my daughters hair really soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and wild, and I have struggled for years and years trying to find a product that gives me the look I want.</li>
            <li> The lotion leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> There is no built up on my hair and my hair is pillow soft just as adveristed.</li>
            <li> So, yes, it does help &amp;#34;encourage&amp;#34; (their claim) the curls, and it does make the hair feel soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried around 50 products of ALL price ranges and this one takes the cake by far.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> Nothing works like Pillow Soft curls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen my curls so frizz-free, silky soft, and bouncy.</li>
            <li> I was completely amazed.</li>
            <li> There are many comments here about the scent, but I use it sparingly and it doesn&#x27;t bother me in the least.</li>
            <li> As a person with naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my hair so soft that I even use it when I&#x27;m going to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> Just like it says, they will be soft curls.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m liking this product a lot so far.  </li>
            <li> But this stuff kept my curls in place, soft, and non frizzy all day...</li>
            <li> I ordered the product because I wanted to add some body and strength to my natural kinky hair.</li>
            <li> I tried Pillow Soft Curls by Miss Jessie&#x27;s because it helps preserve the soft curls that I have when I exit the shower.</li>
            <li> I just wanted my hair to feel soft to the touch but still curly.</li>
            <li> i have sensitive skin and the &#x27;laundry detergent&amp;#34; in it made my face break out (where my hair would touch my face)&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;i would buy it again IF i didnt have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls this week from Target.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that this product would provide soft control and definition for my curls/waves.  </li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to fragrance, do not buy this.</li>
            <li> I have caucasian hair with natural wave.</li>
            <li> It definitely smells like laundry detergent, but I really like the smell (as does my husband).</li>
            <li> Since going natural, I have made this product one of my regulars.  </li>
            <li> my curls still be soft and playable) than crunchy hair.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair soft and defined my curls just like it said.  </li>
            <li> Soft, silky, 2b waves.  </li>
            <li> This help me to wash and go with soft hair instead of crunch an crust.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the comments on the smell -- someone nailed it and said it smells like fabric softener</li>
            <li> enter Pillow Soft Curls.  </li>
            <li> This product gives you what it states &amp;#34;pillow, soft curls&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I am 40 years old and have been using &amp;#34;Curly Perm&amp;#34; Activator Lotion since I was 15 years old.  </li>
            <li> I ha e naturally curly hair that I wet-set for manageability.</li>
            <li> I used it once with my hair drying naturally</li>
            <li> The Pillow Soft curls does just that - soft curls.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I do have Pillow Soft Curls.</li>
            <li> This made my curls so soft.  </li>
            <li> This makes it really soft and not greasy</li>
            <li> This product made my hair so soft.  </li>
            <li> It reminds me of an old lady going to church.</li>
            <li> My DH doesn&#x27;t like it either - so much so that he&#x27;s commented on it several times.</li>
            <li> I can mist my hair with water and apply this and my curls are defined and soft</li>
            <li> As far as the smell, it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> Natural hair.  </li>
            <li> I had ordered the Miss Jesse&#x27;s pillow soft curls but it just sat in my drawer because I had already decided to give the wash and go&#x27;s a rest.</li>
            <li> It has caused me to wash my hair more frequently that I probably should, which with thick curly hair, you know can be an issue as well.</li>
            <li> The smell is very strong and not pleasant.  </li>
            <li> it seems a little heavy if you use too much and the scent is VERY STRONG of laundry soap/softener.</li>
            <li> I blow dry with a round brush and my hair is soft and frizz free and has nice big round curls where I put them.  </li>
            <li> Maybe if you have super dry hair this will work for you, but my normal to dry hair does not like it one bit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Beware that if you have fine hair, the ingredients in this product might possibly weigh it down.</li>
            <li> It left my fine 2B/2C hair weighed down and</li>
            <li> and I still have half a bottle left which means this product has lasted much longer than others (and is therefore worth the price to me) and my curls are soft, not crunchy.</li>
            <li> I have found the most success using this on very wet hair, a little goes a long way and when I don&#x27;t diffuse.  </li>
            <li> I have searched high and low for something that does what miss Jessie&#x27;s does.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much of a natural curl right now, because I&#x27;ve recently had my hair relaxed, but if I but a dab of this on my hair with curlers and let it dry,</li>
            <li> #34;shellac&amp;#34; setting when my hair dried; however, when I used it on dry hair, I had better results.</li>
            <li> What I usually do is shower, brush out my hair, coil it into a bun and secure it in place.  </li>
            <li> It also has a different scent from normal hair products which I like a lot.</li>
            <li> it will be back to normal.</li>
            <li> I let my hair air-dry and it ended up a little crunchy, but some quick scrunching took care of that.</li>
            <li> so I rarely wear my hair down anymore.</li>
            <li> Trying to get me a new regimen going on, and this is definitely included as part of my calming detangling sessions.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought the product was nice due to not leaving my hair &#x27;crunchy&#x27; to bad the body didn&#x27;t stay for more than 20 minutes and regular products keep my hair curly all day long.</li>
            <li> After purchasing a new product every time I ran out of the old one, I finally purchased a second Pillow Soft Curls.</li>
            <li> This product does a great job of giving my curls definition, cutting back on the frizz, without leaving any crunch.  </li>
            <li> I combed a very generous amount of this through my damp hair and proceeded to tousle and blow dry my hair with a diffuser.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice it once my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> This company makes multiple products but for Caucasian hair that is very curly I couldn&#x27;t recommend this product enough.</li>
            <li> I have small waves which get very frizzy because of hair dyes and hot tools.</li>
            <li> I also had a bit of build-up from it the next day, but I didn&#x27;t mind that so much because I just re-wetted my hair a bit and used up whatever product was left in my hair from the day before.  </li>
            <li> I let my hair air-dry as much as possible and only use a blowdryer/diffuser if really pressed for time.  </li>
            <li> I have type 3 curly thick blonde hair and bought this to see if I could get a bit more volume with a lighter cream product.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t loved all of Miss Jessie&#x27;s products; some are too thick or heavy, even for my 3B hair.</li>
            <li> It does not weigh my hair down, but leaves it bouncy and with just the right amount of definition.  </li>
            <li> This product definitely makes hair very soft, and does not make it crunchy.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> that actually makes my curly hair look and feel pillow soft!</li>
            <li> I get major shrinkage when i wash my hair and it stays like that for about 3 days b4</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product does have a strong smell that&#x27;s similar to fabric softener, but it&#x27;s not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I use as directed, starting with freshly washed hair that I only squeezed dry (towels create frizz).</li>
            <li> I thought maybe the smell would dissipate as my hair dried, but several hours later it was still so strong</li>
            <li> My curls are a &amp;#34;tybe b&amp;#34; and can be very dry and very frizzy.</li>
            <li> Makes my grand daughters curls soft and fluffy, rather than tightly cured.  </li>
            <li> I have a huge complaint with the shipping department at amazon.  </li>
            <li> it brought my natural curls back to life!</li>
            <li> I washed and deep conditioned my hair, then applied the Pillow Soft Curls.</li>
            <li> Until now, defined and soft had only been an oxymoron for my curls.</li>
            <li> and they are such soft curls</li>
            <li> I used to use a leave-in spray conditioner that left my hair curly yet soft, but can&#x27;t find it any longer.  </li>
            <li> and it was the same thing - soft curls.  </li>
            <li> It defined my naturally curly hair and manages the frizz at the same time!!!</li>
            <li> My curls were shiny, soft and defined, with a tiny, but acceptable amount of frizz.  </li>
            <li> I am white, 67 years old with dyed (red) naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> They were soft once dried however on that first day.</li>
            <li> ; when I tried to straighten my hair after almost 3 weeks of curls and continued use of this product, my hair was waaay more difficult than normal.</li>
            <li> A full bottle lasts me about 3 months - I am caucasion and have curly hair about 2 inches past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I was using Miss Jessie&#x27;s Quick Curls but found that it left my curly hair a little crunchier than I would like.  </li>
            <li> I can generally go about 3 days in between washes, but with this product I find myself having to wash every 2 days, or use a whole lot of dry shampoo on day 3 and pull it back.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of getting stuck with these natural hair products that don&#x27;t work, or their fragrances are overwhelmingly strong.  </li>
            <li> The curls are soft not hard like other products.</li>
            <li> very soft, bouncy curls and my hair is about 3 inches long.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to explain the consistency of the product, it is not gel or mousse, it is more of a mixture of a runny lotion, it does not make your hands sticky and you only need about a table spoon for long hair.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money, and pretty much not worth it at all.</li>
            <li> - maybe I&#x27;m not using as much of the product as other folks.  </li>
            <li> Other than the fast shipping this product lives up to its name.</li>
            <li> And many african american hair products are very heavy and make my hair loose its bounce and movement.  </li>
            <li> All I do to revive my whole look is to dampen my hair, put a little leave in conditioner, and finally pillow soft, run my fingers thru my hair, and I&#x27;m off.  </li>
            <li> It produces a defined curl that is still soft, not stiff or &amp;#34;crunchy.&amp;#34; And don&#x27;t let the high pricetag fool you- a little bit of this stuff goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, however, for as long as I can remember</li>
            <li> i have long naturally wavy hair</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> I owned this product for a while, and my first take was that it was too heavy.</li>
            <li> I have tried probably a hundred different products, both expensive as well as inexpensive and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> It comes in a decent sized bottle and since you only need a minimal amount it lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long, curly, and more than anything, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> Leaves curls soft and holds the curl for a very long time....</li>
            <li> If u have long natural hair with tiny curls this may work as</li>
            <li> I also have SUPER thick strands and LOTS of them</li>
            <li> I have long, fine naturally curly hair that if I put too much stuff in, it looks stringy and crazy but if I don&#x27;t put anything</li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse hair that rarely gets greasy, but this stuff took it to a new level.  </li>
            <li> Just curls that are loose and soft.</li>
            <li> I sectioned my hair and applied a leave in conditioner (Giovanni) and then a little less than a dime sized amount of the Pillow Soft- all in all, about three dimes worth to my head.</li>
            <li> and if I take the time to dry it I can create big soft curls with no stiffness.  </li>
            <li> sister has fine thin hair and she loves it</li>
            <li> recommend it to anyone who has thick, frizzy, curly hair who wants curls that are big, soft, and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product!</li>
            <li> With this, I was only able to achieve 2A hair, very weak waves.</li>
            <li> But since I only wash my hair 2-3 times a week, I&#x27;m willing to live with it those few days and not deduct any stars (I would take off a half star if I could).</li>
            <li> If I get another sample, or a smaller tube of it, I will definitely dilute it with a little water, or, I just won&#x27;t use as much of it.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I had given up on my dry naturally curly hair because I was tired of wasting money with the same results of dry and stiff curls.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s also a little too heavy to use every single day on my hair (a ton of long, very fine hair with loose curls)...</li>
            <li> Sets quickly, not too hard, washes out easily.</li>
            <li> If I can find the other Miss Jessie products in a trial/sample-size, I will try them, but I won&#x27;t be paying the full-price for the Pillow Soft Curls.</li>
            <li> i thought the other reviews were just from sensitive PEOPLE....</li>
            <li> But it is a little high priced though.  </li>
            <li> All I do is apply it when I get out of the shower, and then once it dries I use a little bit of bed heads after party because sometimes it&#x27;s too volumized and I need it to calm down.</li>
            <li> My curls are small coil like a spring in a pen, this particular product suggested that it would give you big curls instead of the ramen noodle tiny curls.</li>
            <li> Meanwhile, my curls were a wild, frizzy mess that could only be tamed by tons of gel, mousse, hair lotion, and hairspray -</li>
            <li> I put a tiny bit in my palms (about nickel size) and work it into my damp long hair.</li>
            <li> I have waist long waves that tend to frizz up all over especially at the crown.</li>
            <li> and it last a long time</li>
            <li> then don&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been blow drying and sometimes flat</li>
            <li> At long last, my search is over!  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not a very active or outdoorsy person) and with this product I have touchable soft curls and very little</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t describe exactly what I mean</li>
            <li> My hair is very wild and frizzy curly and this product allows me to wear my hair down without Barrett&#x27;s or hair ties!</li>
            <li> Without product my hair is very flat, frizzy and droopy.</li>
            <li> I have very long (mid-back) fairly coarse hair; the type would be 2C/3A depending on its length.  </li>
            <li> Unlike women who mostly use the product, I am a biracial man (half black father and half black mother) with</li>
            <li> and my hair was completely dry the next day at work.  </li>
            <li> I let it air dry and boom, big bouncy curls that expanded over night and were shirly temple like in the morning.</li>
            <li> and hopefully next l want to blow dry my hair</li>
            <li> The next day, the curls were dried out completely.</li>
            <li> Pillow Soft Curls gave them enough definition that I didn&#x27;t feel the need to break out the curling wand to touch up those limp</li>
            <li> I have fluffy, big, curls that are soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Kind of a sad waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick, kinda dry, frizzy kinky hair.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit stronger than other products but at the same time it smells like baby lotion and not only do I get compliments on how curly my hair looks</li>
            <li> but I alternate it every other day with a different frizz tamer, and the combo seems to be working.</li>
            <li> I let it air dry about 75% of the way, then used the blow dryer/diffuser combo to dry the last 25%.  </li>
            <li> For me, with the Pillow Soft Curls, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Too bad, since I liked the way my hair looked.</li>
            <li> So I was pretty skeptical about trying Pillow Soft Curls...</li>
            <li> I only put it on a small section of my hair and it was soft and did produce curls</li>
            <li> This cream reduces the frizz and makes the waves fluffy soft.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way, be careful about not applying too much of it on hair.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> A lot of reviewers seem to not really like the smell, but I actually like it!</li>
            <li> - keeps my hair in curls all day long.</li>
            <li> I am not natural and I do not have curly hair......</li>
            <li> The curls were long but bouncy and curly.</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really noticed anything different about my curls with this product.</li>
            <li> I probably would not buy it again but it lasts a long time on the shelf.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really long, so</li>
            <li> My hair was not soft at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , that will leave my hair soft and fluffy like a body wave when it dries, without a hold, without a residue/build up and without my hair feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> and my hair comes out fluffy with soft curls.</li>
            <li> As a caucasian woman with naturally curly hair, after 40 years I finally got tired of fighting my natural texture and decided to work with it.  </li>
            <li> It gives me thick, lustrous curling tendril and so much hair confidence</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t put too much on (about the size of a quarter, and maybe 1/4 inch thick, or the size of a nickel</li>
            <li> I have generally unmanageable hair and needed something to help define my curl without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> Next try, I used a dime-size amount of Pillow Soft with a dime-size amount of AG Recoil (which I was previously using, but it gave the wet look), scrunched into wet hair, towel-scrunched, diffused, et voila</li>
            <li> BUT the biggest negative is that it seems like it takes much, much longer for my hair to air dry with this product in it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Caucasian with type 3b curly hair and every other cream seems to weigh down my hair too much, especially at the roots since my hair is mid back.</li>
            <li> It takes a little trial and error to figure out just how much you need for your hair type, but after that it works well, but seems a little pricey.</li>
            <li> Well not true, my tiny curls stayed tiny.</li>
            <li> I purchased Pillow Soft Curls almost 2 months ago and at first I was disappointed because the price was so high for something that didn&#x27;t seem to work when air drying (which is what the directions recommend.)</li>
            <li> Closer to wash day, I&#x27;ve been wetting my hair a little around the edges, smearing the Pillow Soft Curls in my hands, rubbing this, then ecostyler gel, brushing into a bun, tying my hair down for the night and the next day, shiny, laid edges and hair with waves.</li>
            <li> only downside (other than the cost) is that the product often needs reapplication EVERY DAY which can lead to product</li>
            <li> I have long thick, coarse, damaged naturally curly hair and I was losing my curls to these unmanagable frizzes.</li>
            <li> Part of the change is due to my finally accepting all these wavy curls.</li>
            <li> This might be due to my application technique (I was rushed), so we&#x27;ll see how it goes next time.  </li>
            <li> So, I would definitely recommend this to 3A curly&#x27;s, but I can&#x27;t say anything for the other hair types.</li>
            <li> about 1/2 thick.)I have tried other Miss Jessie products after discovering this, but this is the only that works for me, and does it ever.</li>
            <li> But I was hoping for long, loose curls</li>
            <li> My hair is dry (color-treated) and medium weight.</li>
            <li> and i couldn&#x27;t blow dry it without frizz.  </li>
            <li> it looks gunky and dry.</li>
            <li> I think it has even helped with some of my damaged hair to not be so dry.</li>
            <li> I let it air dry</li>
            <li> Garnier Fructis Sleek and Shine shampoo, conditioner, and leave - in conditioner for Frizzy, Dry, Unmanageable Hair, or Herbal Essences</li>
            <li> I use it after unpinning my curls, when my hair is dry.  </li>
            <li> It did not leave my hair like i wanted it my hair was frizzy and felt a bit dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Directions say to put on damp hair and defuse or air dry.  </li>
            <li> so i rinse, put this in my hair and let it air dry</li>
            <li> I have color-treated wavy hair, and it seems to be always dry [&#x3D; frizzy].</li>
            <li> My hair is touchable &amp; smells like a dry sheet.</li>
            <li> You can go curly or blow dry</li>
            <li> My hair looked decent for about 30 minutes before it completely dried, then become a frizzy mess.  </li>
            <li> My curls are so soft and fluffy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wasted a sickening amount of money on products that made great promises but always fell short.</li>
            <li> It also made my hair very dry so now when I try to blow dry my hair</li>
            <li> Works well loose curls.  </li>
            <li> When it came back in it came back with very tight curls and even after a year it is still curly.</li>
            <li> If I double that amount my hair will be weighted down.</li>
            <li> I made sure to shampoo and condition and wash as thoroughly as possible but it still left a weird residue behind.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my go-to styling product for when I air dry my hair!</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is that her hair gets frizzy half way thru the day unless I use a palmade with it some leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> When my hair is almost dry, I fluff the curls with my hands to add some body.</li>
            <li> I only use about a tablespoon and a half</li>
            <li> , REGULAR BLACK HAIR  </li>
            <li> I tried twice while my air was wet one day and another while it as dry.  </li>
            <li> : super frizzy hair or weird product-coated hair.  </li>
            <li> I can even go to sleep with damp hair in a crazy bun on top of my head, and with this cream when I wake up in the morning and take my hair down</li>
            <li> Not NEARLY as knotty as with other products though so</li>
            <li> I brushed out my hair, flipped it upside down, and rubbed the cream in my hands and scrunched my hair like I would any other gel or cream.  </li>
            <li> Yes, the curls were a little fluffier than when I use Kinky-Curly, but they were not big.</li>
            <li> Only need a little bit</li>
            <li> Smells like a laundry sheet, which isn&#x27;t so bad, but it&#x27;s SO potent</li>
            <li> The cream is lightweight, and only a small amount is needed for my long hair.</li>
            <li> I had absolutely no idea how to fix it</li>
            <li> I scrunch after my hair has air dried to release some of the extra lotion.</li>
            <li> its 22 dollars ugh, and im not really rolling in the dough,</li>
            <li> I scrunch it into my wet hair and then just pick it out with my fingers once it dries.</li>
            <li> I went into my bathroom at work, wet my hair with my spray bottle that I keep in my desk and put this product in sections on my hair</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter how careful I am to not overuse it.</li>
            <li> I separated my soaking wet hair into 8 sections.</li>
            <li> Apply to wet hair and it dries crunchy</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely not what it is marketed to be.  </li>
            <li> Second of all, it completely dried out my hair and made it WAY frizzier than it was to begin with.  </li>
            <li> However, they all give a wet look that leaves my hair crispy.</li>
            <li> I spent $22.00 for this at Target.</li>
            <li> It is expensive but it&#x27;s SO worth</li>
            <li> I have white girl wavy/curly hair and have been doing the curly girl thing for a few years.</li>
            <li> I REALLY DO NOT LIKE MS JESSIE PRODUCTS</li>
            <li> I used this stuff for the last few months.</li>
            <li> This did not really do much for my hair.</li>
            <li> then wet &amp; twist my hair tomorrow nite with curling pudding</li>
            <li> I have not used this on wet hair yet as recommended on label.</li>
            <li> Not Really what I expected 😏</li>
            <li> It does however help to curl up my naturally curly thick Caucasian hair without ramen noodle crunch.  </li>
            <li> like I do, try the pillow soft curls before you waste your money on the creams (they&#x27;re just way to heavy and greasy.)</li>
            <li> So I continued to use it and returned to my usual method of putting product in after the shower and braiding my hair into about 15 different braids to dry overnight.</li>
            <li> If I dry my hair without straightening it, it looks like a frizzy mess with no real curl pattern or definition.  </li>
            <li> This stuff gives me soft, defined, voluminous curls without weighing it down or making it hard and crunchy.</li>
            <li> I have loose curls and this product keeps down the frizz and defines the curls without making them crunchy.</li>
            <li> The products I&#x27;ve used in the past always leave me with the wet or crunchy hair look, or they don&#x27;t hold enough to manage the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product is a little thick, and the only complaint I have is that my hair isn&#x27;t very shiny when I use it.</li>
            <li> price; instructions poorly given, causing user to have to rinse out/comb out the hard coating when it dries; leaves behind a bit of residue for the first couple of days; and, finally, doesn&#x27;t quite live up to the hair-softening hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also, a little goes a long way with this product.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way as well.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it does nothing for shine, so I rub hair oil or spritz a shine spray once my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> I lost all of my hair due to chemotherapy treatments.</li>
            <li> From the cheap to the very expensive.</li>
            <li> Other hair lotions just give me shiny frizz, but this shapes my frizz into the shape my hair is trying to be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it would work on African-American hair, but because it works in my hair so well, I wonder if it might not offer enough control for coarser hair.</li>
            <li> I should have heeded the warning of other posters.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine what this would smell like if you were to wear any other scent.</li>
            <li> I knew I was not going to try it again, and it would just wind up in the box with some of the other items that didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> This product flakes alot, Ive never had this problem with any other product ive tried</li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t get crunchy like it does with other gels.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half black half white</li>
            <li> Also holds extremely well for curling hair.</li>
            <li> I decided to experiment with other products...</li>
            <li> My hair usually has some big curls anyway</li>
            <li> Which I didn&#x27;t even think about until I read other reviews...</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that would define and hydrate my 3b-ish curls, without the stickiness and crunchiness I get from other products.  </li>
            <li> Other reviewers said it smells like fabric softener.  </li>
            <li> NO TYPE BY NUMBER OTHER PRODUCTS DID NOT HOLD CURLS</li>
            <li> (I have that problem with a lot of other products).</li>
            <li> I have used Bumble and Bumble, Moroccan Oil and just about every other curl cream.</li>
            <li> Its hard to find a product that provides enough control for the new growth (very dry, frizzy, thick) without weighing down the less curly half.</li>
            <li> Now, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m just incapable of using the small amount of product other reviewers recommend, but so far every time I&#x27;ve tried it, my hair feels heavy and crunchy!</li>
            <li> I have very thick naturally curly hair, and in the summer time I just use this product and wash n go!  </li>
            <li> This is okay as far as setting my twists but the smell is absolutely horrible.</li>
            <li> My curls have NEVER been this defined and if there was definition with other products, they would be stiff and look dry.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t like the scent - it was too sweet and heavy although it wasn&#x27;t so bad by the second day.</li>
            <li> Other products either left my hair hard and sticky or it cracked when I tried to brush it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need any other product but Miss Jessie&#x27;s and look forward to trying your other products!</li>
            <li> When I attempt to blow dry it my hair is dry, waxy, sticky tangly and dull.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, and this product left a weird, dirty feeling in my hair and it weighed it down.  </li>
            <li> amazon even sells it for a bit less that other places.</li>
            <li> My mixed race child has a hard time with her hair getting frizzy after wearing it down all day.</li>
            <li> Not worth the time or money.  </li>
            <li> My initial review of this product was a bit negative.  </li>
            <li> I was chilling at her apartment, watching her get ready for us to go out</li>
            <li> I have thick, fairly coarse, curly not kinky hair.  </li>
            <li> I did a partial diffuse and air dried the rest of the way.  </li>
            <li> She wore it down three days in a row with this product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my hair weighed down</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and this helps keep my frizz down.  </li>
            <li> I probably would not purchase again unless the smell was toned down.</li>
            <li> My hair does not look greasy, weighed down or crunchy -</li>
            <li> This product weighed my hair down and made it feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> Helps define my curls without weighing then down or giving them that crunchy look and feel.</li>
            <li> does have a \\&quot;dryer sheet\\&quot; smell, but I feel like it dies down during the day.  </li>
            <li> Hands down.</li>
            <li> but it works wonders once you get it down.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not strong and my the time I add a little gel and blow dry my hair</li>
            <li> The reviewers were right, it smells just like fabric softner, and it made my hair feel tacky and dirty.</li>
            <li> It looked wet for about an hour and after that it was just plain curly.</li>
            <li> Pillow Soft Curls, when applied in generous amounts to very wet hair, results in soft, non-frizzy curls that don&#x27;t look like a bad perm.  </li>
            <li> I usually just let my hair air dry and do its thing, afterwards taming it with styling cream.</li>
            <li> no more frizz when i do blow dry</li>
            <li> If you feel like silicones typically weigh your hair down, this product may do just that.</li>
            <li> However, for me, this product takes a few other products to make it work.</li>
            <li> I presume I would just smell like clean clothing - which isn&#x27;t really a bad thing?</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;d have to do less work with a curling wand</li>
            <li> After brushing out and slightly towel-drying my hair, I flip my head over and apply about a grape-sized amount to my hair.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for people with a softer, less course curl.</li>
            <li> I moved to North Carolina about a year and a half ago and immediately started having problems with frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> As I Am Coconut Co-wash), conditioned (Carol&#x27;s Daughter Black Vanilla), applied a leave-in (As I Am) and then applied the Miss Jessie&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> If it is overwelming to some, you may want to consider using less of the product.</li>
            <li> And about $10 less than the others.</li>
            <li> it turns out my hair is CURLY, not just a frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> I have thick, long hair to my belly button</li>
            <li> flat hair on top, curly on the bottom; tight, crunchy curls; and the worst, tight crunchy curls on parts of my head,</li>
            <li> If money is tight then I just save it or</li>
            <li> Gel is tight and crunchy.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair and a little goes a long way here.</li>
            <li> My hair is still a little frizzy but that is not Miss Jessie&#x27;s fault.  </li>
            <li> but if I sleep on it my hair gets a little knotty.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long-way</li>
            <li> The smell can be a little overpowering</li>
            <li> Something with a little hold to it that will keep your curls</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth it for the price!</li>
            <li> I used a little and my hair did not frizz at all.</li>
            <li> I still have to use the sprunch spray to give it a little bit of hold, otherwise my hair will fall before I&#x27;m done with my work day.</li>
            <li> Eehh - a little stickier than I&#x27;d prefer.</li>
            <li> It even looks a little bit like it too.  </li>
            <li> I have been defusing which created a little frizz around my face, so I took a pea size amount and put it on the frizzy area and it worked perfectly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> yes a little like fabric softener</li>
            <li> Just a little water to \\&quot;reactivate\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The scent takes a  little getting used to, it smells like fabric softener.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the bad reviews except people used too much!!</li>
            <li> It was a little crunchy as it dried.</li>
            <li> I used this product on my little sister who is 12 and has curlier hair than I do with her curl being about as round as a dime and worked well but not as well as it did on me.  </li>
            <li> As a tip, don&#x27;t use too much of the stuff or it will make your hair look a little dull and feel a bit weird.</li>
            <li> My hair was still a little frizzy, but at least it didn&#x27;t look wet.</li>
            <li> After every shower I put it on her towel dried hair.</li>
            <li> A few things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For some reason Ms. Jessie&#x27;s products all felt heavy and drying as soon as I applied them to my hair.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
            <li> I should mention that I don&#x27;t like heavy products for my curls.  </li>
            <li> a few days use &amp; clarifying is necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> because all the things ive done to my hair but miss jessie would make the curls kinda like heavy</li>
            <li> I use it after I shower at night, run a bunch through my hair and then throw my hair up in a messy bun, buy morning</li>
            <li> A lot of these natural hair products are really expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it a few times, because I wanted to like it.</li>
            <li> This made my hair heavy and it felt sticky as well.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of smelling like coconut and pinapples and such.</li>
            <li> You put it on towel dried, combed hair and then cruch and twirl your hair to encourage the curls.</li>
            <li> Ok so after reading all of the reviews about this product with its very bad smell - I ordered it anyway.  </li>
            <li> When I followed the directions on the product by using it on freshly shampooed/damp hair, I was a little disappointed at the &amp;#34;crunch&amp;#34; left behind - and the fact that I had to massage and comb out that &amp;</li>
            <li> Very heavy, weighs hair down.</li>
            <li> but for some reason I got small tight curls in some areas and in others I just got a frizzy curl.</li>
            <li> however it makes your hair dull and weighted down</li>
            <li> If I plan on straightening my hair, I usually have to shampoo a few times to get it all out.</li>
            <li> I would much prefer to smell like fabric softener than some of the other artificial scents they put in hair products!</li>
            <li> The product is blue which is a little weird for something you put in your hair.  </li>
            <li> only issue I do have is that the product can be a little difficult to wash out.</li>
            <li> I have very tight curly hair, and an always looking for something to lengthen my curls and reduce frizz.</li>
            <li> I guessing this would work well for hair that is naturally very tightly curled.</li>
            <li> am white and my hair is neither particularly thick nor thin, but it is an unruly type of curly/wavy.</li>
            <li> OMG makes my curls big and fluffy!!!!</li>
            <li> When my hair dried, it was crispy with a medium hold (which was too hard for me).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep messing with it, but I&#x27;m just not sure what to think.</li>
            <li> I find that a small amount works.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure where this fits it</li>
            <li> Usually my curls need a lot of TLC and re-scrunching, and often feel product/heavy.</li>
            <li> and I wouldn’t suggest applying it close to the scalp because usually these hair products create a build-up anyways.</li>
            <li> Not sure whether I just haven&#x27;t found a product</li>
            <li> and in the past 6 months I had been using &#x27;be curly&#x27; by Aveda but decided to take a chance on this product as I do like to change it up every now and then.</li>
            <li> I usually use mousse from Pantene, Dove, Suave or Herbal Essences.</li>
            <li> I was really anxious to try it.</li>
            <li> Almost past shoulder length and this baby</li>
            <li> Besides how costly it can be, I&#x27;m not sure I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I have frizzy small curls</li>
            <li> FOR NO MORE THAN 2 DAYS  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this a few times and I&#x27;ve noticed that it weighs down my thin hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick and wavy hair that I used to use Tresseme Curl Mousse and Aussie sprunch spray to tame.</li>
            <li> I really wish it didn&#x27;t break out my face :(</li>
            <li> I have curly 3A/B hair, thin, and I typically use Aveda&#x27;s Phomollient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why the hair ends up hard and greasy with no body.</li>
            <li> Or they make my hair hard and crunchy</li>
            <li> Some reviewers have complained about the smell.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this three star because of the price, the build up and the fact that it didn&#x27;t quite work on my delicate curls.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m using at least a quarter size squirt of this on my hair.</li>
            <li> At least I do.</li>
            <li> Slightly thick texture.</li>
            <li> my hair is just too thick and corse for this product&lt;</li>
            <li> It does offer a loser curl, softer curl (no crunchy curls here) but there are other product on the market that work as well and aren&#x27;t as expensive.  </li>
            <li> When I use those expensive leave in conditioners my curls look weighed down and not bouncy.</li>
            <li> I canr move my hair and it not stab me in the eye from being too stiff and not turning into a fro!!</li>
            <li> I have very thin, slightly wavy hair.</li>
            <li> It is a little expensive</li>
            <li> My hair was not very curly at all and looked dirty.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it was too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> First of all, it smells terrible.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.!!!</li>
            <li> It looks weird and it&#x27;s a little expensive</li>
            <li> This product is also very expensive and was not right for my hair.</li>
            <li> Game me ramen noodle curls, despite stating on the bottle that does not give you ramen noodle curls.</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel heavy, greasy, and dirty.</li>
            <li> But trust me, there are worse things.</li>
            <li> I was getting annoyed.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t decide what&#x27;s worse</li>
            <li> Anyway, not great for me (I&#x27;ll stick with what works for me</li>
            <li> The consistency isn&#x27;t bad, almost like your average hair gel.</li>
            <li> i thought people on here were just being dramatic...</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and hate the wet crunch look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the baby buttercream and the regular curl cream and absolutely hated those products.  </li>
            <li> I hate the crunchy feeling I get from other products</li>
            <li> Sorry to be dramatic, but this stuff changed my life.</li>
            <li> did a lousy job.  </li>
            <li> This products works but leaves a weird residue when it drys.</li>
            <li> oh well i guess ill</li>
            <li> It was WAYYYYY to expensive for my pockets</li>
            <li> I will definitely echo the fabric softener stuff - it smells an awful lot like Snuggle brand softener.</li>
            <li> Well, I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical to try this product</li>
            <li> unfortunately i do</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too expensive not to work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey but not as expensive as some of the items out there</li>
            <li> (sounds creepy I know, but bear with me).</li>
            <li> Way too expensive</li>
            <li> Yeah, it looks weird</li>
            <li> I had been dying to try this &amp; ran into very poor customer service from the Miss Jessie&#x27;s site.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both were itching our scalps like crazy until we washed our heads.</li>
            <li> I suppose I could straighten my hair with heat and harsh chemcials, but that takes tons and tons of time, plus it&#x27;s just terrible for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This tends to make my hair look dirty.</li>
            <li> I have crazy curly hair.</li>
            <li> I get a bad headache every time I use this stuff from the scent of it.</li>
            <li> It makes me wonder what&#x27;s in it that makes it stink so bad.</li>
            <li> and he said it smelled like Downy, but not in a bad way.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll notice that it smells like fabric softner, which isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing, but doesn&#x27;t go away with time.  </li>
            <li> It literally gave me a headache and made me sick to my stomach.  </li>
            <li> Well, I am really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed after using it.</li>
            <li> Tamed my crazy curls!</li>
            <li> and I HATE IT</li>
            <li> I have ringlet curls and hate the way they feel when I have to mouse and hair spray them</li>
            <li> I hated the way a lot of products made my hair crispy.</li>
            <li> I usually hate using hair product because the results are terrible:</li>
            <li> Another fproduct for the graveyard, but at this price I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This stuff was DISGUSTING.  </li>
            <li> but the worst part is the smell.</li>
            <li> this product was terrible (for my hair)  </li>
            <li> Worst mistake ever.</li>
            <li> , it was horrible.</li>
            <li> It was terrible.</li>
            <li> but if that&#x27;s the worst part of this product what are y&#x27;all complaining about.</li>
            <li> And I can not get this waxy disgusting residue out of my hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate my hair anymore!</li>

            <li> I have 3a hair and this really does leave my hair nice and soft and at the same time does the job. The smell is strong - fortunately, it smells great. They could still benefit by making the scent a little more mild. I can understand totally if someone thought it was overbearing. I really wish it didn&#x27;t break out my face :( Also, a little goes a long way with this product.</li>
            <li> I lost all of my hair due to chemotherapy treatments. When it came back in it came back with very tight curls and even after a year it is still curly. I had absolutely no idea how to fix it but this product is amazing. This company makes multiple products but for Caucasian hair that is very curly I couldn&#x27;t recommend this product enough.</li>
            <li> Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls is the product I&#x27;ve been searching for, and believe me, I&#x27;ve been on a twenty-year hair product search. This lotion provides just enough hold for my fine, curly hair without crunch, shrinkage and flaking. Initially I was a little put off by the comparison to fabric softener, but in practice I find the scent to be fresh and not at all overwhelming. I live in the hot, humid, sticky South so I do use quite a bit of this product to help eliminate frizz. I put this stuff in my towel-dried hair and off I go. I scrunch after my hair has air dried to release some of the extra lotion. All in all, this is the best product that I&#x27;ve ever used and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have a huge complaint with the shipping department at amazon.  Who every packaged this product and a book that I purchased at the same time did a lousy job.  The liquid from Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls was all over the book.  I had to clean everything off before I could read the book or use the product.  They shipped both products together and not even in a box.  The product I love, have been using it for 2 years and still like the way it works in my hair.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I have very thick naturally curly hair, and in the summer time I just use this product and wash n go!  I used to use frizz serum, mousse, gel and hairspray...Now, all I need is this product for perfect curls!</li>
            <li> I am not a racially diverse gal but I have curly frizzy hair.  I was using Miss Jessie&#x27;s Quick Curls but found that it left my curly hair a little crunchier than I would like.  I next tried Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls and love it!  It does what it promises, makes my curls soft and defined.  My hair is still a little frizzy but that is not Miss Jessie&#x27;s fault.  The product is blue which is a little weird for something you put in your hair.  I noticed a scent but I don&#x27;t think it is too strong - maybe I&#x27;m not using as much of the product as other folks.  I do wish is wasn&#x27;t so expensive, but it is a great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products including all the name brands. Some work better than others but Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow&lt;br /&gt;Soft Curls is by far the best..... Nice Smell,  Leaves curls soft and holds the curl for a very long time....</li>
            <li> I have tried dozens of products for my hair. From the cheap to the very expensive. This is hands down the best. Not even close, it&#x27;s the real winner</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair that will curl on its own on a good day but this did nothing.</li>
            <li> This products works but leaves a weird residue when it drys. It looked like horrid dandruff on my entire hair strand.</li>
            <li> Purchased this after watching a Youtube review.  Did not get the outcome I was hoping for and tried several times changing amounts applied to my hair.  Just did not work out for me, and I felt the &amp;#34;fabric softener&amp;#34; scent was almost overpowering.  I really wanted to like this, but it just did not work for me.</li>
            <li> a great product for my hair...does not leave it stiff..</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this! My mixed race child has a hard time with her hair getting frizzy after wearing it down all day. She wore it down three days in a row with this product. Smells great too</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both have naturally curly hair. This is all we use. I don&#x27;t know what we will do if they ever  stop selling it! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!</li>
            <li> I LOOOVE this stuff!!! i have mixed hair... somebody told me 3a and 3b...shoulder length....OMG makes my curls big and fluffy!!!! no crunch at all! i only gave it a 4 star bc of two things...its 22 dollars ugh, and im not really rolling in the dough, but oh well i guess ill just stop getting my nails did lol....and the 2ns was the smell...i thought people on here were just being dramatic...but omg it is a very powerful laundry smell. it actually is so strong i have gotten a headache or two. but oh wellll pain is beauty dahhhling</li>
            <li> Helped to make my hair less &#x27;fro&#x27; and more FABULOUS! It made my curls into voluptuous, barrel curls. Love it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind it though. I don&#x27;t have much of a natural curl right now, because I&#x27;ve recently had my hair relaxed, but if I but a dab of this on my hair with curlers and let it dry, oh my god. It&#x27;s beautiful. I&#x27;m falling in love with my hair for the first time ever!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product to encourage my hair to curl without being frizzy. I scrunch it into my wet hair and then just pick it out with my fingers once it dries. You can even refresh the curls the next day with a little water and a tad more product. My hair is dry (color-treated) and medium weight. This product really promotes lovely curls on the longer part and adds some nice texture to the rest.</li>
            <li> I swear by this product! Makes my curls stay in tact without looking greasy ! LOVE !!</li>
            <li> This gave me well defined soft curls for my wavy/curly hair.  Usually i let my hair air dry to keep curls defined but even with a diffuser it worked great.  Smells just like Downey fabric softener which i happened to like.  I like Miss Jessie&#x27;s Transitioner&#x27;s Magic a little bit better just because i have straight parts in my hair.  Check that one out too.</li>
            <li> Product has a chemical smell.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!! It gives you soft nice curls without frizz and without that wet crunchy look that gel &amp; mousse can give. And it smells like a spa :)</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length fine hair and my curls were noticably crisp</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I brought this product one day at work because I did my co-wash the night b4 and my hair was completely dry the next day at work.  I couldn&#x27;t take it.  All I wanted to do was moisturize my hair for the day and I was going to return it to Walgreens the same day.  It was WAYYYYY to expensive for my pockets and I had plenty moisturizing products at home.  I went into my bathroom at work, wet my hair with my spray bottle that I keep in my desk and put this product in sections on my hair, my hair transformed like I have never seen it transform before.  I couldn&#x27;t return it, I&#x27;ve used up 90% of the bottle and have had great results, although because of the cost, I don&#x27;t use it everyday, I use a leave in conditioner or refresher products along with my oils (almond, coconut, evoo and glycerin mix).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thought I would try Jelly Soft Curls brand because it was cheaper ($14) and I HATE IT, returned that to Walgreens the next day.  I guess I will be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li> Caucasian lady with wavy hair.  This stuff is great but if I sleep on it my hair gets a little knotty.  Not NEARLY as knotty as with other products though so well worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not quite sure how I feel about this. I purchased a sample 1oz packet before shelling out $25 for a full sized tube, and even that was $7! I&#x27;m Caucasian with fine wavy/curly hair. I usually just let my hair air dry and do its thing, afterwards taming it with styling cream. I&#x27;m not as offended by the smell as some, and I&#x27;m sensitive to smells. It does smell like fabric softener, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s overpowering. It smells like clean clothes, fresh out of the dryer, and it does fade over the course of the day. Now, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m just incapable of using the small amount of product other reviewers recommend, but so far every time I&#x27;ve tried it, my hair feels heavy and crunchy! It doesn&#x27;t matter how careful I am to not overuse it. It does give me more defined curls, and after its dried I run my fingers through it to loosen up the crunchiness. I&#x27;ll keep messing with it, but I&#x27;m just not sure what to think.</li>
            <li> this product has truly changed the texture of my hair.  my hair is over processed between coloring and perming.  the last perm i got really fried my hair and i couldn&#x27;t blow dry it without frizz.  i bought this and used it for several nights and my hair is soft, smooth and easy to manage.  when i wash my hair it feels so soft and conditioned.  no more frizz when i do blow dry and when i don&#x27;t...soft hair that feels and smells fantastic.  its like fabric softener for your hair.  can&#x27;t even tell you how good your hair smells with it!  going to order more of their products to see if they work as good.</li>
            <li> At first I thought the product was nice due to not leaving my hair &#x27;crunchy&#x27; to bad the body didn&#x27;t stay for more than 20 minutes and regular products keep my hair curly all day long.</li>
            <li> I love this. I have natural fine 3a/4a hair and this works amazing. Doesn&#x27;t make my hair weighed down and I have definition for days, even after a while when my hair is frizzy. It smells like fabric softener (I love the smell btw) because it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;fabric softener&amp;#34; type styling lotion. They tell you this on the bottle lol. I pair it with a ECO gel first then I add the pillow soft lotion so my hair won&#x27;t be crunchy from the gel. It leaves my curls soft and popping.</li>
            <li> Game me ramen noodle curls, despite stating on the bottle that does not give you ramen noodle curls. Smells like putting laundry detergent in hair. Very strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li> I will definitely echo the fabric softener stuff - it smells an awful lot like Snuggle brand softener. I bought it thinking eh, I don&#x27;t mind that smell, but others picked up on it too so keep that in mind. One of my friends immediately said I smelled like dryer sheets!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have natural curl/waves that tend to disappear the moment it gets warm or dry. I don&#x27;t really like having to fuss with my hair a lot either, though. This works perfectly: I put a small-ish dollop through and just scrunched a lot and let it air dry. Lots and lots of curls and none of that gross gel feeling whatsoever! I love it.</li>
            <li> Best product I have ever used! I have recommended this to everyone I know with curly/wavy hair. I have not straightened my hair since I&#x27;ve purchased it. You will not regret it!</li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic.it smells like downy to me. If you use too much, yes the smell can be over powering. But if you use a drop about the size of a dime or less, it will be perfect. It Takes The Frizz Out Of My Daughters Kinky Curls and makes her curls into these perfect little spirals. After every shower I put it on her towel dried hair.</li>
            <li> love this product!  it brought my natural curls back to life!</li>
            <li> I am an African American with relatively soft hair and this stuff works great on my hair. I wet it in the shower, put massage Pillow Soft Curls in, brush and go. I tried another product but it didn&#x27;t work as well, there was lot of build up. No build up with this product and my hair is soft and curly. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by a friend.  She guaranteed that I would love this product and she was right! My naturally curly hair looks and feels amazing with this product.  Paying the price is totally worth it</li>
            <li> Awesome for long curly hair.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls&lt;br /&gt;Works great on my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I have curly hair and this helps keep my frizz down.  It also smells beautiful!</li>
            <li> Does a nice job of defining curls and keeping hairstyle in place.</li>
            <li> Love this product, yes the fragrance is STRONG, the first day thought I would never use again, so next day I used less and I guess I just got used to it, it really keeps my curls under control!</li>
            <li> Works well for a day or so. Leaves a lot of build up.</li>
            <li> I really loved the way all of the Miss Jessie products performed. Knits fell out so easily and actually loved the fabric softener scent of this particular one but I was really bummed because it made my head itch uncontrollably. My daughter and I both were itching our scalps like crazy until we washed our heads.</li>
            <li> I have frizzy hair that can&#x27;t decide to be wavy or curly. I put a tiny bit in my palms (about nickel size) and work it into my damp long hair. I could use more, but the smell is quite strong. I find that a small amount works.  When it dries, it has a nice beachy wave look to it, and it&#x27;s soft (not crunchy) and clean feeling to the touch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of products in my day...and I&#x27;m not sure where this fits it (not so helpful, I know). I have curly 3A/B hair, thin, and I typically use Aveda&#x27;s Phomollient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this a few times and I&#x27;ve noticed that it weighs down my thin hair. It does hold the curl, but it feels &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; (hair doesn&#x27;t feel clean, can&#x27;t do anything with it the next day when I want to put it up b/c it feels gross). It&#x27;s blue (why!?) and doesn&#x27;t smell great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on the weekends when I don&#x27;t really care what my hair looks like.</li>
            <li> What I&#x27;ve been looking for! I have pretty thick, kinda dry, frizzy kinky hair. I typically can get a good amount of curl with a lot of product (Aveda Be Curly) and a ton of scrunching. Usually my curls need a lot of TLC and re-scrunching, and often feel product/heavy. I opt for a ton of flat ironing most of the time instead. But, what I really want is smooth, loose waves that aren&#x27;t crunchy/ soaked in product or frizzy and of control. And that&#x27;s what Jessie&#x27;s pillow soft curls gave me! I use about two nickel size dollops and gently rake my hands through my hair (very gently to not totally separate the curls), then I used a tiny dollop of Aveda&#x27;s Be Curly, and gently scrunched. I let it air dry about 75% of the way, then used the blow dryer/diffuser combo to dry the last 25%.  Voila! Soft, smooth, waves... Kinda beachy and super easy!!</li>
            <li> The only positive thing I can say about this product is that at the beginning of the day my curls were defined and looked rather nice. However, by the middle of the day they were looking a little rough and this product makes my hair feel incredibly greasy. I&#x27;ve tried using less, but I don&#x27;t get great results and still have the residual greasiness from it. It also feels like I have something completely coating my hair. I don&#x27;t mind the scent, but it IS strong and DOES smell like fabric softener. Maybe if you have super dry hair this will work for you, but my normal to dry hair does not like it one bit.</li>
            <li> It gives me the curls and shine that I want, but I can&#x27;t stand the smell so I have stopped using the product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I’ve recommended to all my curly/wavy haired peeps! It smells great and as a person that has tried HUNDREDS of products from garnier to loreal kerestas to bumble and bumble to ouidad…etc This is one I’m sticking to as far as I can see! It leaves curls bouncy and full and waves luscious! amazon even sells it for a bit less that other places. If you haven’t tried it I strongly recommend you do, especially that it’s sulphate/petroleum…etc free so it will not hurt! A little goes a long-way and I wouldn’t suggest applying it close to the scalp because usually these hair products create a build-up anyways. I especially love it when combined with an Apple Cider Vinegar wash before!</li>
            <li> Indeed, very soft curls. I have small waves which get very frizzy because of hair dyes and hot tools. This cream reduces the frizz and makes the waves fluffy soft. I still add a bit of Oribe&#x27;s gel serum for a better definition and that creates the most defined and tamed look. And yes, it does smell like fabric softener, but I like it.</li>
            <li> This stuff was DISGUSTING.  I have very thick, coarse hair that rarely gets greasy, but this stuff took it to a new level.  I felt like I just poured a tub of Crisco in my hair.  I would never recommend this to anyone, unless you&#x27;re prepping your hair for dreadlocks.</li>
            <li> I had read that the smell was strong, but thought I would try it anyway.  It smells like fabric softener and its so strong it gave me a headache.  Great product, but can&#x27;t stand the smell.</li>
            <li> smell was strong and could not use this</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it claims. I put it on after my shower, go to bed and wake up with beautiful curls. It truly doesn&#x27;t get any simpler! I get compliments every time I use the product.</li>
            <li> I have 4a type hair. I usually use Kinky-Curly products but became intrigued about what Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls claimed to be able to do. For my first attempt, I decided I would use it on its own because I think a product that costs $22 should be able to work a little magic by itself. Well, I was wrong. I washed and deep conditioned my hair, then applied the Pillow Soft Curls. Yes, the curls were a little fluffier than when I use Kinky-Curly, but they were not big. They were soft once dried however on that first day. I didn&#x27;t feel the smell was too strong but that may be because I only used a dime-sized amount per section of hair (I divided my hair into 8 sections). The next day, the curls were dried out completely. So all in all, my first attempt rates as an epic fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my second attempt, I decided to use the LOC method (leave in, oil, cream). I co-washed with Shea Moisture Deep Treatment Masque conditioner. I separated my soaking wet hair into 8 sections. I applied Cantu Shea Butter Leave In Conditioning Cream, then Trader Joe&#x27;s jojoba oil, then a dime-sized amount of Pillow Soft Curls. Well, my curls are poppin&#x27;! There has been a lot of shrinkage, and I would not say my curls are a lot looser, but the definition and shine is amazing. They are less on the ramen-noodle side and more on the corkscrew side. It was a little crunchy as it dried. Today is the 2nd day and my curls are still defined (I pull my hair straight up into an old pair of stockings to sleep in), they are moisturized, and soft (any crunchiness is gone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, two thumbs up for the second try. However, for me, this product takes a few other products to make it work. Hence the four-star review.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, however, for as long as I can remember I have been blow drying it and straightening it which over time as caused my hair to become damaged and frizzy.  I have never worn my hair curly because I could never find a product that would keep my curls soft and not crunchy, as well as frizz free.  My hair is also cut in a bob which means it&#x27;s even shorter when curled.  I have decided to try and grow my hair out which means curly, heat free hair for a few months.  I am so glad I came across this product, I tried it out and my curls are soft and for the most part frizz free. Smells nice too! I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> One of the best products for soft curls!!! Love it!</li>
            <li> I have 3c curls up top and 4a corkscrew curls in the back.  Was skeptical to try this product but after my sister did a twist out with it i was SOLD. I used this product as a wash and go. Smell wasnt as bad as most ppl made it sound, product went in and spread very easily. I applied to damp hair which is suggested. I let it air dry and boom, big bouncy curls that expanded over night and were shirly temple like in the morning. This product did cause major shrinkage but it was expected, put my hair in a puneapple at night to kind of strech it.  Stayed soft all day and i love smelling my hair all afternoon. Husband wants me to buy it by the case! Will repurchase.</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about this product.  Lately I have been on a mission to find the best products for my type 3a curly hair and decided to try this product after having read the reviews.  A few things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Some reviewers have complained about the smell.  It is not unpleasant, and definitely not that strong.  So don&#x27;t be intimidated by the smell.  I don&#x27;t think that you can even smell it a couple hours after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;- This product definitely makes hair very soft, and does not make it crunchy.&lt;br /&gt;- A small amount goes a long way, be careful about not applying too much of it on hair.&lt;br /&gt;- Unfortunately, it did weigh my type 3a hair down and did not define my curls, took away from my hair&#x27;s natural volume, but this may be a great product for denser curls to ease them more.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of the rave reviews seemingly everywhere. It didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations. My curls are softer and there is no crunch- it is creamy, not a gel, which is another attribute I like.... BUT the biggest negative is that it seems like it takes much, much longer for my hair to air dry with this product in it.  My hair just seemed kind of weighed down, which is probably what increased that drying time.  I guess I will keep on the search for the perfect product for my kinky, wavy hair!</li>
            <li> This product is truly amazing it holds my curls in all day. They look so natural and feel so soft!!</li>
            <li> I got this specifically because people were complaining of the strong, fabric softener scent since I happen to love that smell, and wanted a product to get a bit more wear out of my unwashed hair. Sprayed day-old waves with some water and applied this cream and it&#x27;s great! Smells wonderful and gives just enough definition.</li>
            <li> Ms. Jessie&#x27;s hair products are really great. I always look on YouTube before purchasing any product to see how others feel. Well I. Heard great reviews about this product. Needless to say, I love this product and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I recieved my first tube of Super Soft curls as a gift. It works great. Soft curls with no build up and no greasiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish I could buy it locally instead of mail order.</li>
            <li> I seriously never review products. Not sure whether I just haven&#x27;t found a product I&#x27;m that over the top about or whether I just don&#x27;t want to take the time to do it. In any matter, this stuff is just too good not to review! I have wavy hair at best and this stuff works wonders for my hair. It has a ton of curl and no frizz! All I do is apply it when I get out of the shower, and then once it dries I use a little bit of bed heads after party because sometimes it&#x27;s too volumized and I need it to calm down. Other days I put it in after a shower and run out of the house and it still dries and looks great without the use of bed heads product. Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I have 2c-3a colored, right above the shoulder length hair. Without product my hair is very flat, frizzy and droopy. Not so great. The products I&#x27;ve used in the past always leave me with the wet or crunchy hair look, or they don&#x27;t hold enough to manage the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first tried this product by itself, about a quarter sized amount, it did not provide enough hold to give good definition. My hair was still a little frizzy, but at least it didn&#x27;t look wet. On my next attempt I used more product, ~half-dollar amount, which I scrunched in, then towel-scrunched to absorb excess, then diffused. It was way too much and my hair looked greasy. Next try, I used a dime-size amount of Pillow Soft with a dime-size amount of AG Recoil (which I was previously using, but it gave the wet look), scrunched into wet hair, towel-scrunched, diffused, et voila: I found the right combo! The AG Recoil gives just enough hold, the Pillow Soft gives great soft-curl definition and smells very nice. I also have the best second-day hair I&#x27;ve had with any other product. I recommend giving this one a try, it may work well for you on its own, or in combination with another product.</li>
            <li> This worked ok, still had spots of frizz and the smell of this is for sure overpowering. If you are sensitive to smell do not buy, every time I turn my head I smell fabric softener. I find the price to be too much for what you are getting too. I would not buy again, mixed chix leave in conditioner works way better!</li>
            <li> I have super fine hair and this product was too heavy so it didn&#x27;t enhance my curls just made them into waves. I also didn&#x27;t like the scent - it was too sweet and heavy although it wasn&#x27;t so bad by the second day. When I spritzed my hair with water it would revive the smell again. So I am returning this product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold my curls well but the worst part is the smell. I get a bad headache every time I use this stuff from the scent of it.</li>
            <li> Silky and smooth. Good for soft hair.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest product for taming my curls!! I stumbled upon this product by accident at Target one day last summer and I haven&#x27;t looked back. It eliminates frizz and curls my hair into perfect ringlets. The smell is a bit stronger than other products but at the same time it smells like baby lotion and not only do I get compliments on how curly my hair looks people also mention how nice it smells.</li>
            <li> My friend had recommended this product and I really like it.  It works really well to define curls and elimate frizzy hair. It can leave you hair with the stiffer feeling depending on home much you use.  It also has a different scent from normal hair products which I like a lot.I use without blowdrying and it works well.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product. I got a sample from BirchBox to try and I fell in love with this curl creme. I have fine, medium curly hair. This helps to define my curls with lightweight bounce and ZERO crunchiness. I love the smell- it smells like laundry! I use about a quarter size on wet hair and then diffuse for best results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for something to use on my 3a-3b (mixed african american and filipino) hair. ALWAYS. Mostly because I&#x27;ve never found that \\&quot;it\\&quot; product that worked for my hair. I&#x27;ve tried so many products including Ms. Jessie&#x27;s Curl Meringue, Curly pudding, and Butter Creme. For some reason Ms. Jessie&#x27;s products all felt heavy and drying as soon as I applied them to my hair. So I was pretty skeptical about trying Pillow Soft Curls...but babyyyyyyyyy,let me tell you......this stuff is magnificent!!!!!!!!!!! My curls are defined but soft! Until now, defined and soft had only been an oxymoron for my curls. LOL! My curls have NEVER been this defined and if there was definition with other products, they would be stiff and look dry. My curls are soft, shiny, and bouncy. This is the first time I&#x27;ve EVER had 2nd day curls. I swear I didn&#x27;t know what to do when I woke up and saw the same curls the next day (I put my hair up using the pineapple method at night). I used to have to re-wash and start over the next day. Honestly, I had given up on my dry naturally curly hair because I was tired of wasting money with the same results of dry and stiff curls. Sorry to be dramatic, but this stuff changed my life. I have nothing but good things to say about this product. Even the smell is great. It does smell like fabric softener, like it&#x27;s advertised. But I don&#x27;t think it is overbearing at all.</li>
            <li> I love how this works for my curls - I hated the way a lot of products made my hair crispy. But, the smell! It&#x27;s got WAY too much fragrance in it! Luckily the smell only lasts a day and I don&#x27;t wash my hair very often.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! Ive been looking for a one curl product that I can just put in my hair and walk out the house, and this is it for me. I have 2C-3A curly hair. It is a light hold and does not leave my hair looking greasy/wet/sticky at all. A little goes a long way as well. It defines the curls and controls frizz and fly aways well.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t loved all of Miss Jessie&#x27;s products; some are too thick or heavy, even for my 3B hair. Pillow Soft Curls is the best styling product I&#x27;ve ever used on my curls, and gives me the very best 2nd day hair I&#x27;ve ever had (usually, my first day is the best). The product is a little thick, and the only complaint I have is that my hair isn&#x27;t very shiny when I use it. The control, softness, and lack of frizz totally make up for lack of shine.</li>
            <li> love this hair lotion. It smells like fabric softener. Slightly thick texture. Apply to wet hair and it dries crunchy but when you run your fingers through the curls they get soft and not frizzy</li>
            <li> I love this product!!</li>
            <li> Omg the smeellllll I love the scent it&#x27;s like unicorn jizzed fabric softener in my hair. I don&#x27;t think it does much for frizz but i like that it&#x27;s not heavy like gel</li>
            <li> I finally found a product that actually works on my curly hair! It makes the curl defined without the crunch, gives it a ton of body, and it feels great. The smell can be a little overpowering but I am getting used to it.  Hoping it continues to work - sometimes products lose the effectiveness after some use - hoping this isn&#x27;t one of them.</li>
            <li> Perfect for wash and go styles!</li>
            <li> The biggest plus for me is the smell. I think this product smells amazing. I have very thin, slightly wavy hair. I was hoping i&#x27;d be able to just throw this product in and it would make my hair wavier so i&#x27;d have to do less work with a curling wand but it worked about the same that mousse or texturizing spray does for my hair.</li>
            <li> this product was terrible (for my hair)  i have long naturally wavy hair so i thought this would be awesome.  It wasnt. It made my hair feel heavy, greasy, and dirty.</li>
            <li> I like this product alot! It keeps my daughters hair really soft and manageable. The only issue I have is that her hair gets frizzy half way thru the day unless I use a palmade with it some leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for anyone with natural wave or curl in their hair.  Nice loose definition with no crunch.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. My hair is naturally curly and wild, and I have struggled for years and years trying to find a product that gives me the look I want. Finally the wait is over. This stuff gives me soft, defined, voluminous curls without weighing it down or making it hard and crunchy. Also, it smells great!</li>
            <li> The product works well, my only problem is the smell. I&#x27;ve never had a hair product smell so strongly of perfume. It&#x27;s extremely overwhelming! I unfortunately do not use as much as I need because I can&#x27;t tolerate smelling the perfume all day. I probably would not purchase again unless the smell was toned down.</li>
            <li> Bought this somewhere else because it was on sale. I had read all the rave reviews and was so excited to use it. Worst mistake ever. My curls were hideous and my hair felt very gunky yet very puffy and big. Yes it smells good, a little too good, but other than that, it was horrible. Even after I gave myself three shampoos, my hair still had residue in it. It has been over a week and I&#x27;ve washed my hair several times since then and my hair STILL has residue in it from this product. It also made my hair very dry so now when I try to blow dry my hair it looks gunky and dry. So yeah, I&#x27;m going back to mixed chicks leave in conditioner for when I want curly hair and hopefully next l want to blow dry my hair it will be back to normal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a leave in product that would work for me. After purchasing a new product every time I ran out of the old one, I finally purchased a second Pillow Soft Curls. I have medium length wavy hair that is frizz prone and inconsistent, but this product seems to have tamed it (most of the time).&lt;br /&gt;All this company makes is products for people with curly hair - so of course they know what they&#x27;re doing!</li>
            <li> I have searched everywhere for a product that would work on my hair; I have combo curly/wavy hair, and it&#x27;s very frizzy.  Great product and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love my curls when I use this product. My curls are super curly and soft. Can run my fingers through and they are such soft curls</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I have a chin length curly bob, with fine, curly hair. This product tames frizz, and holds the shape once the curls set.&lt;br /&gt;I apply about two peas worth, work through the hair, scrunch a bit, and allow to air dry. When my hair is almost dry, I fluff the curls with my hands to add some body. I wish the product provided a tad more volume for my thinning hair, but overall it does a good job.</li>
            <li> I have fine, medium thick curly/wavy hair and this product works great.  It does not weigh my hair down, but leaves it bouncy and with just the right amount of definition.  I should mention that I don&#x27;t like heavy products for my curls.  My hair is in a jaw length bob.</li>
            <li> While this stuff is recommended for kinky curly hair, I say it&#x27;s also good for wavy hair! My hair is very fine (but full) and wavy. This styling lotion helps bring out the waves. The lotion leaves my hair soft and manageable. It smells like fresh linens! It&#x27;s my go-to styling product for when I air dry my hair!</li>
            <li> I was not overly impressed with product.  Smells like fabric softener.  It did not produce results I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I am going natural and I love this product.  Curls, curls and more curls.  Love it. There is no built up on my hair and my hair is pillow soft just as adveristed.</li>
            <li> I had been dying to try this &amp; ran into very poor customer service from the Miss Jessie&#x27;s site. When I received some as a gift (it was on markdown at a local store), I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it. When I followed the directions on the product by using it on freshly shampooed/damp hair, I was a little disappointed at the &amp;#34;crunch&amp;#34; left behind - and the fact that I had to massage and comb out that &amp;#34;shellac&amp;#34; setting when my hair dried; however, when I used it on dry hair, I had better results. The funny thing is, the results get better after the second day - when you re-scrunch the hair with dampened fingertips. So, yes, it does help &amp;#34;encourage&amp;#34; (their claim) the curls, and it does make the hair feel soft. HOWEVER, I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s worth the price. For moisture, I find that the very reasonably priced StaSofFro works MUCH better (without a residue). If I can find the other Miss Jessie products in a trial/sample-size, I will try them, but I won&#x27;t be paying the full-price for the Pillow Soft Curls. I&#x27;m sure that there is a product out there that will &amp;#34;encourage&amp;#34; my curls without making my wallet sob.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, the PROS:helps achieve a nice curl; provides &amp;#34;just okay&amp;#34; softening (when compared to StaSofFro); will let you re-style for a few days before washing. CONS: price; instructions poorly given, causing user to have to rinse out/comb out the hard coating when it dries; leaves behind a bit of residue for the first couple of days; and, finally, doesn&#x27;t quite live up to the hair-softening hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think that this is worth a try, just because some of the poor results I experienced may be due to my hair type (between 4a &amp;4b). Maybe it will work better for those with a bit finer texture?</li>
            <li> Ok, so I rarely give 5 stars to anything!  Specially hair stuff!  But this product is IT!  I have fine wavy hair and have been looking for something that makes my hair soft while brining out my curls in frizzy miami.  I&#x27;ve tried around 50 products of ALL price ranges and this one takes the cake by far.  Other products either left my hair hard and sticky or it cracked when I tried to brush it.  But this gives it beautiful shape while being able to run my fingers through it.  It&#x27;s just delicious!  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I love that is doesn&#x27;t make your hair crunchy, but the smell is so odd! It&#x27;s like I have dryer sheets on my hair and the second day my hair is so sticky that I feel like it needs to be washed..... I will keep using it, but the smell is yucky.</li>
            <li> I seriously love this product. I was always someone who fought their curls. I was constantly blow drying and straightening my hair. I received a sample of this product and decided to try it, and I fell in love! The cream is lightweight, and only a small amount is needed for my long hair. My curls end up feeling soft, and it controls most of the frizz. A lot of reviewers seem to not really like the smell, but I actually like it! I get compliments all the time on how nice my hair smells (go figure)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I do have is that the product can be a little difficult to wash out. If I plan on straightening my hair, I usually have to shampoo a few times to get it all out. Otherwise, the ends tend to feel a bit greasy and stick together. But if that&#x27;s the only issue with this product, I&#x27;ll take it. I save so much time in the morning not having to straighten my hair, and my hair is now in much better condition and is growing faster, now that I&#x27;m not frying it every day!</li>
            <li> This is my very first review of any product on Amazon; I have been a prime member for two years. I have naturally curly hair and I wear it curly 95% of the time. I have tried and tested countless products over the years including hair gel, mousse, lotions, serums creams etc. and in the past 6 months I had been using &#x27;be curly&#x27; by Aveda but decided to take a chance on this product as I do like to change it up every now and then. This is my favorite curly hair product I&#x27;ve used in years and I want to order a lifetime supply now and it feels so good !</li>
            <li> I have used every product out there to give me define curls that wont make my hair like a board.  Nothing works like Pillow Soft curls. I thought the price was a little high for a prodcut I never heard of, but it was the best chance i took on a great result.  Think of what fabric softener deos to cloethes and thats what this does for your hair. My hair is shinny supersoft, defined curls AND holds the light clean smell ALL day!!! I STAND behins this product from a person who struggles with not having time to blow out my hair everyday and wants to know my curls will look great anytime I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to respond to this comment if you need advice, but I am telling you this is a great product and you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. I love it. I am a black man and very stylish. This improves the texture of my hair tremendously.&lt;br /&gt;It widens my curl beautifully. I just apply and leave in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I have 2b/2c curls.This product smells nice and went on easy, but weighed down my curls and they lost their definition. If you have very fine hair that gets limp and at times stringy, go for a gel instead. Something with a little hold to it that will keep your curls intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware that if you have fine hair, the ingredients in this product might possibly weigh it down. Silicones don&#x27;t work for everyone but for some people they work wonders. If they work for you, this is might be good product. If you feel like silicones typically weigh your hair down, this product may do just that. Either way, I&#x27;ve noticed that there is a build up after a few days use &amp; clarifying is necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this three star because of the price, the build up and the fact that it didn&#x27;t quite work on my delicate curls.</li>
            <li> As any woman with curly hair can attest, hair product can sometimes leave a crunchy curl or impart stiffness that doesn&#x27;t welcome putting your fingers through it... until now! I read about this product in Allure Magazine and even though I tend to be frugal, I sprung for the elevated pricetag to try Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls, and I&#x27;m glad I did! First of all, it smells fantastic, like a Downy dryer sheet. It produces a defined curl that is still soft, not stiff or &amp;#34;crunchy.&amp;#34; And don&#x27;t let the high pricetag fool you- a little bit of this stuff goes a long way. I have thick, long hair to my belly button and I still use maybe a quarter-sized amount and it&#x27;s all I need.  I let my sister use it when she was visiting and got her hooked, too! The best part is it&#x27;s cruelty free, so it&#x27;s a product I feel good about putting my hard-earned dollars behind. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells REALLY good.  Makes my grand daughters curls soft and fluffy, rather than tightly cured.  Only need a little bit and I&#x27;m still working on figuring out exactly how much and how wet the hair needs to be for optimal results.</li>
            <li> I can usually get my hair to be a strong 2B or a possible 2C curl if I use the right product. With this, I was only able to achieve 2A hair, very weak waves. Definitely not worth it for the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Caucasian female who&#x27;s battled frizzy, unmanageable hair for most of my life. I&#x27;ve wasted a sickening amount of money on products that made great promises but always fell short. Finally this is one that does exactly what it says it will. I&#x27;ve never seen my curls so frizz-free, silky soft, and bouncy. I was completely amazed. I will definitely buy this again and again, and I strongly recommend it. There are many comments here about the scent, but I use it sparingly and it doesn&#x27;t bother me in the least. Quite frankly, this product makes my hair look and feel so great that I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d care if it smelled like a hobo drenched in whisky. Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> I used to really love how miss jessie would leave my curls. They would be full and soft but this time i dont know if its because all the things ive done to my hair but miss jessie would make the curls kinda like heavy and they would become straight. Idk. But still like the product and it smells great.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely not what it is marketed to be.  As a person with naturally curly hair I was apalled at the quality of this product.  First of all, it smells terrible.  Second of all, it completely dried out my hair and made it WAY frizzier than it was to begin with.  When you pour the contents of the bottle into your hand you will see what I&#x27;m talking about.  I have used products for curly/frizzy hair my entire life-Sebastian, Bumble &amp; Bumble, Kerastase....this isn&#x27;t even close to being in that league let alone the non-professionial products you can buy at any store.  Not worth the money, and pretty much not worth it at all.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my hair so soft that I even use it when I&#x27;m going to straighten my hair. It also makes my curls so beautiful. I don&#x27;t recommend using a lot though. It works best when used sparingly.</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve found for fine, curly hair. Doesn&#x27;t leave it &amp;#34;crunchy!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It smells amazing and works just like it says.</li>
            <li> Very heavy, weighs hair down.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of enough words to describe how good this product is! After searching and coming up short my stylist recommended Miss Jessie&#x27;s to me....it is perfect.  Fresh scent (may be strong for some), light weight, and minimal build up.  I normally bought at Target but they are almost always out so I ordered from Amazon and the product was delivered very quickly....and TG, I was running on fumes.</li>
            <li> I have very tight curly hair, and an always looking for something to lengthen my curls and reduce frizz. It does smell wonderful, like Downy, but not overwhelming. It did not do what I was expecting for my hair, but nothing does. Another fproduct for the graveyard, but at this price I&#x27;m very disappointed. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference, and I&#x27;ve used it 3 or 4 times  now, each time trying something different.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion! It smells so clean. I use it after I shower at night, run a bunch through my hair and then throw my hair up in a messy bun, buy morning I have volumized curls that look and smell amazing!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t have the same result as Miss Jessie&#x27;s Quick Curls.  Just like it says, they will be soft curls.  Your hair will smell like fabric softener.  But trust me, there are worse things.</li>
            <li> it works very well, however the smell of it gives me headaches. Smells almost like fresh linen or laundry detergent</li>
            <li> I liked this product, it smells good, it makes my hair really soft and curly! I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> Anyone with curly hair will understand my next statement....&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a million hair products trying to get the right curl from my hair.  I&#x27;m liking this product a lot so far.  I use it along with a tiny drop of gel for control.  This really does give soft curls.  I was worried about the smell after reading some of the reviews, however, it&#x27;s not what some will have you believe.  Yes it has a clean, fabric softener smell.  But it&#x27;s not strong and my the time I add a little gel and blow dry my hair I don&#x27;t smell it much.  My husband or anyone for that matter has never mentioned the smell.  Its just not as strong as I was led to believe.  My opinion is...just try it.  I have also used the Curly pudding.  I think if you try the Miss Jessie products you&#x27;ll like them.  You&#x27;ll just need to find the right combo.  (My hair is a yucky wave)</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure this is something like Downey mixed with pomade because it looks, feels and definitely SMELLS like fabric softener.  It does however help to curl up my naturally curly thick Caucasian hair without ramen noodle crunch.  The smell is so over powering though I kept trying to figure out if I had spilled Downey on my clothes or something.</li>
            <li> Smells great and works wonderful!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  feels nice &amp; light.  Like many reviewers here have said, it does smell a bit like fabric softener, so if you&#x27;re sensitive to that, don&#x27;t get it.  It&#x27;s a bit high priced for what it does, which doesn&#x27;t really seem like much to me, I still have to add in other hair product to get my hair to not look frizzy.  I don&#x27;t have super curly hair, just wavy to medium curls.  Will use it up, but won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Did not make my hair curly but smells great.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine gave me some of hers to try after I complimented her amazing hair. I am sold on this stuff. I hate the crunchy feeling I get from other products so I rarely wear my hair down anymore. But this stuff kept my curls in place, soft, and non frizzy all day... even after being outside most of the day. I can&#x27;t wait to get more.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my naturally curly hair! It holds my curls in place with no frizz! Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It not only keeps my waves looking shiny and in tact, but it smells incredible. The smell can be a bit overwhelming at first though, so if you&#x27;re sensitive to scents I would just suggest not using too much of the product in one sitting. This lotion is great for me because my hair isn&#x27;t exactly curly, but it still needs hold and I&#x27;m not a fan of gels that leave my hair too crispy. I have waist long waves that tend to frizz up all over especially at the crown. Other hair lotions just give me shiny frizz, but this shapes my frizz into the shape my hair is trying to be. It&#x27;s not sticky, it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue, and it leaves your hair looking shiny and just put together. It lasted up to three days ( I can&#x27;t wash my hair everyday or it&#x27;ll dry out ) and smelled great the whole time. I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone trying to find their hairs&#x27; rhythm. I love this product!</li>
            <li> I love Miss Jessie&#x27;s products, but this one did not suit my hair. It remained frizzy, but left it looking greasy at the same time.</li>
            <li> works on my hair, calms the frizz and if I take the time to dry it I can create big soft curls with no stiffness.  I like the smell too.</li>
            <li> Love it! I put it on after I put on my leave in.</li>
            <li> Great product for my usual frizzy curls. Really does a fantastic job controlling the lioness mane. The only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because the smell is so strong. Smells like a laundry sheet, which isn&#x27;t so bad, but it&#x27;s SO potent I feel like people can smell my hair from 50ft away.</li>
            <li> Just pour a dab of fabric softener on your head. Should be called &amp;#34;Miss Jessie&#x27;s Homeschool Child Hair&amp;#34;. All I had was hair that looked like it had been brushed 100 times by my mother while reading Genesis.... it created an entirely new look for me yes, if that look is called &amp;#34;now l battling a severely persistent cowlick that smells like Downy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> great product, love it and always run out.</li>
            <li> Smells like fabric softener but the smell is not overbearing. My hair is a 3a and this stuff works wonders - keeps my hair in curls all day long.</li>
            <li> I won this product in a silent auction at my college. I have extremely fine hair, but my curls make it appear thick and full. I absolutely LOVE this product. After brushing out and slightly towel-drying my hair, I flip my head over and apply about a grape-sized amount to my hair. Because my hair is so fine, I let it air-dry (it only takes about 15-20 minutes). The result is beautifully shaped, soft, full, NON-frizzy and NON-crunchy curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why people complain about the smell. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any stronger than any other hair product, and it smells REALLY good and &amp;#34;clean.&amp;#34; I definitely recommend this product if your hair is similar to mine. I&#x27;m not sure how it would work on African-American hair, but because it works in my hair so well, I wonder if it might not offer enough control for coarser hair.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I wanted and was the size that was advertised. The size of the product was enough to last me for a month (with application several times a week on my shoulder length hair. I ordered the product because I wanted to add some body and strength to my natural kinky hair. My hair tends to puff out when dry, but when it is wet it has beautiful wringlets. I tried Pillow Soft Curls by Miss Jessie&#x27;s because it helps preserve the soft curls that I have when I exit the shower. The cost of the product (like most Miss Jessie&#x27;s products) is pretty steep, but the quality of the product is unlink any other that I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside (other than the cost) is that the product often needs reapplication EVERY DAY which can lead to product build up so I recommend a quick wash in the morning before you re-apply the product and be sure to do a thorough wash each week (for those of us with natural hair who tend to wash less frequently as to not dry out the scalp and hair). Overall, it&#x27;s worth the investment!</li>
            <li> Other than the fast shipping this product lives up to its name. I am not natural and I do not have curly hair......however this products makes my hair very soft and it smells so great. I have gotten a lot of compliments on the fresh smell of my hair.</li>
            <li> This product gives me the hair I&#x27;ve always wished I had.  The promises made are all the ones a curly girl has been waiting for.  It gives me thick, lustrous curling tendril and so much hair confidence I feel like I have super powers.</li>
            <li> I got a deluxe sample size of this pillow soft curl cream from my  monthly Birchbox subscription. I&#x27;m Latina and I have curly waist length hair. I usually use mousse from Pantene, Dove, Suave or Herbal Essences. However, they all give a wet look that leaves my hair crispy. I just wanted my hair to feel soft to the touch but still curly. When I use those expensive leave in conditioners my curls look weighed down and not bouncy. I absolutely loved this!  I used a little and my hair did not frizz at all. The curls were long but bouncy and curly. (Think Shirley Temple). I could cry I am so emotional about having grown up curls and not looking like I&#x27;m 19 anymore.  I pinned up my curls when I went to bed and when I woke up today my hair still looked great but my hair no longer smells like Downy ;)</li>
            <li> I should have heeded the warning of other posters.  Not only did this product do nothing for my naturally curly hair, but the smell was overwhelming.  It literally gave me a headache and made me sick to my stomach.  Not worth the time or money.  Immediately sent it back.</li>
            <li> Does the job! My hair is pretty thin but has nice curl to it if I use the right product and finally have found the right product!</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair and this is by far the top of all products I&#x27;ve tried. And over the yrs I&#x27;ve tried them all. Beautiful natural not stiff curls is what you have wearing this product</li>
            <li> I like the product, but do not see a noticable hold or impact whether i use or not, i will probably use more as a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> this is really good stuff.  makes your hair super super soft and relaxed curls.  i have shirley temple curls so it was a great change</li>
            <li> Love this! Hair is soft and looks neat, not crazy. Almost like a leave in conditioner for your curls or waves</li>
            <li> i have sensitive skin and the &#x27;laundry detergent&amp;#34; in it made my face break out (where my hair would touch my face)&lt;br /&gt;i would buy it again IF i didnt have sensitive skin. unfortunately i do</li>
            <li> Great for wavy curly hair.  Doesn&#x27;t leave it crunchy. The smell is ok, it smells like clean laundry (maybe even febreze). Works well loose curls.  Manages frizz.</li>
            <li> The best product I have found for my wavy hair. The curls are soft not hard like other products. I think it has even helped with some of my damaged hair to not be so dry.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this product!!! It&#x27;s better than any other curl product I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair and I&#x27;ve used a lot...Redken, Carol&#x27;s Daughter, Aveda, and all the store brands! I don&#x27;t understand the bad reviews except people used too much!! I think African American women have the tendency to think we need to slap a ton of product on our hair, be it grease, shampoo, or conditioner. That&#x27;s why the hair ends up hard and greasy with no body. I only use about a tablespoon and a half and my 3a/3b hair reaches the middle of my back at my bra strap. This product leaves my curls well defined, shiny, and they aren&#x27;t stuck together!!! I can move my head and my hair moves and has great body! I use as directed, starting with freshly washed hair that I only squeezed dry (towels create frizz). I apply the product about a dime size at a time and make sure not to touch it/style it too much (that also creates frizz) I let it air dry and my hair is good to go!!! I&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments since I started using it and the best part is I just spray my hair with a little water the next day, add a smig more product (about 1/2 a tablespoon) and the results are JUST as good!!! I am SOLD!!!!!</li>
            <li> Overpowering. Someone said it smelled like fabric softener. Fabric softener X100. To fe fair, I am a big fan of unscented beauty products. I can&#x27;t imagine what this would smell like if you were to wear any other scent. I only put it on a small section of my hair and it was soft and did produce curls but the smell did not fade during the day. So if you can&#x27;t handle strong fragrance, this probably isn&#x27;t the product for you.</li>
            <li> i love that my hair doesnt feel tangly... but i was expecting a miracle to increase my curl volume from straightning it so much</li>
            <li> I purchased Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls this week from Target. I was really anxious to try it. It say&#x27;s on the label that your curls will be soft and full, and not look like Ramen noodles, and that it feels really light on the hair. I shampooed my hair and applied a small amount, because some of the reviews said it smelled really strong if you used too much (I cannot tolerate really strong fragrances). Well, I am really disappointed. The reviewers were right, it smells just like fabric softner, and it made my hair feel tacky and dirty. My fingers felt like they had a film on them after I touched my hair. My hair was curly, but the smell and feel of it bothered me. I&#x27;m tired of getting stuck with these natural hair products that don&#x27;t work, or their fragrances are overwhelmingly strong.  A lot of these natural hair products are really expensive. I spent $22.00 for this at Target. I took it right back and returned it.I knew I was not going to try it again, and it would just wind up in the box with some of the other items that didn&#x27;t work for me. To be quite honest, I&#x27;ve used some of the cheaper products on the market that are not necessarily made for natural hair but are moisturizing, and they worked just as well.( ie. Garnier Fructis Sleek and Shine shampoo, conditioner, and leave - in conditioner for Frizzy, Dry, Unmanageable Hair, or Herbal Essences Hello Hydration shampoo and conditioner) work wonderfully with twist outs or braid outs. (your curls come out smooth, shiny &amp; well defined) My problem is, I need to stop trying new products and stick with what works. If it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it.</li>
            <li> Not only do I smell amazing all day long, my curly hair is soft and luscious. Love Love Love Love!</li>
            <li> great for curly hair with a fun smell</li>
            <li> Love this product. Keeps me hair curly even the next day!</li>
            <li> I have super fine, 2C/3A white girl hair.  I was hoping that this product would provide soft control and definition for my curls/waves.  I was hoping that this would produce an overall bigger curl.  This product kinda does those things, but doesn&#x27;t have nearly enough hold.  My hair looked decent for about 30 minutes before it completely dried, then become a frizzy mess.  I&#x27;m still experimenting with it - with slightly better results when I mix it with some cheap gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent - it does smell kinda like fabric softener.  I did not find it overwhelming at all, and just smells clean to me.  My new husband thinks it smells good - and could only smell it if he put his face in my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really noticed anything different about my curls with this product. If you are sensitive to fragrance, do not buy this. Clearly smells like a bottled of downy fabric softener. I have caucasian hair with natural wave.</li>
            <li> Great change form my normal routine</li>
            <li> I was hoping this curl cream was as amazing as some had said. While it didn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy like most curl creams do, it doesn&#x27;t make it &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;. It does change the texture. I don&#x27;t think it enhances my curl either. My hair curled better without the product in. Also, just a head&#x27;s up - if you workout make sure this is NOT in your hair! When sweating, it felt like my scalp and face was on fire! It&#x27;s way too expensive not to work.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way but wow!I have always had the crunchy, noodle curl and this left my fine curly hair defined, soft, and smelling great.</li>
            <li> I have thick and wavy hair that I used to use Tresseme Curl Mousse and Aussie sprunch spray to tame. I&#x27;ve replaced the mousse with Miss Jessie&#x27;s and I&#x27;ve really liked the result! I still have to use the sprunch spray to give it a little bit of hold, otherwise my hair will fall before I&#x27;m done with my work day. It definitely smells like laundry detergent, but I really like the smell (as does my husband). I put this in right after my shower while my hair is still wet and either sleep on it or just let it air dry and both work great, although I usually like the sleep-on-it result a little better. You definitely don&#x27;t need much! I probably use about a quarter sized amount total for my full head of hair. I&#x27;ll likely be buying this product again even though it&#x27;s pricier than my go-to mousse.</li>
            <li> Overpriced. made my hair feel icky smelled nice though</li>
            <li> I tried this  when I received a sample.  It left my fine 2B/2C hair weighed down and sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I think it is probably a good product for people with stronger hair/curls, It had the consistency of glue, it did nothing for me.  I am now trying lighter products and mixing product with water.  I probably should have tried that with this product.  Live and learn :)</li>
            <li> Great production. Make my hair smell good too</li>
            <li> Love this product! However, it has an overpowering scent of like a laundry detergent or febreze. Besides that the product keeps my curls poppin&#x27; like a gel without the crunch.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t to tolerate the smell !</li>
            <li> This leaves my curly hair nice and soft. The scent is pleasant and long lasting as well. Love that I no longer have crunchy hair.</li>
            <li> Does what it claims however it makes your hair dull and weighted down</li>
            <li> My hair looks good using this product but I cannot get over how greasy it makes my hair feel.  It transfers to my skin and hands easily during the day (yuck) and runs down my face when working out.  The cute curls are not worth the slimy feeling!</li>
            <li> Eehh - a little stickier than I&#x27;d prefer. I have thick, fairly coarse, curly not kinky hair.  This product turned out to be a heavier consistency than I like.  I thinned it with some rose water, which is allowing me to use it up rather than have it go to waste.  I guessing this would work well for hair that is naturally very tightly curled.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have curly hair and hate the wet crunch look. This product creates soft non-frizzy curls and you don&#x27;t even need to use a lot; in fact you don&#x27;t want to use a lot because I learned early on that using too much makes your hair a bit sticky. It&#x27;s a bit pricey but not as expensive as some of the items out there and it last a long time, one will usually last me 4 to 5 months and I have medium length hair.</li>
            <li> My initial review of this product was a bit negative.  However, I decided to give it another try.  I actually like it and I find that a small amount, maybe 1 tbsp, enhances my curls and leaves them nice, soft, and smelling great.  I use it after unpinning my curls, when my hair is dry.  Since going natural, I have made this product one of my regulars.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the way my hair looked the day I used this product, but the scent of it was just too much - there was a very strong chemical smell right from the start.  I thought maybe the smell would dissipate as my hair dried, but several hours later it was still so strong I had to pull my hair back (after checking with a coworker to make sure other people couldn&#x27;t smell it!).  Glad I had a sample to try and didn&#x27;t spend any money on it!</li>
            <li> You folks have no idea how happy I am. Ecstatic. Overjoyed. Gleeful. Delighted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get the point. Anyway, I have actually heard about this a long time ago through my best friend. I was chilling at her apartment, watching her get ready for us to go out (sounds creepy I know, but bear with me). She pulls out this tube and starts applying it to her hair. When I asked about it, she said it was good for taming curls. I dismissed it though. Her hair was the opposite of mine. Fine, straight-wavy, and much shorter. I thought it would only work for her. Meanwhile, my curls were a wild, frizzy mess that could only be tamed by tons of gel, mousse, hair lotion, and hairspray - yes, all at once. As the years went by, I started really hating the crunchy feeling I would get with my curls and eventually phased out of using the gels/mousse/hairspray for a while and started using leave-in conditioner and oils. But then I started to break out. I was getting annoyed. After a while, all I did was shower and braid my hair then go about my day. One day, I stumbled upon a review for this product on Makeup Alley (my go-to place for honest reviews besides Amazon) and everyone was absolutely RAVING about this product, even the wild-maned girls. So I decided to give it a shot. I showered, applied argan oil, then I applied this. Yes, it really does smell like Snuggle fabric softner, but I wasn&#x27;t too bothered by it. I let it air-dry and it LASTED ALL DAY! Heck yes! I have finally found my holy grail product! This better not get discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, some of the reviewers were complaining about the waxiness or filmy feeling of the hair. Yes, I do experience that a bit but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. SOMETHING has to hold the curls in place and, quite frankly, I&#x27;d rather have this (and my curls still be soft and playable) than crunchy hair. It is expensive but it&#x27;s SO worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now you understand my happiness. Do yourself a favor and get it.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of it and after using it I definitely could see that the product does what it says it will do. It provides bigger, softer curls than using gel, spray-gel, curl-creme or curl-mousse.  The scent is quite strong - it smells exactly like liquid fabric softener.  It even looks a little bit like it too.  I also had a bit of build-up from it the next day, but I didn&#x27;t mind that so much because I just re-wetted my hair a bit and used up whatever product was left in my hair from the day before.  I would like to purchase this product again because I did get nice results.  But it is a little high priced though.  If I get another sample, or a smaller tube of it, I will definitely dilute it with a little water, or, I just won&#x27;t use as much of it.  Doing so will probably cut back on the scent (if it&#x27;s too strong for some people), decrease the build-up and overall make it last longer to justify the price.  Note:  I&#x27;ve used the baby buttercream and the regular curl cream and absolutely hated those products.  So if you have fine, naturally curly hair like I do, try the pillow soft curls before you waste your money on the creams (they&#x27;re just way to heavy and greasy.)</li>
            <li> worked perfect for my hair where has this product been my whole life</li>
            <li> I have type 4a-b hair and this is the only product I&#x27;ve ever used that works do my hair! It makes it feel so soft and defines my twist out amazingly. I looooooove this and reccomend this product to everyone :-)</li>
            <li> Unlike women who mostly use the product, I am a biracial man (half black father and half black mother) with very soft, bouncy curls and my hair is about 3 inches long.  This product made my hair soft and defined my curls just like it said.  It&#x27;s not heavy and controls frizz pretty well along with adding a nice shine.  I find that this product only really works to its full potential only when freshly washing conditioning your hair.  I also think it works better on wet hair rather than damp hair like the bottle suggest.  I used this product on my little sister who is 12 and has curlier hair than I do with her curl being about as round as a dime and worked well but not as well as it did on me.  I would recommend this for people with a softer, less course curl. I also love the smell.</li>
            <li> Way too expensive and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair curly! Always looking for something to define the curls and calm the friz, this doesn&#x27;t do either. Smells great though!</li>
            <li> This product does indeed smell like fabric softener.  I have very fine hair, and this product left a weird, dirty feeling in my hair and it weighed it down.  My hair was not very curly at all and looked dirty.  It was terrible.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work like advertised.  I was disappointed after using it.</li>
            <li> My hair is in a transition phase of a faded keratin treatment and new, very curly hair coming in. Its hard to find a product that provides enough control for the new growth (very dry, frizzy, thick) without weighing down the less curly half. I sectioned my hair and applied a leave in conditioner (Giovanni) and then a little less than a dime sized amount of the Pillow Soft- all in all, about three dimes worth to my head. My hair does not look greasy, weighed down or crunchy - I have smooth, soft curls with definition! It DOES smell like fabric softener, but I did not find it to be too offensive or strong, and it has dissipated a lot since drying. I would much prefer to smell like fabric softener than some of the other artificial scents they put in hair products! So happy I tried this product, I have a feeling I will be sticking with it for awhile!</li>
            <li> This product worked well with my hair.  The curls were soft and looked great.  I got lots of compliments.  But I was hoping for long, loose curls and I didn&#x27;t really get that.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even focus on the product quality when I used this.  The smell is so strong!  Strong fabric softener is not something I want my hair to smell like.  It also leaves a residue on your hair.  I&#x27;ve showered twice since I used it and my hair still smells like fabric softener.  I will definitely not be using his product again!</li>
            <li> I have 3c curls by nature but opt to relax my hair.  If I dry my hair without straightening it, it looks like a frizzy mess with no real curl pattern or definition.  I combed a very generous amount of this through my damp hair and proceeded to tousle and blow dry my hair with a diffuser.  The result?  Soft, silky, 2b waves.  No frizz, nice definition without crunchy separation. I like the smell, but it is very strong (smells like fabric softener, as many say).</li>
            <li> I have 4b/4c hair and this did wonders for moisturizing and detangling. Plus I like the smell. It smells like fabric softener, but it softens my hair and gives it a great smell. Spray some water on my strands then coat it with this stuff, and the slip and texture of my hair is astonishing. I would most definitely buy this product once more. Trying to get me a new regimen going on, and this is definitely included as part of my calming detangling sessions.  Almost past shoulder length and this baby right here will get me to mid-back length and achieve the softness I desire.</li>
            <li> its a lot of product and has a aroma that may put you off at first. It is better for use on wet hair than dry. I probably would not buy it again but it lasts a long time on the shelf.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty sure I have 3a/3b naturally brown curls but with some heat damage on the top strands. My hair is of medium thickness but I have a lot of hair. After using a curling iron and damaging my hair, I&#x27;ve been working towards getting the top starts to curl more rather than wave and this stuff helps a lot! It smells great and my hair has great volume and the curls/waves tighten up nicely with no crunchy feeling. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: don&#x27;t use a whole lot. Mainly focus on putting it on the ends. All I really use is about a dime/nickel sized amount and it works great. If I double that amount my hair will be weighted down.</li>
            <li> Works great for my thick curly hair!  Only four stars because of the laundry detergent smell.</li>
            <li> This product flakes alot, Ive never had this problem with any other product ive tried and ive tried ALOT. I do enjoy the fabric softener smell however. It did not leave my hair like i wanted it my hair was frizzy and felt a bit dry.</li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my hair feel. Pillow soft hait is right. However, it leaves my hair smelling like laundry soap.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on my hair! And my hair is relaxed but still curls up. This made my &amp;#34;wet and go&amp;#34; days a lot cuter and sleek.</li>
            <li> I love how my hair feels and smells! Soft curls without having to use a ton of product! I have curly/wavy hair and yes with frizz! This help me to wash and go with soft hair instead of crunch an crust.</li>
            <li> This product weighed my hair down and made it feel greasy.  This product is also very expensive and was not right for my hair.</li>
            <li> Loving Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls. I do admit the &amp;#34;fabric softener&amp;#34; smell took a bit of getting used to, but was is not overly obnoxious and fades as the day goes on. I use this along with the Miss Jessie&#x27;s Super Slip Sudsy Shampoo and the DevaCare One Condition, No-Fade Ultra Creamy Conditioner. Helps define my curls without weighing then down or giving them that crunchy look and feel. For me, with the Pillow Soft Curls, a little goes a long way. Would definitely recommend and buy again.</li>
            <li> I really liked the way the product moisturized my hair and defined my curls.  My hair didn&#x27;t get crunchy like it does with other gels.  I would have kept using it but after one use, my face broke out and I started to itch all over my body.  I had to wash it out and take some Benadryl.  Too bad, since I liked the way my hair looked.</li>
            <li> This product does a great job of giving my curls definition, cutting back on the frizz, without leaving any crunch.  I have very long (mid-back) fairly coarse hair; the type would be 2C/3A depending on its length.  I can generally go about 3 days in between washes, but with this product I find myself having to wash every 2 days, or use a whole lot of dry shampoo on day 3 and pull it back.  I think this is probably because it&#x27;s made with avocado, coconut, sweet almond, and olive so the product has quite a bit of oil in it to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s funny that they call this fabric softener for your hair, because it actually does smell a lot like fabric softener.  The scent is fairly strong, and that is probably a turn off for a lot of people.  I find that after using it a couple of times, I don&#x27;t mind it so much and I&#x27;ll deal with it because of how good it makes my hair look.  If you buy this product, I would strongly suggest applying sparingly the first time and working your way up to using more, until you find an amount that works for you.  I used way too much the first time and my hair was grease-ball city.  A small peach pit size amount seems to be my ideal amount to define curl, and keep the grease to a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good product.  Probably one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used, as far as leaving me with soft, defrizzed curls.  If you can deal with your hair kind of, sort of smelling like a dryer sheet, it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times now, but I think this is as good as my curls are going to get.  My hair isn&#x27;t super curly and it&#x27;s really long, so the weight tends to pull the curl out.  This does a great job of defining the curls without a lot of frizz while still being super soft- no crunch!  I also have the Quick Curl Cream and this does bigger, rounder curls where as the Quick Curl Cream makes tighter, more spiral type curls but some how makes hair dry quickly which is great for wash and go.  Still want to experiment mixing the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a \\&quot;dryer sheet\\&quot; smell, but I feel like it dies down during the day.  I have been using a defuser, so maybe that has something to do with it?  I have read a lot of reviews where it&#x27;s just too strong for some people so I would suggest a sample first (the website will send you some).  I also didn&#x27;t have a \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; problem that some people had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions say to put on damp hair and defuse or air dry.  I have been defusing which created a little frizz around my face, so I took a pea size amount and put it on the frizzy area and it worked perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I say it&#x27;s totally worth the money!  You don&#x27;t need a ton, and keeps my curls for a couple days.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re big fans of Miss Jessie&#x27;s at our house, and love 99.9% of their products, but we won&#x27;t be buying Pillow Soft Curls again unless they change its fragrance. It smells like a very sweet fabric softener, and the scent is heavy enough that people around my daughter comment on how her hair smells when she uses it -- and not in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, we enjoy the styling benefits of Pillow Soft Curls and would purchase it again if Miss Jessie&#x27;s changed its fragrance.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the comments on the smell -- someone nailed it and said it smells like fabric softener and I thought BINGO!  That&#x27;s exactly right!  I&#x27;m one of those who puts extra fabric softener sheets on my bedsheets &amp; towels, so I suppose you have to be predisposed to liking the smell.  That being said, I love how my hair feels.  I used to use a leave-in spray conditioner that left my hair curly yet soft, but can&#x27;t find it any longer.  This does the job!  No crunch, no stiffness, but definition and no frizz... I just love it and am so happy to have found it.</li>
            <li> My hair type is Curly 3a-b (some of my locks are spiral, others \\&quot;s\\&quot; shaped).  I usually hate using hair product because the results are terrible: flat hair on top, curly on the bottom; tight, crunchy curls; and the worst, tight crunchy curls on parts of my head, enormous frizz on the rest.  And my hair is FRIZZY without product so I can&#x27;t decide what&#x27;s worse: super frizzy hair or weird product-coated hair.  What I usually do is shower, brush out my hair, coil it into a bun and secure it in place.  It&#x27;s a shame, too, because I know my hair could be beautiful if it the curls were defined properly.  I suppose I could straighten my hair with heat and harsh chemcials, but that takes tons and tons of time, plus it&#x27;s just terrible for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then enter Pillow Soft Curls.  Yes, it has a strong perfume scent - but I love sweet scents so it worked out fine for me.  I brushed out my hair, flipped it upside down, and rubbed the cream in my hands and scrunched my hair like I would any other gel or cream.  I let it dry and magically my curls bounced into beauty and when I squeeze my hair I don&#x27;t hear the uniquitous crackling you normally get with hair products for curls!  My hair is shiny, voluminous, curly, and overall lovely.  I only have the sample packet but I&#x27;m definitely going to buy more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, everyone is different but this is the best product I&#x27;ve used so far, and my curls are usually out of control.  I finally feel like my hair looks the way I want it to.</li>
            <li> MY FAVORITE PRODUCT FOR MY DAUGHTER&#x27;S CURLY HAIR.....AND SMELLS FANTASTIC!!!</li>
            <li> Works great for my curly hair</li>
            <li> Very off putting smell, did not live up to it&#x27;s claims, more sticky then soft. I did however like the packaging.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading a ton of great reviews about the product. Bought my first and only bottle at Walgreens (also sold at Target). It smells pretty good, almost like Downy or laundry detergent. The consistency isn&#x27;t bad, almost like your average hair gel. My curls are a &amp;#34;tybe b&amp;#34; and can be very dry and very frizzy. My main concern/goal whenever I&#x27;m looking for a new product is curl definition without that crunchy result. This product gives you what it states &amp;#34;pillow, soft curls&amp;#34;. It keeps my hair relatively frizz-free and mostly defined curls.&lt;br /&gt;The downside; when I tried to straighten my hair after almost 3 weeks of curls and continued use of this product, my hair was waaay more difficult than normal. I made sure to shampoo and condition and wash as thoroughly as possible but it still left a weird residue behind. Straightening my hair took longer than normal. I can&#x27;t describe exactly what I mean but I knew it had something to do with this stuff. Besides how costly it can be, I&#x27;m not sure I will purchase this again. I&#x27;m on the lookout and already researching different products.</li>
            <li> No notice in am improvent in my curls. Leaves my hair kind of heavy and sticky. Possibly better for leople with super curly hair as I just have wavy.</li>
            <li> Original bought it for my styles but didn&#x27;t like how it felt on my hair. But I discovered it worked great on my weave extensions. It keeps frizz away and keep my hair from tangling so much</li>
            <li> Both my husband and son have naturally curly hair and this product works great to make their hair tamed!</li>
            <li> The item is as described, but not what I hoped it would be.  The smell is very strong and not pleasant.  The seller was great tho and I have no complaints on that end.</li>
            <li> This is hair crack that&#x27;s what we call it anyways. I have searched high and low for something that does what miss Jessie&#x27;s does. Before I had to use 4 products have an hour to do my hair and then maybe I could have a good hair day. With this it&#x27;s 5 mins only one product and I&#x27;m ready to go. My curls are huge and soft so freaking bouncy !!! And the shine is amazing! I&#x27;m half black half white my hair has 3 different curls and is nothing but frizz with no product. I can&#x27;t explain how this stuff has changed my life. It&#x27;s amazing. I don&#x27;t mind the smell at all. It smells clean yes a little like fabric softener but if that&#x27;s the worst part of this product what are y&#x27;all complaining about. It is a little expensive but I spend more on all the products I used to buy and get s***ty results. If money is tight then I just save it or those days I really need to look amazing. If you have had problems finding something that works with your hair try this you won&#x27;t regret it !</li>
            <li> I am mixed race and have wavy/curly hair. This product should not be called &amp;#34;Pillow Soft Curls.&amp;#34; I must admit that I love the smell of this product, it really smells like liquid fabric softener.  I applied the product as directed on the bottle.  When my hair dried, it was crispy with a medium hold (which was too hard for me).  It also felt like there was a residue or coating on my hair.  My hair was not soft at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I formerly used a product called &amp;#34;Curly Perm&amp;#34; Activator Lotion.  It was made by a company called M &amp; M Products, but they have stopped making it.  I am 40 years old and have been using &amp;#34;Curly Perm&amp;#34; Activator Lotion since I was 15 years old.  And now I am back to trying to find just the right product all over again.  I am looking for a product that I can put in my hair after I wash and condition it, that will leave my hair soft and fluffy like a body wave when it dries, without a hold, without a residue/build up and without my hair feeling greasy.  &amp;#34;Curly Perm&amp;#34; Activator Lotion was the only product that gave me the results that I am looking for.  I guess I will have to just keep on looking!</li>
            <li> This is amazing! Wavy hair finally something that actually works!! Love it the smell and everything!!</li>
            <li> Love it and leaves your hair super soft.</li>
            <li> I just finished a bottle of this product, and it works great. I ha e naturally curly hair that I wet-set for manageability. This product  leave my hair so soft, and it smells great- like baby powder. This will be a staple from now on.</li>
            <li> this is just perfect for me, i&#x27;m a rinse and go type of chick. so i rinse, put this in my hair and let it air dry and my hair comes out fluffy with soft curls. it looks so cute every time! if i wanna look like i did any kind of styling to it, i twist a section of it and clip it back . looks so cute and i always get compliments.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after receiving a sample through a subscription service. I have generally unmanageable hair and needed something to help define my curl without weighing my hair down. This totally fit the bill! A little goes a long way in damp hair, and curls can be quickly refreshed with a quick spritz of water. I&#x27;ve also found that this product practically eliminates the need to condition my hair after every wash. I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase and will be reordering as soon as my bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> This is okay as far as setting my twists but the smell is absolutely horrible. It never fades. It makes me wonder what&#x27;s in it that makes it stink so bad.</li>
            <li> Ok so after reading all of the reviews about this product with its very bad smell - I ordered it anyway.  Here is the real scoop on it.  The product is amazing. Although the smell is strong- it disapears after a short while but even the next day my hair has a nice fresh smell to it.  I have frizzy small curls and I want bouncy big curls at the bottom only.  This is what Miss Jessie&#x27;s product does.  I blow dry with a round brush and my hair is soft and frizz free and has nice big round curls where I put them.  I used it once with my hair drying naturally and it was the same thing - soft curls.  Mousse makes my hair big and fuzzy.  Gel is tight and crunchy.  The Pillow Soft curls does just that - soft curls.  I do admit that the smell is very powerful out of the tube.  But it a clean smell and it does go away after a short while  But I love that I can go 2 days without washing my hair because it is not greasy or gummy and the smell is still fresh.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for my daughter&#x27;s bi-racial hair. She looks salon perfect every day. She loves her curls with this product. Heaven sent!</li>
            <li> Used the product on my kids hair and their curls where beautiful. My new fav product. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> love the smell and the product!</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair.  Miss Jessie&#x27;s gives me great curls without looking sticky or starched!  I love it!</li>
            <li> Best curl product I&#x27;ve ever used! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is the best curly hair cream I have ever used. Hands down. It&#x27;s pricey but definitely worth it. A full bottle lasts me about 3 months - I am caucasion and have curly hair about 2 inches past my shoulders. My curls are bouncy and soft and I rarely get frizz now. I can even go to sleep with damp hair in a crazy bun on top of my head, and with this cream when I wake up in the morning and take my hair down it&#x27;s almost perfect. If you&#x27;re on the fence about it because you haven&#x27;t had that miracle hair cream yet, this is about as close as you&#x27;re going to get. It&#x27;s awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Reading a few reviews it seems people are really averse to the smell. It DOES definitely smell like dryer sheets when you initially put it on. I find that it doesn&#x27;t last more than a couple minutes however and I&#x27;m using at least a quarter size squirt of this on my hair. I never had a problem with dryer sheet smell though and always like how my clothes smell when they come out of the dryer, so even if it did last I wouldn&#x27;t have a problem with it. I presume I would just smell like clean clothing - which isn&#x27;t really a bad thing?</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous! My hair is soft and curly, works great! Also holds extremely well for curling hair.</li>
            <li> While an OK product, it doesn&#x27;t really lengthen or smooth curls.  I&#x27;m not crazy about the fabric softener smell, either.</li>
            <li> So far has worked great in my hair BUT im almost positive all it is is fabric softener....lol how genious lol but the scent is EXTREMELY STRONG i thought the other reviews were just from sensitive PEOPLE....nope!! It really is VERY strong!! But it does do as it says!! My hair is untammable and its pretty well tamed! I canr move my hair and it not stab me in the eye from being too stiff and not turning into a fro!! So good product but crappy smell!! Def work on that!!</li>
            <li> The scent of the cream is lovely. It has such a crisp and clean scent that I often find myself pulling my hair close to my nose to breath it in. The consistency of the cream is light in weight and density, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about the cream creating an oily/greasy appearance on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, on the cream&#x27;s official claims, it does not maintain curls/waves throughout the day. While I&#x27;ll notice minimal curls form in my hair after first application, the curls/waves quickly fall flat, leaving a disheveled appearance in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have ringlet curls and hate the way they feel when I have to mouse and hair spray them so they look decent. I&#x27;m always blow drying my  hair. I noticed the damage &amp; conveniently got this sample at Women&#x27;s show. I love the way it feels and smells.  My hair has just the right amount of volume and it&#x27;s been day 2 and my hair is still looking good. Just a little water to \\&quot;reactivate\\&quot; and we&#x27;re out the door. Waiting for my full size to arrive. Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Always getting compliments on how good my hair smells.</li>
            <li> I really had high hopes for this curl cream.  I have white girl wavy/curly hair and have been doing the curly girl thing for a few years. I have been pretty dedicated to the Deva line, but I wanted to try something new.  I bought this at a local retailer and was really excited to try it because it is aimed at producing looser, softer curls and I don&#x27;t like the crunchy gel curls. Unfortunately, it was too heavy for my hair. It did keep my hair very soft and was not the least bit crunchy, but it is probably much better for tighter curls or thicker hair types.  The fragrance, which literally smells like a dryer sheet, is nice but I thought it was too strong.</li>
            <li> I moved to North Carolina about a year and a half ago and immediately started having problems with frizzy hair. I have long thick, coarse, damaged naturally curly hair and I was losing my curls to these unmanagable frizzes. I tried everything sold over the counter by every manufacturer.  A few months ago Redbook Magazine ran an article on the Best Beauty Buys available in 2013. Miss Jessie&#x27;s Super Soft Pillow Soft Curls was named The Best Curl Definer for Thick/Coarse Hair. I sent away for it and am so glad I did.It defined my naturally curly hair and manages the frizz at the same time!!! I don&#x27;t need any other product but Miss Jessie&#x27;s and look forward to trying your other products! Thank you Miss Jessie!!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. My curls are so soft and fluffy! I just need to use caution on the amount I use. If you put too much the curls look heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> Smells great, not enough hold, and leaves my hair a big frizzy POOF. Better off using eco styler gel. Waste of money.!!!</li>
            <li> I loved it !! my hair looks amazing but I had to give this product 4 stars because the smell is so sweet and strong it gave me a headache ...now am mixing it with another styling lotion I have and the smell it&#x27;s not that strong anymore....</li>
            <li> This tends to make my hair look dirty. I&#x27;ve tried it a few times, because I wanted to like it. Also, the scent is very sweet and strong.</li>
            <li> I gave this product a 5-star rating because it is the ONLY product I have ever used in my life (I&#x27;m 40) that actually makes my curly hair look and feel pillow soft! It&#x27;s amazing, and worth the price!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to anyone who has thick, frizzy, curly hair who wants curls that are big, soft, and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product!</li>
            <li> Love the scent and good product.</li>
            <li> I have color-treated wavy hair, and it seems to be always dry [&#x3D; frizzy]. I owned this product for a while, and my first take was that it was too heavy. I&#x27;ve started using it again, and I&#x27;ve changed my mind. Part of the change is due to my finally accepting all these wavy curls. My hair just drinks this stuff up, and the frizz is gone. I do have Pillow Soft Curls.</li>
            <li> I have 3a/3b curly frizzy hair. I finished my usual curl product that I was supremely happy with and should have ordered more... But instead I went I decided to experiment with other products... Big mistake! I tried the pillow curls and it just didn&#x27;t work for my hair. My hair usually has some big curls anyway but for some reason I got small tight curls in some areas and in others I just got a frizzy curl. It just didn&#x27;t work at all. But the smell is divine.... It does smell a bit like you laundry... Which I didn&#x27;t even think about until I read other reviews... But who doesn&#x27;t like the smell of fresh clean laundry?? Anyway, not great for me (I&#x27;ll stick with what works for me Camille rose) but the smell is awesome</li>
            <li> People ask how if or my amazing curls when I use this</li>
            <li> Ths is a little too light for my very fine curly wavy hair. It would probably work better on fine dry hair. My hair dresser loves it.</li>
            <li> This made my curls so soft.  It smells great, kind of like fabric softener...And it fought frizz. Would buy again!</li>
            <li> It looks weird and it&#x27;s a little expensive but it smells wonderful and helps keep my frizz in check, I have a lot of hair so I have to use more than what they recommend but it works better than frizzease.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after a recommendation from the sales clerk at Beans.  I was looking for a product that would define and hydrate my 3b-ish curls, without the stickiness and crunchiness I get from other products.  After one use, I must say I am impressed.  I co-washed (As I Am Coconut Co-wash), conditioned (Carol&#x27;s Daughter Black Vanilla), applied a leave-in (As I Am) and then applied the Miss Jessie&#x27;s.  I did a partial diffuse and air dried the rest of the way.  My curls were shiny, soft and defined, with a tiny, but acceptable amount of frizz.  This might be due to my application technique (I was rushed), so we&#x27;ll see how it goes next time.  I did notice a bit more shrinkage with using this product, probably because it is so light.  I am not crazy about the smell, however.  Other reviewers said it smells like fabric softener.  I would describe it as a blend of fabric softener, bug repellant and maybe some type of disinfectant?  Its not horrible, but it is overpowering and probably would not complement most perfumes or lotions.  The product is also very high-priced so I will probably keep looking for a similar more affordable option.  Still, this gets high ratings from me.</li>
            <li> Best products!! So worth the money!..</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift and it left a film on my hair and just didnt feel right, so i washed out immediately</li>

            <li> I felt like I was living in the laundry matt. I was dying to wash it out of my hair. I&#x27;m glad I received this as a full size for free because if I actually paid money for this I would be livid.  I believe this product is for a people with a coarser texture in hair.( my hair is a mix  3A\3B and  ) This made my hair heavy and it felt sticky as well. I tried twice while my air was wet one day and another while it as dry.  At best is might have reduced the frizz in my hair but other than that is product is T-RASH.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my SIL who has curly hair and she really loves it. She says it makes her curls soft and not crunchy like most curly hair products.</li>
            <li> This is possibly the best hair product I have ever owned. I was pretty surprised to learn that it wasn&#x27;t intended for my hair type in the first place, because it really gives me a better texture than anything else I have tried in my last 13 years of trying to fix curly hair &#x3D;).&lt;br /&gt;I am white and my hair is neither particularly thick nor thin, but it is an unruly type of curly/wavy. This makes it really soft and not greasy (I have that problem with a lot of other products).</li>
            <li> The smell is really strong. Wish they would make an unscented version.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful!  The smell is not bad at all, in fact it is quite nice.  Smells really good.  My boyfriend loves it!  He says it smells better than a lot of the regular products I use.  Don&#x27;t let the reviews drive you away, it really is a great product.  If it is overwelming to some, you may want to consider using less of the product.</li>
            <li> Perfect hair product for me! I have loose curls and this product keeps down the frizz and defines the curls without making them crunchy. I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> BUYER BEWARE!! I used this stuff for the last few months. It worked wonders on my curly hair. However in the cooler non humid months I straighten my hair. It has been THREE WEEKS. And I can not get this waxy disgusting residue out of my hair. I&#x27;ve tried everything. Different vinegars, different clarifying poos, baking soda, dawn dish soap, an $80 trip to the salon and I even SOAKED it in googone today. When I attempt to blow dry it my hair is dry, waxy, sticky tangly and dull. I can&#x27;t even comb my fingers through it. I&#x27;m convinced I have to cut a minimum of ten inches off my hair. I&#x27;m absolutely horrified. I&#x27;ve had long gorgeous hair my whole life. And now my last resort is to cut it into a freakin bob. I&#x27;m so so so so upset. Don&#x27;t EVER use this product.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and have tried every product you can think of. This product beats them all. Yes, it&#x27;s kind of pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it and it smells soooooo good!</li>
            <li> my hair is just too thick and corse for this product&lt;br /&gt;my sister has fine thin hair and she loves it</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like laundry detergent. The smell is really strong and not worth any &amp;#34;pillow soft curls&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I got Pillow Soft Curls from my local Target and used it for the first time today. I&#x27;m white, with 2C hair. This product defined my curls like nothing else I&#x27;ve tried... and I&#x27;ve tried A LOT of products. I let my hair air-dry and it ended up a little crunchy, but some quick scrunching took care of that. My hair gets curlier the longer it gets, and I&#x27;m growing out a pixie cut. The top layers are the hardest to curl and Pillow Soft Curls gave them enough definition that I didn&#x27;t feel the need to break out the curling wand to touch up those limp pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does have a strong smell that&#x27;s similar to fabric softener, but it&#x27;s not overwhelming. I made my husband sniff my head and he said it smelled like Downy, but not in a bad way. That&#x27;s high praise in man-words.</li>
            <li> According to naturallycurly.com my hair type is 3A characterized by &#x27;curly twirly&#x27; shaped curls. I also have SUPER thick strands and LOTS of them so when I use product, I usually run out pretty quickly. I purchased Pillow Soft Curls almost 2 months ago and at first I was disappointed because the price was so high for something that didn&#x27;t seem to work when air drying (which is what the directions recommend.) So I continued to use it and returned to my usual method of putting product in after the shower and braiding my hair into about 15 different braids to dry overnight. I do this 2 times a week (on rare occasions I wash 3 times a week, I&#x27;m not a very active or outdoorsy person) and with this product I have touchable soft curls and very little frizz, though the lack of frizz is likely from the braids. So, 2 times a week for almost 2 months and I still have half a bottle left which means this product has lasted much longer than others (and is therefore worth the price to me) and my curls are soft, not crunchy. I have no problem with the smell, at first it was strong but now I have gotten used to it. My only complaint is that it does nothing for shine, so I rub hair oil or spritz a shine spray once my hair is dry. So, I would definitely recommend this to 3A curly&#x27;s, but I can&#x27;t say anything for the other hair types.</li>
            <li> Works fairly well - it seems a little heavy if you use too much and the scent is VERY STRONG of laundry soap/softener. It takes a little trial and error to figure out just how much you need for your hair type, but after that it works well, but seems a little pricey.</li>
            <li> This product is just OK.  I have type 3 curly thick blonde hair and bought this to see if I could get a bit more volume with a lighter cream product.  Fist you&#x27;ll notice that it smells like fabric softner, which isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing, but doesn&#x27;t go away with time.  It does offer a loser curl, softer curl (no crunchy curls here) but there are other product on the market that work as well and aren&#x27;t as expensive.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying a 2nd bottle.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine naturally curly hair that if I put too much stuff in, it looks stringy and crazy but if I don&#x27;t put anything then I&#x27;m super frizzy with 3 different textures on my head.  The product has a nice creamy texture and I love the smell - sure it&#x27;s like fabric softener but I love the smell of clean laundry so that doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I have found the most success using this on very wet hair, a little goes a long way and when I don&#x27;t diffuse.  Diffuse is okay but it takes longer with this product then when I use a mousse or something lighter.  All in all, the product does what it says it does and I will definitely keep it in my hair rotation.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair so soft.  I used it on Wednesday, and it lasted until Sunday morning.  Please note that I was pineappling my hair at night, and I exercised three times (intense cardio!).  In the morning, I used a bit of oil and fluffed my hair.  I got compliments on my hair.  I really really love this product.  It may not have the best ingredients but somehow it works on my hair.</li>
            <li> This did not really do much for my hair. I have a suave product that is half the price and works much better. I was hoping for a great product to enhance my wavy hair but it didn&#x27;t. I will be sticking with my much cheaper Suave from now on. Kind of a sad waste of money.</li>
            <li> The only hair product I&#x27;ve found that makes my curls soft, defined, and cute without frizz. Plus the smell is amazing and clean!</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty curly but the way this defines adds softness and shine and bounce is incredible. I would recommend this to someone with wavy hair to give extra curl.</li>
            <li> This is totally awesome, and it sounds great, definitely get it....</li>
            <li> As a caucasian woman with naturally curly hair, after 40 years I finally got tired of fighting my natural texture and decided to work with it.  This is the best product I have found for my hair when I want to leave it curly.  My hair is very fine, curly in some places and more crimped-looking in others.  Pillow Soft Curls, when applied in generous amounts to very wet hair, results in soft, non-frizzy curls that don&#x27;t look like a bad perm.  I let my hair air-dry as much as possible and only use a blowdryer/diffuser if really pressed for time.  I actually like the fragrance, it isn&#x27;t strong and doesn&#x27;t seem to clash with perfume.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Amazing item...i&#x27; m loving it!!!</li>
            <li> First off, I am just now realizing this is a product designed for African-American hair. But I am caucasian with curly hair, similar to Sarah Jessica Parker early-SATC (I&#x27;ll try to post a picture above).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anywho, I got a sample in a birchbox and tried it out. I use a big ol&#x27; gob of it after I wash and put leave-in conditioner. It&#x27;s really amazing!! It kicks any gel, cream, or mousse&#x27;s butt (my last fav was Bed Head Curls Rock and this is 10 x&#x27;s better).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to agree about the smell. I am so NOT a fan of it. It reminds me of an old lady going to church. My DH doesn&#x27;t like it either - so much so that he&#x27;s commented on it several times. But since I only wash my hair 2-3 times a week, I&#x27;m willing to live with it those few days and not deduct any stars (I would take off a half star if I could). Miss Jessie, consider a better fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really love this product and encourage ANY person with curly hair to try it.</li>
            <li> Not at all what it claims to do waist of too much money</li>
            <li> It softens the hair, but smells like fabric softener and leaves a residue/film on the hair.</li>
            <li> I have wavy unruly hair and this is the only product to date in my 51 years that has tamed my hair and made me love having wavy hair!  I love it!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this product cuz it would cut out maybe a hour in the styling of my hair. I have a mixture of 4a &amp; 4c hair type,  I usually have to twist or flattwist my hair with product to get define curls, the Miss Jessie&#x27;s Curling Pudding worked best for me. My curls are small coil like a spring in a pen, this particular product suggested that it would give you big curls instead of the ramen noodle tiny curls. Well not true, my tiny curls stayed tiny. My curls don&#x27;t look as cute as they do when i do flattwists or just regular twist. I get major shrinkage when i wash my hair and it stays like that for about 3 days b4 it starts to fall and stretch which is why i like doing flattwist. I gave 3 stars cuz It does smell good like fabric softener and it makes your hair soft. If u have tiny curls like mine and short  hair definitely not the product 4 u unless u use another product and twist ur hair. I would recommend using a moisturizing creme like miss jessie&#x27;s buttercreme cuz this product does not moisture your hair. If u have long natural hair with tiny curls this may work as a quick wash n go cuz it does serve as a curl activator but my hair is short. Im gonna have to wear a scarf or band to work tomorrow then wet &amp; twist my hair tomorrow nite with curling pudding</li>
            <li> This one I love I can mist my hair with water and apply this and my curls are defined and soft</li>
            <li> I have used Bumble and Bumble, Moroccan Oil and just about every other curl cream. This is the best, hands down. Sets quickly, not too hard, washes out easily. And about $10 less than the others.</li>
            <li> I got this in my Birchbox box last year and I LOVE it. I am white, 67 years old with dyed (red) naturally curly hair. Have not been able to have medium length hair FOR YEARS because it turns to frizz, and I have tried gazillions of non-frizz and other products, most of them expensive and high end. I truly could not believe this- it just makes big fat loopy curls and they last for two or three days before my hair starts frizzing again. Yeah, it looks weird (aqua blue)and it smells like fabric softener, but the smell disappears very quickly. Just don&#x27;t put too much on (about the size of a quarter, and maybe 1/4 inch thick, or the size of a nickel about 1/2 thick.)I have tried other Miss Jessie products after discovering this, but this is the only that works for me, and does it ever.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves the smell of this</li>
            <li> I have tried almost literally every de-frizz, curl shaping, hair managing product possible.  I read a positive review from a bi-racial reviewer on this product and decided to try.  I have very thick, long, curly, and more than anything, frizzy hair.  I have latin hair and most everyday curl, de-frizz products aren&#x27;t strong enough to manage the hair.  Or they make my hair hard and crunchy then don&#x27;t last long.  And many african american hair products are very heavy and make my hair loose its bounce and movement.  This product is just in the middle for me.  It&#x27;s not crunchy At ALL and keeps my curls in line with no frizz AND I don&#x27;t have to use half the bottle on my lower back lengthed hair like most products.  I love this product, am soooo thrilled that I finally found something that works!</li>
            <li> What do you know... it turns out my hair is CURLY, not just a frizzy mess. This product defines my curls and weighs down the flyaways enough that my hair actually looks good. For the first time in fifteen years, I&#x27;m not hiding it in a ponytail by the end of every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got a fairly strong scent, but I like it. And it&#x27;s also a little too heavy to use every single day on my hair (a ton of long, very fine hair with loose curls)... but I alternate it every other day with a different frizz tamer, and the combo seems to be working. I don&#x27;t hate my hair anymore!</li>
            <li> love it and love the smell!!</li>
            <li> Best hair cream I&#x27;ve ever used! Tamed my crazy curls!</li>
            <li> I love the way this product makes my hair look and feel, however, there is definitely a flake factor (as others have mentioned). It has caused me to wash my hair more frequently that I probably should, which with thick curly hair, you know can be an issue as well. I say try it, but use sparingly. As far as the smell, it doesn&#x27;t bother me. I don&#x27;t really notice it once my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> I sampled this product &amp; fell in love. A quarter sized amount keeps my curly/ wavy hair beautiful all day. My hair is touchable &amp; smells like a dry sheet.</li>
            <li> I have not used this on wet hair yet as recommended on label. I have 4a/b hair some 4c at the crown. Natural hair.  I used to do wash and go&#x27;s for the most part but the detangling was a production on wash days and I was losing a lot of hair because of the tangles and knots. I had ordered the Miss Jesse&#x27;s pillow soft curls but it just sat in my drawer because I had already decided to give the wash and go&#x27;s a rest. So I&#x27;ve been blow drying and sometimes flat ironing my hair to keep it detangled. But I really wanted to use the PSC because of the fragrance. I&#x27;m tired of smelling like coconut and pinapples and such. Closer to wash day, I&#x27;ve been wetting my hair a little around the edges, smearing the Pillow Soft Curls in my hands, rubbing this, then ecostyler gel, brushing into a bun, tying my hair down for the night and the next day, shiny, laid edges and hair with waves. Not stiff at all! So, I may try the wash and go one day with this stuff. It seems like it would be a good detangler if for nothing else. Is it fabric softener? Plus, the smell...I love the scent. Plus I found Airwick Snuggle Fresh Linen wax melts for my scentsy warmers. So I smell like snuggle from head to toe and my house does too.</li>
            <li> Not Really what I expected 😏</li>
            <li> I love this cream. I&#x27;ve never been able to wear my hear naturally curly because it would be too frizzy, and not defined. This is the first cream I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t look scrunchy or and it maeks my entire hair less frizzy so my baby hairs stay smooth and the top of the hair becomes smooth while the bottom is curly and has volume. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments. I love this cream.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  My second tube.</li>
            <li> Best curl product I&#x27;ve used , I have a long hair and my curls looked so natural and beautiful ..</li>
            <li> Love this product! And it smells so good! My hair is very wild and frizzy curly and this product allows me to wear my hair down without Barrett&#x27;s or hair ties!</li>
            <li> I have tried probably a hundred different products, both expensive as well as inexpensive and this is by far my favorite. I&#x27;m Caucasian with type 3b curly hair and every other cream seems to weigh down my hair too much, especially at the roots since my hair is mid back. I would constantly wear my hair up before this product, but now it looks pretty fabulous letting it do its thing if I do say so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave it only 4 stars is because the fragrance is very overwhelming, but I still use the heck out of the product anyway. I just smell really clean all the time I guess. As a tip, don&#x27;t use too much of the stuff or it will make your hair look a little dull and feel a bit weird. You have to experiment with the amount but it works wonders once you get it down.</li>
            <li> Love love LOVE this product. I have crazy curly hair. It tames my curls and makes them so soft!!  The scent takes a  little getting used to, it smells like fabric softener. Which in my opinion is a tad over bearing, but with that being said..  How well the product works and for the price point you get over it. At least I do.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. Smells and works great!! Already recommended this to a friend!! This product is more of a liquid than I expected but it works better that way because it looks natural!! So glad I found this product!!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;ve never had such pretty, well defined curls until this product.  It makes my curls big and fat...that last and last.  Finally, I can go to sleep and wake up with curls still.  All I do to revive my whole look is to dampen my hair, put a little leave in conditioner, and finally pillow soft, run my fingers thru my hair, and I&#x27;m off.  I have fluffy, big, curls that are soft and shiny.  At long last, my search is over!  I&#x27;ve found products I&#x27;m totally happy, and my cabinet thanks me.  I recommend!!</li>
            <li> As someone who has dealt with her stubborn, curly hair her whole life, this product is the real deal. Don&#x27;t be assuaged by the price as I first was. I have thick hair and a little goes a long way here. I use about two squirts and my hair is pretty much covered and my curls really haven&#x27;t even looked better. So  recommend.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff alot because it does not leave your hair crunchy. Just curls that are loose and soft. It does NOT have a strong smell like some of the reviews said, I found the smell to be clean and nice. It&#x27;s hard to explain the consistency of the product, it is not gel or mousse, it is more of a mixture of a runny lotion, it does not make your hands sticky and you only need about a table spoon for long hair. (My hair goes to the middle of my back) It comes in a decent sized bottle and since you only need a minimal amount it lasts quite a while. You put it on towel dried, combed hair and then cruch and twirl your hair to encourage the curls. I barely crunched as I put it on and had decently curly hair. It looked wet for about an hour and after that it was just plain curly. Definitely a good product if you dont like the look of gelled, hair sprayed curls!</li>
            <li> Great product, I love it. I am glad to finally have found something that actually works.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would love to try samples of their other products</li>
            <li> This is amazing.  A friend of mine at work told me about this and so I ordered it.  I LOVE IT!  Smells fresh and wonderful and does amazing things to your hair.  You can go curly or blow dry and it works great either way.  I strongly recommend it.</li>
