    <ol>
            <li>Wonderful and arrived on time!  </li>
            <li>The produce is excellent!  </li>
            <li>This product worked great!</li>
            <li>It is a great product, I was scared of getting my lips pinched, but no worries here, there is no lip pinching!!</li>
            <li>Excellent price.  </li>
            <li>When I bought this it did not have the best reviews</li>
            <li>I find it&#x27;s great to use when I&#x27;m working on the computer.</li>
            <li>I however did buy it and have not been happy with its performance.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>But as I said after using this one and seeing results I&#x27;m considering spending more money for the brand upgrade!</li>
            <li>Nice company.</li>
            <li>and she liked it.</li>
            <li>It would have been better if I made my own.  </li>
            <li>Satisfied...</li>
            <li>Arrived in the time frame as stated, it&#x27;s definitely interesting..</li>
            <li>so I went online and was able to watch a video on the product by another buyer and see how to use it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not for sure about this product.</li>
            <li>I thought it is good at first.</li>
            <li>Well, for what I paid the quality was pretty darn good.</li>
            <li>It does give my mouth a good workout, but I wish the direction were in English and how often or many times a day I should do it, but I&#x27;m sure I can find it online</li>
            <li>Cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made.</li>
            <li>It is cheaply made and I would recommend using it 2 to 3 times a day</li>
            <li>I knew it was cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>cheap plastic</li>
            <li>I tore them apart and modified the insides and the cut the spring to 2/3 its original length.</li>
            <li>Okay I just got mine in today, I ordered this exact one, but from ebay because it was about 3 bucks cheaper than amazon.  </li>
            <li>So true.</li>
            <li>and it is pretty strong.</li>
            <li>Noticed hollow of cheeks better, but need more time!</li>
            <li>Smile, smile, smile, smile give more smile mouth is improved.</li>
            <li>I gave it 3 stars because it arrived quickly without damage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say start out with this one first because it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>The previous ones worked great, even if you have to toss them after a month or two ( metal spring starts to erode and them rust sets it).</li>
            <li>This works really well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>My smile got a tad wider (which what I wanted)</li>
            <li>I think it is worth it</li>
            <li>Hey think of it this way you exercise your body to be healthy and to look young</li>
            <li>Arrived very slowly but in excellent condition; however, this product came apart right when I opened the package.  </li>
            <li>this is a joke right?  </li>
            <li>I cant even believe that this actually works 100% for me in fact I get great compliments daily</li>
            <li>I believe it is working and am also thinking of investing in the higher priced model.  </li>
            <li>I put it back together many times</li>
            <li>I bought it to tighten my face instead and it did just that after the first time.  </li>
            <li>It broke the first time I used it</li>
            <li>but it does exactly what it says and</li>
            <li>You can really feel it working, it has the right pressure.  </li>
            <li>So far so good it didnt break like ive read in other reviews</li>
            <li>If this was made a little better, it would be a great little tool for exercising your face!  </li>
            <li>A nice little gadget for the price.  </li>
            <li>This is a real review.</li>
            <li>It is not made very well</li>
            <li>Cheaply made, only tried it once</li>
            <li>Honestly the only draw back it takes quite a while to get here</li>
            <li>I would have rather spent a little bit more for one that was more reliable.</li>
            <li>I thought this was at first a great product that might actually work, however every reviwe before stated that it was no good</li>
            <li>This is a good product and sure beats the expensive surgery which would be needed to get the same results.  </li>
            <li>and I am surprised I got it so fast, as it was shipped from Hong Kong!</li>
            <li>Be sure to put a little vaseline in the corners of your mouth when using as this can become a tender area after 150 squeezes.  </li>
            <li>I was abit skeptic at first because it is just a little piece of plastic and has nothing special to it</li>
            <li>Even a new design at this point would not change the fact that it will not work and has not not worked ever</li>
            <li>I had a product that was the exact same design as this.</li>
            <li>(To be clear this is Brian&#x27;s girlfriend we share the account.)</li>
            <li>It is completely plastic</li>
            <li>This is my second one in 2 years, it really did work for me</li>
            <li>My sister noticed a considerable difference in my face and the jawls.  </li>
            <li>It also makes a somewhat loud noise when the spring inside contracts and releases.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to try this cheap version to see if it exercised mouth before actually spending money on a long lasting one.  </li>
            <li>It really worked my facial muscles in this area and made the smile lines less that day as my muscles underneath plumped up.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, cheap with the same results as the expensive one</li>
            <li>I agree with another reviewer that said it was a cheap piece of plastic with very little tension.  </li>
            <li>It does the job (barely), but I&#x27;d rather just get a decent one for an extra twenty-five bucks.</li>
            <li>thought it would work properly but, the spring in the device gets struk and also hurts your mouth, the plastic is not finished proprerly which may hurt ur sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So I been using it though I had to smooth out the space that you put you side of the mouth in because some plastic was a little sharp.  </li>

            <li> I am usually sketical about these types of products but this device really works.  </li>
            <li> There were no instructions in English on on how to use it and for how long.</li>
            <li> SO SO LONG TO GET TO ME, THEN THE INSTRUCTIONS WERE NOT IN ENGLISH, AND</li>
            <li> this product broken the very first day i used it</li>
            <li> It does not fit any adult mouth.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes your lip might rub on it and hurt if you do it too long.</li>
            <li> dealer have me half price credit back  </li>
            <li> Pointless and could read proper directions because there wasn&#x27;t an english translation!!!</li>
            <li> Spring not strong enough.</li>
            <li> However it took a fairly long time (which is to be expected it&#x27;s coming from out of the country) and it took me a few tries to figure out how to use it no English and the picture examples were not detailed.</li>
            <li> Not worth a $1.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s completely not worth it</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> but this is a bad product and it needs a new concept completely and design as well.</li>
            <li> sorry to saidit has been broken easily</li>
            <li> The weird thing is if you use it for too long, you&#x27;ll drool a little while at the same time your mouth will dry.</li>
            <li> I bought three of these from this company as the previous company is gone.</li>
            <li> I push it in a little while I&#x27;m doing it because it can get stuck, but if you put a little coconut or any-kind of oil it loosens it up.</li>
            <li> So it is not good for long term use.</li>
            <li> This item came open and broken.</li>
            <li> I need exercise my mouth everyday.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I beg of all that reads this don&#x27;t waste your money as I would never write a maybe statement to mislead anyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small price for a little vanity.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure but it won&#x27;t stop me from seeing if it will.</li>
            <li> it was too small for my mouth .  </li>
            <li> but I was at least able to use it but was very  disappointed in every way.</li>
            <li> These are not very good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to use it for long periods because it might break and your jaw starts hurting after a few reps.</li>
            <li> do at least 20 reps each time.</li>
            <li> Tried it a few times - was afraid I&#x27;d choke on the small piece.  </li>
            <li> poor quality, pass on this&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> One side was broken when received.  </li>
            <li> Not happy</li>
            <li> this thing was broken b4</li>
            <li> either it so helps my self esteem  when people stop me and say work on earth are you doing or what have you had done MY SECRET</li>
            <li> horrible, don&#x27;t buy this particular one.</li>
            <li> but I urge you to believe that this is a proven fact that this is no good and is completely useless and it will be like throwing your money away</li>
            <li> Crap don&#x27;t waste ur money</li>
            <li> WTF?  </li>
            <li> My issue with it is that its useless.</li>
            <li> it a fake type of plastic they use to make this</li>
            <li> It is nor merely an opinion</li>
            <li> So sorry to the seller</li>
            <li> The friction on it is so bad I had to use it backwards for it to work.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use it cant figure it out very uncomfortable stupid piece of equipment</li>
            <li> I was am so disappointed with this.</li>

    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I had a product that was the exact same design as this. The previous ones worked great, even if you have to toss them after a month or two ( metal spring starts to erode and them rust sets it). I bought three of these from this company as the previous company is gone. These are not very good. The spring is too string, the plastic binds. I tore them apart and modified the insides and the cut the spring to 2/3 its original length. That helped some. So for this I have to say &amp;#34; poor quality, pass on this&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic. Junk. Not worth a $1.</li>
            <li> This works really well and is easy to use. I use it after I brush my teeth, while I&#x27;m styling my hair.</li>
            <li> There were no instructions in English on on how to use it and for how long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small price for a little vanity.  Don&#x27;t see that it can hurt.  Nice company.</li>
            <li> Wonderful and arrived on time!  The produce is excellent!  Satisfied...</li>
            <li> A nice little gadget for the price.  I believe it is working and am also thinking of investing in the higher priced model.  I find it&#x27;s great to use when I&#x27;m working on the computer.</li>
            <li> It works I guess... My smile got a tad wider (which what I wanted), My face did not get any slimmer ( I think). It is completely plastic but it didn&#x27;t hurt my lips, it didn&#x27;t break or anything and it is pretty strong.</li>
            <li> This product worked great! And after hours of use a day I saw results in two weeks!!!</li>
            <li> The worst piece of junk I purchased.  One side was broken when received.  It would have been better if I made my own.  I guess you pay for what you get.</li>
            <li> My mouth is too big for this...</li>
            <li> Arrived in the time frame as stated, it&#x27;s definitely interesting.. Will it work? I&#x27;m not sure but it won&#x27;t stop me from seeing if it will. Makes my face hurt after a while.</li>
            <li> Good product. I don&#x27;t use it every day but I can feel the facial work out, so it has to be doing something.</li>
            <li> it was too small for my mouth .  dealer have me half price credit back  It does not fit any adult mouth.  It should not be on the market.....</li>
            <li> I GUESS YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. I TOTALLY FORGOT I ORDERED IT SINCE IT TOOK SO SO LONG TO GET TO ME, THEN THE INSTRUCTIONS WERE NOT IN ENGLISH, AND SOON AS I OPEN IT, IT BROKE. IT IS LITERALLY A PIECE OF PLASTIC. DO NOT BUY, YOU ARE WASTING YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li> Pointless and could read proper directions because there wasn&#x27;t an english translation!!!</li>
            <li> When I washed it off it fell apart.  I put it back together many times so it works.</li>
            <li> This is my second one in 2 years, it really did work for me I was abit skeptic at first because it is just a little piece of plastic and has nothing special to it but it works just do it 15-20 mins a day and after a week or two you will start getting compliments that your losing weight and look slimmer!</li>
            <li> Crap don&#x27;t waste ur money</li>
            <li> This item came open and broken. Not happy</li>
            <li> WTF?  this is a joke right?  It doesn&#x27;t do anything for any part of your face.</li>
            <li> Oh no it is not what expected as it has no tension on it, after one use the item broke in two it just open up and cannot be fixed back so i have lost my money</li>
            <li> I occasionally used it. I need exercise my mouth everyday. Smile, smile, smile, smile give more smile mouth is improved.</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because it arrived quickly without damage. My issue with it is that its useless.</li>
            <li> I am usually sketical about these types of products but this device really works.  My sister noticed a considerable difference in my face and the jawls.  This is a good product and sure beats the expensive surgery which would be needed to get the same results.  I used it for 5 minutes a day and saw results in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I feel like it&#x27;s gonna break. Cheaply made. But you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> Just got it and I am surprised I got it so fast, as it was shipped from Hong Kong! Took only about 2 weeks compared to a month! It is a great product, I was scared of getting my lips pinched, but no worries here, there is no lip pinching!!</li>
            <li> this thing was broken b4 i even received it...horrible, don&#x27;t buy this particular one. it a fake type of plastic they use to make this</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money it&#x27;s completely not worth it</li>
            <li> I was am so disappointed with this. I wasted my money. It was broke when I got it.</li>
            <li> So far so good it didnt break like ive read in other reviews and ive use it for a week and i have seen results if using it correctly it does work.</li>
            <li> Noticed hollow of cheeks better, but need more time!</li>
            <li> This product is designed to help slim the face.  I bought it to tighten my face instead and it did just that after the first time.  It really worked my facial muscles in this area and made the smile lines less that day as my muscles underneath plumped up.  My lower cheek tissue is even firmer to the touch. You can really feel it working, it has the right pressure.  Be sure to put a little vaseline in the corners of your mouth when using as this can become a tender area after 150 squeezes.  Excellent price.  Is a bit noisy with a click click as you work it.</li>
            <li> (To be clear this is Brian&#x27;s girlfriend we share the account.) considering the product is under two dollars I think it is worth it, I do feel the strain on my muscles after about five to ten minutes. However it took a fairly long time (which is to be expected it&#x27;s coming from out of the country) and it took me a few tries to figure out how to use it no English and the picture examples were not detailed.</li>
            <li> It broke the first time I used it</li>
            <li> It does make you work your mouth.</li>
            <li> I bought this from China to test it out so that I can buy the more expensive one later. This tool actually works for what it&#x27;s suppose to do, my face looks firmer after using it a week. It is cheaply made and I would recommend using it 2 to 3 times a day do at least 20 reps each time. I&#x27;m afraid to use it for long periods because it might break and your jaw starts hurting after a few reps. Sometimes your lip might rub on it and hurt if you do it too long. But as I said after using this one and seeing results I&#x27;m considering spending more money for the brand upgrade! Hey think of it this way you exercise your body to be healthy and to look young so it only makes sense to exercise your face muscles to lift them up.</li>
            <li> I just received it in the mail.  I&#x27;m very disappointed.  I agree with another reviewer that said it was a cheap piece of plastic with very little tension.  So true.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use it cant figure it out very uncomfortable stupid piece of equipment</li>
            <li> From the moment I got it I knew it was cheap plastic. The friction on it is so bad I had to use it backwards for it to work. It does the job (barely), but I&#x27;d rather just get a decent one for an extra twenty-five bucks.</li>
            <li> Pinches my lip. Spring not strong enough.</li>
            <li> cheap plastic does the job hardly.i thought it would work properly but, the spring in the device gets struk and also hurts your mouth, the plastic is not finished proprerly which may hurt ur sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I thought it is good at first. However, as I use again and again, the metal part got rusted. So it is not good for long term use. If you want to keep using this, you have to buy manyof them.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, cheap with the same results as the expensive one</li>
            <li> Okay I just got mine in today, I ordered this exact one, but from ebay because it was about 3 bucks cheaper than amazon.  So I been using it though I had to smooth out the space that you put you side of the mouth in because some plastic was a little sharp.  I wanted to try this cheap version to see if it exercised mouth before actually spending money on a long lasting one.  I push it in a little while I&#x27;m doing it because it can get stuck, but if you put a little coconut or any-kind of oil it loosens it up. It does give my mouth a good workout, but I wish the direction were in English and how often or many times a day I should do it, but I&#x27;m sure I can find it online some where.  So if you want to test drive this facial exercise I&#x27;d say start out with this one first because it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> It does its job rather well. I can feel my face tighten after a week. The weird thing is if you use it for too long, you&#x27;ll drool a little while at the same time your mouth will dry.</li>
            <li> Honestly the only draw back it takes quite a while to get here but it does exactly what it says and then some HITS set up 3workouts aday 20reps at a time man my face is so slim I cant even believe that this actually works 100% for me in fact I get great compliments daily and im never gonna stop working my muscles I n my mouth either it so helps my self esteem  when people stop me and say work on earth are you doing or what have you had done MY SECRET but I end up telling them so they can get one... I LOVEM(NE</li>
            <li> I thought this was at first a great product that might actually work, however every reviwe before stated that it was no good and I still gave it a try. This product did absoulty nothing and it hurt in my mouth after a very short tim e. Even as everyone has stated before the instructions are in Chinese and unreadable so I went online and was able to watch a video on the product by another buyer and see how to use it and they still hated it too but I was at least able to use it but was very  disappointed in every way. Please save your money it will do nothing and you will use it maybe once, twice, and even maybe three times and then never again. I beg of all that reads this don&#x27;t waste your money as I would never write a maybe statement to mislead anyone. It is nor merely an opinion but I urge you to believe that this is a proven fact that this is no good and is completely useless and it will be like throwing your money away s please look elsewhere. So sorry to the seller but this is a bad product and it needs a new concept completely and design as well. Even a new design at this point would not change the fact that it will not work and has not not worked ever</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not for sure about this product. I can&#x27;t read the directions they are in japanese</li>
            <li> Well, for what I paid the quality was pretty darn good. The concept is based on a simple muscle exercise. I bought it for my mom and she liked it. It helps to tighten your facial muscles. This is a real review.</li>
            <li> If this was made a little better, it would be a great little tool for exercising your face!  It does help tone and shape your mouth.</li>
            <li> It broke and I could not use it</li>
            <li> this product broken the very first day i used it</li>
            <li> I have not seen the difference yet, but I trust it will work. I know it takes time. I like it</li>
            <li> Arrived very slowly but in excellent condition; however, this product came apart right when I opened the package.  Tried it a few times - was afraid I&#x27;d choke on the small piece.  Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> When I bought this it did not have the best reviews and I should have left it at that.  I however did buy it and have not been happy with its performance.  It is not made very well and it tends to get stuck after a while.  As a result I find myself using my fingers to help it close which defeats the purpose of building the face muscles.  It also makes a somewhat loud noise when the spring inside contracts and releases.  I would have rather spent a little bit more for one that was more reliable.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made, only tried it once and it was pinching the skin around my mouth. I gave up.</li>
            <li> sorry to saidit has been broken easily</li>
