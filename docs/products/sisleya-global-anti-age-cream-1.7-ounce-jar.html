            <li>I attribute my wonderful skin to this product so use it daily.  </li>
            <li>If you go to a Sisley rep, you will be told more information than you&#x27;d ever want about the products in each and every item.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Pricing much better than dept stores.  </li>
            <li>Love love love this product  </li>
            <li>This has been my favorite face cream for years.  </li>
            <li>Nothing else seems to match it, since I&#x27;m allergic to most products.</li>
            <li>More use, the skin ,more radiant ....</li>
            <li>Best facial creme ever.</li>
            <li>I love the moisturizing products that moisturize without greasiness.</li>
            <li>My skin looks glowing and brighter and my make up even looks better, when applied after using this cream.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite face cream.</li>
            <li>I find that very strange as I know for a fact, Sisley makes the best creams money can buy.&lt;br /&gt;In retrospect, wondering if this was a fake.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>This is great stuff for my 44 year old skin!</li>
            <li>Is more CHEAP IN AMAZON if you buy  at shop</li>
            <li>This is, hands down, the best anti-age face cream I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>If you can afford this cream, great, but it is for me simply overpriced.</li>
            <li>Sisley is a top-rate company that does disclose precisely what is in their products.</li>
            <li>The product was not in its original package.</li>
            <li>I expect a cream of this quality and price to be in its original package, as described, by the seller.</li>
            <li>It is pricey but worth every penny of it!</li>
            <li>Now I found the right place!</li>
            <li>I also love Dr. Hauschka and Elizabeth Arden, so while you may have to have a couple of different creams, you could achieve better results.</li>
            <li>I also add the Avon Genetics eye cream and serum and WOW have this way so much better results.</li>
            <li>Worth the price to me.</li>
            <li>Pricey, but worth every cent.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Importantly, unlike many high priced/designer inspired facial creams, this one really delivered.</li>
            <li>I have better results with the Avon Ultimate cream.</li>
            <li>IF you have a reaction, a reputable dealer will take the product back even if you don&#x27;t have a receipt.</li>
            <li>First it is your day and night cream that is used on the throat as well as face, Sisley has and continues to be a pioneer in using botanicals of the highest grade cultivated by this company.</li>
            <li>It makes it look pretty and supple.</li>
            <li>Is something expensive but dont worry when you used you are very happy.</li>
            <li>I have tried many brands and this is the one I always go back to.  </li>
            <li>It helps to combat wrinkles, moisturizes really well and makes the skin elastic.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>So in other words I found my cheaper creams working better, esp.</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon is very fair and in the long run you need a very small amount to moisturize, nourish and optimize the skins ability to aid in wrinkle softening and prevention, firming and again supremely moisturizing, my jar lasts me about 5-6 months</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>and it was new in container.</li>
            <li>I have been using it on and off (mostly on ) for the past 8 years.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have had no reactions.</li>
            <li>My wife has been using this product for years and there just is no other product like it!  </li>
            <li>I then went back to my usual routine and found it better working for a much lower price; this costs $ 300 and is not worth it.</li>
            <li>VERY expensive, shop around for a better price, it is worth it.</li>
            <li>This is anti-age cream is moisturizing and firming, has a delicate clean smell (not obtrusive).  </li>
            <li>I only order Sisley products directly from ONLY Amazon.</li>
            <li>Heals my dry skin in the winter and keeps my oily skin clear in the summer.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The cream was really nice I could see a difference in my skin</li>
            <li> Made me break out.  I find that very strange as I know for a fact, Sisley makes the best creams money can buy.&lt;br /&gt;In retrospect, wondering if this was a fake.&lt;br /&gt;Will not repurchase anything else from this vendor (Fragrancenet).</li>
            <li> I have known this product for decades, and it is def. a great cream. It helps to combat wrinkles, moisturizes really well and makes the skin elastic. However, I have used ONLY this cream for weeks and all the sudden wrinkles started showing up. I then went back to my usual routine and found it better working for a much lower price; this costs $ 300 and is not worth it. I have better results with the Avon Ultimate cream. I also add the Avon Genetics eye cream and serum and WOW have this way so much better results. So in other words I found my cheaper creams working better, esp. when I combine them. I also love Dr. Hauschka and Elizabeth Arden, so while you may have to have a couple of different creams, you could achieve better results. If you can afford this cream, great, but it is for me simply overpriced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sisleya for many years and just wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  I attribute my wonderful skin to this product so use it daily.  It&#x27;s worth every expensive penny.</li>
            <li> Sisley has great product, this is another good one.</li>
            <li> Sisley is a top-rate company that does disclose precisely what is in their products. Why your order did not have this information, I have no idea. Did you ask the store you purchased it from? If you go to a Sisley rep, you will be told more information than you&#x27;d ever want about the products in each and every item. Maybe be careful who you order from if you are not happy with the product. I only order Sisley products directly from ONLY Amazon. Otherwise I buy the products at Saks or Sisley online. Where, yes, you will be told every ingredient that is in whatever item you ask about. Sorry your experience was bad. Why didn&#x27;t you ask about the ingredients?  I think Sisley is fabulous---best skin care I have found. Worth the price to me. It WORKS. I have sensitive skin and have had no reactions. Others might, but I have not. IF you have a reaction, a reputable dealer will take the product back even if you don&#x27;t have a receipt. Sisley stands behind their product. Nothing synthetic.</li>
            <li> Very nice product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years.</li>
            <li> I will add to the pantheon of great reviews, this cream is marvelous for so many reasons. First it is your day and night cream that is used on the throat as well as face, Sisley has and continues to be a pioneer in using botanicals of the highest grade cultivated by this company. The price on Amazon is very fair and in the long run you need a very small amount to moisturize, nourish and optimize the skins ability to aid in wrinkle softening and prevention, firming and again supremely moisturizing, my jar lasts me about 5-6 months and I also use the Sisleya for eyes. I will also add that I am faithful user of serums and one of which can be found on Amazon , it is the wrinkle remover by Y&amp;H for $22 which contains DMAE, alpha lipoic acid and vitamin C.</li>
            <li> I love this product. what i got sure seems legit (some others had doubts on whether or not products were real or fake).  Pricing much better than dept stores.  leave skin looking refreshed. my skin is noticably &amp;#34;tire&amp;#34; looking w/o it. have been using this moisturizer about 2 years.  recommended.</li>
            <li> Pricey, but worth every cent. I got both the anti age cream as well as the eye/mouth cream and a good combined package price. Importantly, unlike many high priced/designer inspired facial creams, this one really delivered.</li>
            <li> Very good, super special...a  anti-age cream incredible.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to use all night before to sleep and you&#x27;ll see the result.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product  plus I saved 50% over Neiman Marcus</li>
            <li> Have used this wonderful product for a number of years but never purchased it before from Amazon; great price.</li>
            <li> Good stuff!  (and a lot less expensive than as sold through Neiman Marcus)  Tried it a few years ago, but  had to stop because it was so expensive.  Now I found the right place!</li>
            <li> This is great stuff for my 44 year old skin! It makes it look pretty and supple. I would recommend. Great shipping and it was new in container.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this product for years and there just is no other product like it!  Everybody askes her how she keeps her skin so &amp;#34;young&amp;#34; looking.</li>
            <li> This is the best skin cream I&#x27;ve ever used and I would highly recommend it.  I will be back for another jar.</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite face cream for years.  Nothing else seems to match it, since I&#x27;m allergic to most products.</li>
            <li> This is the best cream that I used.When yo begin no stop. Is Perfect. More use, the skin ,more radiant .... no is oily ; is nutritiv....Is something expensive but dont worry when you used you are very happy. Is more CHEAP IN AMAZON if you buy  at shop</li>
            <li> Best facial creme ever. Heals my dry skin in the winter and keeps my oily skin clear in the summer. Does not make my skin break out. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a year now. I love the moisturizing products that moisturize without greasiness. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is anti-age cream is moisturizing and firming, has a delicate clean smell (not obtrusive).  The results won me over.  My skin feels and looks wonderful.  The moisture is deep, penetrating - without any residue of greasiness, and lasts all day.  My skin looks glowing and brighter and my make up even looks better, when applied after using this cream.  This is, hands down, the best anti-age face cream I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face cream. Expensive, but lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for years. It is just the best. The only cream I use day and night.</li>
            <li> I feel that this cream is very kind to my face.  I have sensitive skin and this has not reacted in a negative way.  I have tried many brands and this is the one I always go back to.  I have been using it on and off (mostly on ) for the past 8 years.  VERY expensive, shop around for a better price, it is worth it.</li>
            <li> The product was not in its original package. I expect a cream of this quality and price to be in its original package, as described, by the seller.</li>
            <li> Just the best service and quality.  Klara</li>
            <li> I have been using Sisley products for 10 years now and I am very happy. It is pricey but worth every penny of it!</li>
