            <li>AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>I actually liked it also ~ for ONE day!</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the product and anticipate I will continue to enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>good</li>
            <li>leaves good mint taste after.</li>
            <li>and I hope that this time I will have the good sense to stick with the brand.</li>
            <li>It works good.</li>
            <li>Love this toothpaste!</li>
            <li>NOT ANY MORE!  </li>
            <li>In fact, it is better to brush with water or salt or baking soda than to brush with toothpaste!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I was using bar soap, so this product gives a much more pleasant experience.</li>
            <li>Product is amazing</li>
            <li>This is an amazing Product.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice mint flavor.</li>
            <li>Love it.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with the ingredients and very pleased with all the stuff that is NOT in it.  </li>
            <li>I am delighted to say that I have been disease free for years now!  </li>
            <li>It has great features: only a couple of drops are needed to do a masterful job of cleaning your teeth, freshening your breath, and making your mouth feel super!</li>
            <li>Thus began my quest for a safe, effective toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I love this tooth soap.  </li>
            <li>try a citrus flavor since our son doesn&#x27;t *love* the mint soap.</li>
            <li>The information gleaned from that event sent me on a quest to find a safe toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I was so relieved and pleased to be able to purchase Tooth Soap Peppermint Liquid.</li>
            <li>I like it better than the shaved bits of soap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>Still, I like it better than any paste.</li>
            <li>Yes, it has a bit of a soapy taste, but I love the taste.  </li>
            <li>My gums are so healthy and feel firmer.  </li>
            <li>is that the top of the bottle dropper cracked about 6 weeks after I started using it.  </li>
            <li>When I go travelling, I&#x27;ll take a spare dropper bottle with me, in case the top breaks again.</li>
            <li>does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and does it better than toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>feel like I have eliminated one more toxin from my environment.  </li>
            <li>teeth look better too.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it still does, but I must have gotten used to it.  </li>
            <li>I think the drops are a better value.</li>
            <li>(I also buy the whitner the Tooth Soap brand sells) over all I have been extremely satisfied</li>
            <li>I feel that my teeth feel better, they are whiter</li>
            <li>I use it with my Rotadent toothbrush and the combination of the two leaves a very clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your teeth squeaky clean when you run your tongue over them, just like after a visit to the dentist!  </li>
            <li>Teeth feel really clean after!</li>
            <li>Amazing how we are sold so many things as safe for us when the facts are they are really harmful.</li>
            <li>This is a good product for someone who wants to not use fluoride in their tooth paste.</li>
            <li>its good, works well, thanks</li>
            <li>My teeth get a clean healthy wash and look brighter and feel stronger.</li>
            <li>I think the taste, or very mild taste, is fine.  </li>
            <li>Tastes fine.  </li>
            <li>so i am looking for a more mild one, but</li>
            <li>My teeth felt very clean and there was not a bad taste.</li>
            <li>It was just cheap plastic</li>
            <li>, they feel really smooth, like when you have just had a cleaning at the dentist.</li>
            <li>My dentist gives me free toothpaste, floss and toothbrushes when I get my cleanings done.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy this product.  </li>
            <li>I was in search of something free of fluoride and glycerin.  </li>
            <li>This fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using this primarily for our 20-month old as an alternative to &amp;#34;toddler toothpastes&amp;#34; - since this is non-toxic as well, we thought this would be a good option while getting any additional benefits from the oil blend.</li>
            <li>this is my favorite part of it, that I don&#x27;t have to wait to eat/drink something without it tasting funny.</li>
            <li>My teeth felt clean and mouth fresh!</li>
            <li>I feel like I need to repeat to get my teeth fully clean.</li>
            <li>Teeth feel clean</li>
            <li>My teeth feel slippery clean every time and they are whiter, which I did not figure on.  </li>
            <li>gets my teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>Teeth feel clean.  </li>
            <li>The soapy taste is hardly noticeable and it makes your teeth feel wonderful.</li>
            <li>Bottle still 3/4 full.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel super clean every time I use the product.</li>
            <li>It was soapier in that it foamed up a lot this time but again there was no bad taste or problems.</li>
            <li>Leaves the mouth feeling squeaky clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Super quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I am more likely to brush more often with this tooth paste.  </li>
            <li>I bought this a few months ago, and was quite happy with it.</li>
            <li>The taste of brushing with nothing is much less pleasant to a mild soapy taste</li>
            <li>Mouth feels fresh.  </li>
            <li>Due to this you might be best off purchasing the solid flakes instead.</li>
            <li>It makes my teeth feel much more clean than brushing with regular toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>and it not taste right immediately afterward...</li>
            <li>My teeth really feel clean after brushing with this soap.  </li>
            <li>After catching my little ones and older ones eating the toddler, training toothpaste i was looking for a safe alternative that would keep them from ingesting it.</li>
            <li>I no longer have to gag for the first three hours of my day after brushing my teeth with toothpaste.</li>
            <li>First we had peppermint liquid.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I felt that I needed to report this to make others aware.</li>
            <li>Yes, at first it does taste like soap...</li>
            <li>My parents fell in love with it instantly.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>nothing that will make them want to &amp;#34;eat&amp;#34; it again ;)</li>
            <li>I tried Tooth Soap a few years ago &amp; liked it very much so bought it again.  </li>
            <li>Since this is soap, I can&#x27;t complain too much about the taste, but be aware before buying that it really does taste like soap.</li>
            <li>that you know is made out of only 4 ingredients, all of which are fine in my book.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This tooth soap has worked very well.  </li>
            <li>I use 3-4 drops and while it is not supersweet there is a minty essence to it, it does foam up and your teeth feel &amp;#34;just left the dentist&amp;#34; smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Buy this product, I highly recommend this to anybody and everybody!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, you can tell I must really like it, because despite all that I just bought another bottle.  </li>
            <li>DO feel like i have to use more than I expected</li>
            <li>but I did not see a readily avaiable alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely couldn&#x27;t stand it, I think because I could taste the olive oil, and I don&#x27;t like that taste.  </li>
            <li>I MUCH prefer this to water.  </li>
            <li>etc. could really help.  </li>
            <li>$20 is really a bit too much for the product.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>However, Toothsoap washes clean, allowing teeth to properly remineralize.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice not to have all the strange colorings that the regular toothpaste has.</li>
            <li>especially based on other reviews from other websites to get a good clean</li>
            <li>and it split in half just from normal screwing of the top on.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Hoping my youngest at 19 mos old doesn&#x27;t have to!!</li>
            <li>There was a slight soap taste but the result was a very clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I use it as well and notice that our teeth just feel cleaner after using it (compared to normal toothpaste).</li>
            <li>Mom of 7 + 5 so far needed dental surgery between ages 2-4 yrs old!!!</li>
            <li>I learned then that most of the toothpastes that had been taken for granted as \\&quot;safe\\&quot; were not safe at all either.</li>
            <li>After reading many of the reviews, I was anxious to see how it tasted and felt while brushing.</li>
            <li>When I opened my mouth to take a look, I saw that the entire inside was raw and bright red,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only just started using this product, but I really like it thus far.</li>
            <li>I flushed my mouth with clear water.</li>
            <li>It has all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>but it seems my teeth are cleaner that using all natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li>, I just move the toothbrush as fast as I can and the 3rd drop falls in the sink) &amp; this made all the difference in the world, to me, taste-wise.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting ready to try the cinnamon shreds next.  </li>
            <li>~ I may just be sensitive to the ingredients in it ~</li>
            <li>I developed gum disease from not going to dentists and then going to ones who didn&#x27;t know what they were doing.  </li>
            <li>How many people recall the consumer scare a few years ago re: toothpaste made in China which, on the box and outside tube, was made to resemble a well known brand that we&#x27;ve been using here in the U.S.A. forever?</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way to cleaning &amp; refreshing your teeth &amp; mouth.  </li>
            <li>I finally found the EWG website where Tooth Soap Peppermint Liquid received a decent rating.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t use much of the product so the bottle lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>The new one is for a different bathroom of the house.</li>
            <li>I guess the real test will be when I go back for my next checkup</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, taste and same results as dr bonner&#x27;s soap, but more expensive,  cleans teeth well, little soap taste.  </li>
            <li>After purchasing and using this tooth soap regularly for a couple of weeks, my gums do not feel sensitive at all in those areas.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not gross for a natural tooth cleaner.</li>
            <li>And we&#x27;ve been using vegan, \\&quot;natural\\&quot; toothpaste for 16 years, now, but I much prefer these ingredients and this product, to any other we&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The peppermint may be a little too hot for them</li>
            <li>My gums are tight, strong, and I have no more pain.  </li>

            <li> I tried Tooth Soap a few years ago &amp; liked it very much so bought it again.  </li>
            <li> Since this is soap, I can&#x27;t complain too much about the taste, but be aware before buying that it really does taste like soap.</li>
            <li> that you know is made out of only 4 ingredients, all of which are fine in my book.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This tooth soap has worked very well.  </li>
            <li> I use 3-4 drops and while it is not supersweet there is a minty essence to it, it does foam up and your teeth feel &amp;#34;just left the dentist&amp;#34; smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Buy this product, I highly recommend this to anybody and everybody!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, you can tell I must really like it, because despite all that I just bought another bottle.  </li>
            <li> DO feel like i have to use more than I expected</li>
            <li> but I did not see a readily avaiable alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely couldn&#x27;t stand it, I think because I could taste the olive oil, and I don&#x27;t like that taste.  </li>
            <li> I MUCH prefer this to water.  </li>
            <li> etc. could really help.  </li>
            <li> $20 is really a bit too much for the product.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> However, Toothsoap washes clean, allowing teeth to properly remineralize.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nice not to have all the strange colorings that the regular toothpaste has.</li>
            <li> especially based on other reviews from other websites to get a good clean</li>
            <li> and it split in half just from normal screwing of the top on.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> Hoping my youngest at 19 mos old doesn&#x27;t have to!!</li>
            <li> There was a slight soap taste but the result was a very clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I use it as well and notice that our teeth just feel cleaner after using it (compared to normal toothpaste).</li>
            <li> Mom of 7 + 5 so far needed dental surgery between ages 2-4 yrs old!!!</li>
            <li> I learned then that most of the toothpastes that had been taken for granted as \\&quot;safe\\&quot; were not safe at all either.</li>
            <li> After reading many of the reviews, I was anxious to see how it tasted and felt while brushing.</li>
            <li> When I opened my mouth to take a look, I saw that the entire inside was raw and bright red,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only just started using this product, but I really like it thus far.</li>
            <li> I flushed my mouth with clear water.</li>
            <li> It has all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> but it seems my teeth are cleaner that using all natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li> , I just move the toothbrush as fast as I can and the 3rd drop falls in the sink) &amp; this made all the difference in the world, to me, taste-wise.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting ready to try the cinnamon shreds next.  </li>
            <li> ~ I may just be sensitive to the ingredients in it ~</li>
            <li> I developed gum disease from not going to dentists and then going to ones who didn&#x27;t know what they were doing.  </li>
            <li> How many people recall the consumer scare a few years ago re: toothpaste made in China which, on the box and outside tube, was made to resemble a well known brand that we&#x27;ve been using here in the U.S.A. forever?</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way to cleaning &amp; refreshing your teeth &amp; mouth.  </li>
            <li> I finally found the EWG website where Tooth Soap Peppermint Liquid received a decent rating.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t use much of the product so the bottle lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> The new one is for a different bathroom of the house.</li>
            <li> I guess the real test will be when I go back for my next checkup</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, taste and same results as dr bonner&#x27;s soap, but more expensive,  cleans teeth well, little soap taste.  </li>
            <li> After purchasing and using this tooth soap regularly for a couple of weeks, my gums do not feel sensitive at all in those areas.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not gross for a natural tooth cleaner.</li>
            <li> And we&#x27;ve been using vegan, \\&quot;natural\\&quot; toothpaste for 16 years, now, but I much prefer these ingredients and this product, to any other we&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The peppermint may be a little too hot for them</li>
            <li> My gums are tight, strong, and I have no more pain.  </li>
            <li> The first few uses were a bit strange - the flavor is not dominant like in store toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> brushed with nothing but water for a month or so before trying this, because I didn&#x27;t know what I would actually want to use, after researching a long list of ingredients and products.  </li>
            <li> This is the answer I have my confidence back even after a long shift</li>
            <li> I truly hate to write a negative review because it seems that so many love this product.</li>
            <li> Those two areas were a little sensitive when I brushed.  </li>
            <li> and it lasts so long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve completely switched over and have left my old toothpaste behind.</li>
            <li> In fact, today, my teeth are not sensitive to cold or sweets like they used to be, and my gums are completely healthy.  </li>
            <li> Traditional toothpaste prevents this (mainly due to the glycerin coating the teeth that prevents remineralization ...</li>
            <li> and sometimes I brush my teeth twice to make sure because i&#x27;m not used to it yet, but a plus is that it doesn&#x27;t leave a weird residue like reg. toothpaste that seems to not go away for an hour, and it doesn&#x27;t leave much of a taste that would make it weird to drink something or eat something</li>
            <li> After using about half the bottle I decided to go back to toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The bottle is small, but at only 2 drops per brushing, we still have a ton left.  </li>
            <li> you only need a little.  </li>
            <li> and i have to be careful not to breathe in with it in my mouth</li>
            <li> After a few times of it, I tried 2 drops, instead (usually a third drop comes out anyway, accidentally</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve placed 3 orders of this and out of the three one was crushed when it arrived.  </li>
            <li> I  have used this for several years and just plain wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> So as others have said, decent product poor packaging.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviews say it&#x27;s a bit soapy.</li>
            <li> those wondering, the taste isn&#x27;t bad at all, easy to get used to it.</li>
            <li> It makes my teeth feel very clean, but I am disappointed that it expires in two months.</li>
            <li> So after using Tooth Soap for a few weeks, I noticed that the sensitivity to cold that I had in my teeth abated significantly, and my gums seemed a lot healthier.  </li>
            <li> and so was conventional brushing.  </li>
            <li> I ended up having to dump it down the drain, and I had about 2/3 to 3/4 of the bottle remaining.  </li>
            <li> The second day that i used it, the whole inside of my mouth started burning really bad.</li>
            <li> But wish it was a bit less costly.</li>
            <li> you use glycerin, it will prevent your teeth from regrowing (yes slight damage to teeth CAN be healed!)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Slight soapy taste</li>
            <li> Just wish it was half the price.  </li>
            <li> is a little bit minty although the fact that it IS soap of course you can taste the soapiness when brushing</li>
            <li> A little research helped me to discover stuff like Vitamin D3</li>
            <li> and yes it is a little soapy.  </li>
            <li> Each time it arrived with a little bubblewrap in a brown envelope.  </li>
            <li> A little cardboard box instead of an envelope would prevent a lot of headache...</li>
            <li> Neither salt nor bicarbonate of soda were options since they are both way too harsh for me.</li>
            <li> Looks like 90% of this bottle will go to waste.  </li>
            <li> Have had for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Because of one of the other reviews, I started with two drops to reduce any negative taste.</li>
            <li> I bought this a while back, and seriously hated the taste for the first few days.  </li>
            <li> Look I suffered from bad breath for years for real and now is gone throw out everything else</li>
            <li> I cannot believe I paid so much for something that tastes so bad.</li>
            <li> We use 2 drops for our son (along with a small dollop of coconut oil) and ~4 drops for the adults.</li>
            <li> so I can get past the taste.  </li>
            <li> The most disgusting taste ever.</li>
            <li> Not sure, coconut and soap.</li>
            <li> and cold-sensitive areas along the gum line, at least for me.</li>
            <li> one complaint</li>
            <li> My dentist (who was a dishonest crook, turns out)</li>
            <li> I had quite serious gum disease, receding gums etc.  </li>
            <li> Given the high cost of the bottle, this was a painful thing to do!  </li>
            <li> Years of repairs, deep, painful cleansings, expensive fillings, etc., etc.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t realize how abrasive and irritating toothpaste is till you switch to tooth soap.</li>
            <li> Poor job Amazon, even if it was a lightening deal.</li>
            <li> The theory behind toothsoap is that teeth can cure dental caries and cavities by remineralizing.  </li>
            <li> I was unhappy with my toothpaste as it contained floride</li>
            <li> The horrible burning and redness lasted 4-5 days!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this tooth soap.  It makes my teeth feel much more clean than brushing with regular toothpaste.  The dental hygienist told me I had two areas where my gums were receding.  Those two areas were a little sensitive when I brushed.  After purchasing and using this tooth soap regularly for a couple of weeks, my gums do not feel sensitive at all in those areas.  I guess the real test will be when I go back for my next checkup but I expect to have a good report from the dental hygienist.&lt;br /&gt;For those wondering, the taste isn&#x27;t bad at all, easy to get used to it.</li>
            <li> Since this is soap, I can&#x27;t complain too much about the taste, but be aware before buying that it really does taste like soap.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this primarily for our 20-month old as an alternative to &amp;#34;toddler toothpastes&amp;#34; - since this is non-toxic as well, we thought this would be a good option while getting any additional benefits from the oil blend. My husband and I use it as well and notice that our teeth just feel cleaner after using it (compared to normal toothpaste). We use 2 drops for our son (along with a small dollop of coconut oil) and ~4 drops for the adults. If I order again, I&#x27;ll likey try a citrus flavor since our son doesn&#x27;t *love* the mint soap.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only just started using this product, but I really like it thus far. Because of one of the other reviews, I started with two drops to reduce any negative taste. My teeth felt very clean and there was not a bad taste. The next time I tried 4 drops. It was soapier in that it foamed up a lot this time but again there was no bad taste or problems. I&#x27;m very happy with the product and anticipate I will continue to enjoy using it. My teeth felt clean and mouth fresh!</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> I use it with my Rotadent toothbrush and the combination of the two leaves a very clean feeling.  I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> How many people recall the consumer scare a few years ago re: toothpaste made in China which, on the box and outside tube, was made to resemble a well known brand that we&#x27;ve been using here in the U.S.A. forever? I learned then that most of the toothpastes that had been taken for granted as \\&quot;safe\\&quot; were not safe at all either. The information gleaned from that event sent me on a quest to find a safe toothpaste. Neither salt nor bicarbonate of soda were options since they are both way too harsh for me. Thus began my quest for a safe, effective toothpaste. I finally found the EWG website where Tooth Soap Peppermint Liquid received a decent rating. But where would I find such a product? Ta-Da! Amazon to the rescue!! I was so relieved and pleased to be able to purchase Tooth Soap Peppermint Liquid. It has great features: only a couple of drops are needed to do a masterful job of cleaning your teeth, freshening your breath, and making your mouth feel super! There&#x27;s no harshness in it whatsoever. I will continue to purchase this product, and I dearly hope that Amazon continues to keep it in stock. Thank you,  Amazon!  You did it again!</li>
            <li> Like other reviews say it&#x27;s a bit soapy. I don&#x27;t quite know how I feel about the cleanliness of my teeth after using. I feel like I need to repeat to get my teeth fully clean. I think this will be the only time I purchase this product.</li>
            <li> i have not used the liquid version of Tooth Soap before. I like it better than the shaved bits of soap. The soapy taste is hardly noticeable and it makes your teeth feel wonderful. It heals heat- and cold-sensitive areas along the gum line, at least for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK. It&#x27;s not gross for a natural tooth cleaner. After using about half the bottle I decided to go back to toothpaste.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!  I had receding gums and tooth sensitivity.  NOT ANY MORE!  My gums are tight, strong, and I have no more pain.  You don&#x27;t realize how abrasive and irritating toothpaste is till you switch to tooth soap.</li>
            <li> Great tooth soap! But wish it was a bit less costly. Hence the 4 star rating.</li>
            <li> This tooth soap has worked very well.  Very happy with it and the speed of delivery was very good also.</li>
            <li> After reading many of the reviews, I was anxious to see how it tasted and felt while brushing. I use 3-4 drops and while it is not supersweet there is a minty essence to it, it does foam up and your teeth feel &amp;#34;just left the dentist&amp;#34; smooth.</li>
            <li> It makes my teeth feel very clean, but I am disappointed that it expires in two months.</li>
            <li> Taste is ok-like soap.  Not peppermint-y to me.  Teeth feel clean so I can get past the taste.  The biggest deal breaker for me is that I received this on August 14, 2015-It expires in October 1st 2015.  Suggested &amp;#34;serving&amp;#34; is 2-3 drops.  Boo!  Looks like 90% of this bottle will go to waste.  Poor job Amazon, even if it was a lightening deal.</li>
            <li> Look I suffered from bad breath for years for real and now is gone throw out everything else this is the answer.... My daughter uses now too and big help for both of us... Product is amazing I tried every mouthwash on amazon and at all stores. This is the answer I have my confidence back even after a long shift</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this to brush my teeth now for almost 6 months and I&#x27;ve noticed my once-antibiotic-stained teeth are clearing up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A miracle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t trust Big Phama!&lt;br /&gt;Glycerin chokes your teeth, and prevents them from breathing (your teeth are pores)!&lt;br /&gt;If you use glycerin, it will prevent your teeth from regrowing (yes slight damage to teeth CAN be healed!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this product, I highly recommend this to anybody and everybody!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as an alternative to toothpaste and all the chemicals in the toothpaste.  My grandson does not like toothpaste but he does like this.  I think the taste, or very mild taste, is fine.  My teeth really feel clean after brushing with this soap.  My husand and son both tried it and they do not like the taste.</li>
            <li> I tried Tooth Soap a few years ago &amp; liked it very much so bought it again.  A little goes a long way to cleaning &amp; refreshing your teeth &amp; mouth.  It has all natural ingredients. Does not have fluoride in it so that could be a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> good but does not taste like mint, just soap. Still, I like it better than any paste. Just not minty.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing Product.  Yes, it has a bit of a soapy taste, but I love the taste.  My teeth feel slippery clean every time and they are whiter, which I did not figure on.  My gums are so healthy and feel firmer.  I will never go back to regular toothpaste.  Have had for a few weeks.  Bottle still 3/4 full.  Should hast quite awhile. I just use a couple of drops on my toothbrush at a time. A great value even at its price.  Should work out close to the same as cost for regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for someone who wants to not use fluoride in their tooth paste. It has a nice mint flavor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, taste and same results as dr bonner&#x27;s soap, but more expensive,  cleans teeth well, little soap taste.  I want to get further away from all the junk in toothpaste, including toms, etc...</li>
            <li> I bought this a few months ago, and was quite happy with it. It leaves your teeth squeaky clean when you run your tongue over them, just like after a visit to the dentist!  The taste does take some getting used to; if you&#x27;re used to brushing your tongue along with your teeth, I recommend you use toothpaste for that, not this stuff, because it will take forever for the soap taste to fade.  While pricey, you can expect one bottle to last several months if you just use a couple of drops on your brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one complaint I have about this is that the top of the bottle dropper cracked about 6 weeks after I started using it.  It was just cheap plastic and it split in half just from normal screwing of the top on. This happened while I was travelling, so I had nothing to pour the remaining tooth soap into.  I ended up having to dump it down the drain, and I had about 2/3 to 3/4 of the bottle remaining.  Given the high cost of the bottle, this was a painful thing to do!  I considered emailing the company about it, but if I had already used up to 1/3 of the bottle, I don&#x27;t know if they would consider a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, you can tell I must really like it, because despite all that I just bought another bottle.  This time, however, I also ordered 1 oz dropper bottles, and I&#x27;ve poured the big bottle into two of those.  When I go travelling, I&#x27;ll take a spare dropper bottle with me, in case the top breaks again.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel super clean every time I use the product. Slight soapy taste but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. Goes away as soon as you rise out your mouth.</li>
            <li> Great product. Super quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on what someone else recommended and it seems to work and it&#x27;s not as soapy to me as others claim it to be and I don&#x27;t like to after taste but it seems my teeth are cleaner that using all natural toothpaste. And one of my daughters uses also and she likes it.</li>
            <li> does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and does it better than toothpaste.  is a little bit minty although the fact that it IS soap of course you can taste the soapiness when brushing and i have to be careful not to breathe in with it in my mouth or i&#x27;ll catch a tickle in the throat from the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DO feel like i have to use more than I expected especially based on other reviews from other websites to get a good clean and sometimes I brush my teeth twice to make sure because i&#x27;m not used to it yet, but a plus is that it doesn&#x27;t leave a weird residue like reg. toothpaste that seems to not go away for an hour, and it doesn&#x27;t leave much of a taste that would make it weird to drink something or eat something and it not taste right immediately afterward... this is my favorite part of it, that I don&#x27;t have to wait to eat/drink something without it tasting funny.</li>
            <li> its good, works well, thanks</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste ever!!!</li>
            <li> I  have used this for several years and just plain wouldn&#x27;t be without it. Teeth and gums just keep improving.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have purchased this product.  My teeth get a clean healthy wash and look brighter and feel stronger.</li>
            <li> I was unhappy with my toothpaste as it contained floride but I did not see a readily avaiable alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read some things on line about tooth soap and thought I will give it a try.  Got Peppermint.  The first few uses were a bit strange - the flavor is not dominant like in store toothpastes.  There was a slight soap taste but the result was a very clean feeling.  I find now I am more likely to brush more often with this tooth paste.  My gums stopped bleeding too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I have eliminated one more toxin from my environment.  I can do something about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth look better too.  Amazing how we are sold so many things as safe for us when the facts are they are really harmful.</li>
            <li> I no longer have to gag for the first three hours of my day after brushing my teeth with toothpaste. This product was just what I needed !!! I love it. I even got my son to use it and he enjoys it as well and he&#x27;s only 19!!! Thank You Tube soap for just being here😀</li>
            <li> I bought this a while back, and seriously hated the taste for the first few days.  I absolutely couldn&#x27;t stand it, I think because I could taste the olive oil, and I don&#x27;t like that taste.  I was doing 3 drops then.  After a few times of it, I tried 2 drops, instead (usually a third drop comes out anyway, accidentally, I just move the toothbrush as fast as I can and the 3rd drop falls in the sink) &amp; this made all the difference in the world, to me, taste-wise.  Now I am all about this stuff.  Love it.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with the ingredients and very pleased with all the stuff that is NOT in it.  And we&#x27;ve been using vegan, \\&quot;natural\\&quot; toothpaste for 16 years, now, but I much prefer these ingredients and this product, to any other we&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;I brushed with nothing but water for a month or so before trying this, because I didn&#x27;t know what I would actually want to use, after researching a long list of ingredients and products.  I MUCH prefer this to water.  The taste of brushing with nothing is much less pleasant to a mild soapy taste that you know is made out of only 4 ingredients, all of which are fine in my book.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product.  I&#x27;m getting ready to try the cinnamon shreds next.  First we had peppermint liquid.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and it lasts so long.  The bottle is small, but at only 2 drops per brushing, we still have a ton left.  The new one is for a different bathroom of the house.</li>
            <li> I truly hate to write a negative review because it seems that so many love this product. I actually liked it also ~ for ONE day! The second day that i used it, the whole inside of my mouth started burning really bad. I flushed my mouth with clear water. When I opened my mouth to take a look, I saw that the entire inside was raw and bright red, The horrible burning and redness lasted 4-5 days!! Now I&#x27;m NOT implying that this will happen to others ~ I may just be sensitive to the ingredients in it ~ but I felt that I needed to report this to make others aware. Have a Blessed Day!!</li>
            <li> This product quite literally saved my teeth.  I had quite serious gum disease, receding gums etc.  My dentist (who was a dishonest crook, turns out) kept telling me that I would ultimately need gum surgery to save my teeth, and in the meantime I could only floss and brush (which I was doing already).  A little research helped me to discover stuff like Vitamin D3 etc. could really help.  But the turning point was when I was referred to Tooth Soap on a parenting message board.  The theory behind toothsoap is that teeth can cure dental caries and cavities by remineralizing.  Traditional toothpaste prevents this (mainly due to the glycerin coating the teeth that prevents remineralization ... in addition to fluoride being a poison which cannot possible serve any legitimate health need).  However, Toothsoap washes clean, allowing teeth to properly remineralize.  In fact, it is better to brush with water or salt or baking soda than to brush with toothpaste!  Toothpaste is likely a contributing factor to tooth decay!  So after using Tooth Soap for a few weeks, I noticed that the sensitivity to cold that I had in my teeth abated significantly, and my gums seemed a lot healthier.  In fact, today, my teeth are not sensitive to cold or sweets like they used to be, and my gums are completely healthy.  Again, this can be done probably with just avoiding toothpaste entirely.  But Tooth Soap has the added benefit of cleaning your mouth, so why not.  Just wish it was half the price.  $20 is really a bit too much for the product.</li>
            <li> Tastes fine.  I don&#x27;t mind swallowing after brushing.</li>
            <li> Love it! Teeth feel really clean after! Very different feeling to it than regular toothpaste. Mom of 7 + 5 so far needed dental surgery between ages 2-4 yrs old!!! Hoping my youngest at 19 mos old doesn&#x27;t have to!! I use tooth soap on his baby teeth!!</li>
            <li> Leaves the mouth feeling squeaky clean and fresh. I was using bar soap, so this product gives a much more pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t use much of the product so the bottle lasts a long time.  It does make my teeth feel cleaner and yes it is a little soapy.  I don&#x27;t mind the soapiness since my teeth don&#x27;t have that grungy pasty feeling anymore, they feel really smooth, like when you have just had a cleaning at the dentist.</li>
            <li> My dentist gives me free toothpaste, floss and toothbrushes when I get my cleanings done.  I developed gum disease from not going to dentists and then going to ones who didn&#x27;t know what they were doing.  For years I was told my teeth were great!  Only to changed dentists and find out that my gums were not.  Years of repairs, deep, painful cleansings, expensive fillings, etc., etc.  I prayed to God to help me find something out there that didn&#x27;t damage my teeth and gums because throughout this process I found that toothpaste was one of the enemies (so to speak) and so was conventional brushing.  Flossing is KING!  I am delighted to say that I have been disease free for years now!  God bless!  Enjoy this product.  I do.</li>
            <li> this stuff rocks.. you only need a little.  gets my teeth clean.  leaves good mint taste after.</li>
            <li> The most disgusting taste ever. Might as well eat a bar of soap. I cannot believe I paid so much for something that tastes so bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve placed 3 orders of this and out of the three one was crushed when it arrived.  Each time it arrived with a little bubblewrap in a brown envelope.  A little cardboard box instead of an envelope would prevent a lot of headache... So as others have said, decent product poor packaging.  Due to this you might be best off purchasing the solid flakes instead.</li>
            <li> Yes, at first it does taste like soap...I&#x27;m sure it still does, but I must have gotten used to it.  I was in search of something free of fluoride and glycerin.  This fit the bill.  Teeth feel clean.  Mouth feels fresh.  I have already suggested it to others.  My parents fell in love with it instantly. They both said it made their teeth feel as if they had just gotten them cleaned at the dentist.  I also use Neem Tooth Powder and Essential Oxygen&#x27;s Brushing Rinse (of which I will be a user for life).  Last dental cleaning--hygienist said I wasn&#x27;t giving her anything to work on.&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased the whipped tooth soap.  I think the drops are a better value.</li>
            <li> I have been switching between traditional soap and tooth soap for about two years now and I always end up going back - My teeth are cleaner they look whiter (I also buy the whitner the Tooth Soap brand sells) over all I have been extremely satisfied and I hope that this time I will have the good sense to stick with the brand.</li>
            <li> Not sure, coconut and soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve completely switched over and have left my old toothpaste behind. I feel that my teeth feel better, they are whiter and I don&#x27;t have that yucky toothpaste feel afterwards. It&#x27;s also nice not to have all the strange colorings that the regular toothpaste has.</li>
            <li> It works good. It has helped my gums quite a bit. They have stopped bleeding. No flouride, excellent! I will definitely buy more. Thanks</li>
            <li> After catching my little ones and older ones eating the toddler, training toothpaste i was looking for a safe alternative that would keep them from ingesting it. This is great! The peppermint may be a little too hot for them so i am looking for a more mild one, but nothing that will make them want to &amp;#34;eat&amp;#34; it again ;)</li>
