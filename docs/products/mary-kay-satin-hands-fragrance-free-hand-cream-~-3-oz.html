            <li> I have bought this product for years and I cannot find any other product that&lt;br /&gt;works as well as this hand cream does.</li>
            <li> I was very disapointed with this product. The one I used before was wonderful but this one in no better than regular vaselin ( lotion). I guess it is for people with no dry hand issues.</li>
            <li> Perfect for winter hands! Not greasy</li>
            <li> This may be fragrance free, but it is stinky.  It does moisturize ok, but makes my hands feel chalky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered from amazon on 3 separate occasions.  Every single time, there&#x27;s been a problem.  Twice I&#x27;ve had damaged items and now today, my item was totally missing from the package.  So I can not rate this item ( since I don&#x27;t have it). Mostly I&#x27;m just very frustrated with using amazon to do any ordering.</li>
            <li> Great product! Love that it&#x27;s fragrance free and leaves my skin soft but not oily.</li>
            <li> Loved the hand cream.  It is endorsed by Steve Harvey on his TV show.  What could be a better rating.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Mary Kay handcream.  The small tubes go great in purses!  I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> Smells weird like twenty year old lotion .  Will be returning!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t aware it was fragrance free.  That is my oversight.  It does absorb well, I  do prefer fragrance in lotioning products.</li>
            <li> This hand cream is the best one on the market. After one application my \\&quot; working hands \\&quot; felt softer than after any other lotion I&#x27;ve tried.the seller was very good...timely delivery + good price.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I borrowed a lil from my wife.... Then received compliments for others that same day. So I will buy more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but nothing but, nothing to shout about , and get excited . I dont&#x27; feel the satiny feeling it feels like regular hand cream .</li>
            <li> This product is the best on the market!&lt;br /&gt;It truly does leave your hands feeling like satin.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my feet also. I feel like I am walking&lt;br /&gt;on air. What a difference this cream makes to&lt;br /&gt;your feet and hands. Remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing like Satin Hands!&lt;br /&gt;I love all of the Mary Kay products but cannot&lt;br /&gt;Live without the hand cream.&lt;br /&gt;Polly</li>
            <li> Got it for my wife.  She loves it.  Winning.</li>
            <li> Hands feel soft after use.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hand cream...The best I&#x27;ve ever used...I like that it is fragrance free and after applying, my hands really do feel like satin...very soft and younger looking...It absorbs quickly and hydrates the skin well even in coldest winter weather when my hands become very dry and rough.  My order arrived promptly and sealed in the original plastic covering...(Obviously new and fresh)...I highly recommend this product...and the seller...</li>
            <li> Hands feel real soft. I like it.</li>
            <li> My favorite hand cream!</li>
            <li> Love this hand  cream. This may sound funny but if you put this on bug bites it stops the itching. My neighbor had a huge spider bite that was driving her nuts. She put this on and the itching stopped.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife. She tends to have dry skin-- especially in cold weather. This cream has been a lifesaver. When the weather is really cold she uses it several times a day and it greatly helps to keep her skin from getting too dry and/or cracking. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought three tubes of this hand cream - one for myself, and one for each of my grandsons.  They have a lot of problems with their hands cracking open and bleeding from dryness.  It works great to alleviate this problem.</li>
            <li> This is great for your hands, they do feel like satin after using.  I received this as gift and loved it so much, I purchased for someone else.  She is sensitive to scents so this was perfect as it is scent free and is a great hand cream.</li>
            <li> Great for chapped hands.</li>
            <li> Moisturization from this product lasts all day long! Even after hand-washings my hands still feel nourished. The condition of my cuticles has improved. A great lotion to keep on your desk at work, or in your glove compartment or purse!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the SatinHands Hand Softener but I bought this by accident. It&#x27;s just another s***ty lotion.</li>
            <li> This has no smell and lubricates the hands and arms without the sticky feeling from other lesser creams. My hubby uses this and swears by it. He cannot stand the smell of other creams which is why he prefers to pay a little more for this.</li>
            <li> Wonderful on the hands and non sticky</li>
            <li> I have dry cracked hands constantly and this lotion does the trick! Works great and it absorbs quickly! It&#x27;s not greasy, oily, or thick. Love it!</li>
            <li> I was so glad to see this available online because I was having a hard time locating it...I love this hand cream</li>
            <li> This product is great! I don&#x27;t like smelly lotions or or one that you have to keep reapplying bc one coat isn&#x27;t enough. Satin hands is a great product and one coat lasts for hours at a time. I will definitely repurchase this item.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my friend who doesn&#x27;t like fragrances.  She loves the feel of the lotion without odor.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery.  Item arrived as described.</li>
            <li> love mary kay handcream.  have been using for many years and find this by far is a awesome handcream..</li>
            <li> Ordered Mary Kay Satin Hands Hand frangrance free hand Softner which is clear and is a light ointment 2.1oz. Labeled for hands, but excellent moisturizer for the face.  Instead recieved Mary Kay Satin Hands fragrance free hand Cream which is a white lotion type product, 3oz. goes on hands satin but as disolves into skin feels like nothing put on and leaves hands feeling somewhat dry.</li>
            <li> Works Good, Not Greasy</li>
            <li> This product is great! I will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that has healed my horrible cracked cuticles. Put it on every night-wake up with healed smooth hands.  Like magic!</li>
            <li> Great product. Great price, Fast delivery i will for sure buy more.</li>
            <li> Excellent hand cream. It is not greasy and does the job on dry skin. I like Mary Kay products because they do not test on animals.</li>
            <li> This hand cream is so great, I know I will be ordering much more of this. Leaves your hands soft and not at all greasey</li>
