            <li>I love Palmers Cocoa butter anything/</li>
            <li>I love the smell of cocoa butter, so was looking forward to bathing with it.  </li>
            <li>This soap was just okay.</li>
            <li>I love my this Cocoa Butter soap, I use all the Palmer products line.</li>
            <li>I love love love this soap.</li>
            <li>The creaminess of this soap feels like Dove, but a bit more astringent.</li>
            <li>but it is an amazingly moisturizing body wash wish a fantastic list of ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I was pleased in comparison to many of the overly perfumed soaps.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>here are the required seven additional words ok?</li>
            <li>I love Palmer&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>Great product and decent prices</li>
            <li>I felt really clean after using it and it smelled really nice.</li>
            <li>how excited I was to find this product!</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I saw this soap!</li>
            <li>I liked this soap but didn&#x27;t love it; it has a hint of cocoa scent and was very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I strongly suggest if you&#x27;re looking for what this product claims to do; try the brand Shea Moisture.</li>
            <li>I liked how my skin looks now, as Ive been using it for about a month, my skin tone is pretty even</li>
            <li>I bought this soap because previously I was using Dial bar soap which is not the best for the skin.  </li>
            <li>It is great moisturizer and my skin feels super soft all day without any lotion.</li>
            <li>Palmer&#x27;s makes great products and their soap did not disappoint me, a bit pricey, but most of their products cost a little more than similar items, but they seam to have a great smell.  </li>
            <li>, it keeps my skin smooth even when I do not use body lotion after.</li>
            <li>even use it on my face and my face feels smooth</li>
            <li>And, it has the most delicious and delicate chocolate</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since my first night trying it I&#x27;ve used it almost a week to make sure I was using correctly or allowing my skin to adjust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It comes off cleanly when rinsing.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel like the skin is moisturized, although feels clean ....</li>
            <li>This soap has been a phenomenal replacement-it really helps keep my face radiant and acne free.</li>
            <li>I searched this Amazon listing and read the reviews to make sure it was a smart purchase; then I proceeded to rush home and try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it smells so rich and feels super silky.</li>
            <li>I do most of my families shopping at Wal-Mart and had been looking a long time for a nice moisturizing body wash I could buy.</li>
            <li>I have many scars from mosquito bites on my body and this soap coupled with using the palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter lotion has really helped diminish them.</li>
            <li>Overall good</li>
            <li>It does have a &amp;#34;slimy&amp;#34; texture, but I actually found it felt good.  </li>
            <li>I have (I scar pretty easily)</li>
            <li>It also smells fabulous (like chocolate) and is so creamy and good for my very dry skin.</li>
            <li>This soap is super as are all of Palmer&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li>It was better than most commercial soaps, but I am used to Dove</li>
            <li>They got this to me super quick.</li>
            <li>I did notice that after maybe 5-10 minutes the feeling did subside and my skin felt fairly calm.</li>
            <li>I found this soap pleasant but probably not worth the price.  </li>
            <li>positives:&lt;br /&gt;-It has a good ingredient list; stays fairly natural and not using harsh ingredients and appears very moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;-The scent; the fragrance isn&#x27;t amazing</li>
            <li>The moment water touched the nice creamy lather I mentioned my skin immediately felt like rubber and very stretched.</li>
            <li>I normally use the original dove soap</li>
            <li>The first time I used this soap, I didn&#x27;t feel like a reptile anymore.  </li>
            <li>I think what I appreciate the most is that it smooths the overall texture of your complexion along with getting rid of acne.</li>
            <li>This soap keeps it with a more &amp;#34;normal skin&amp;#34; texture instead of dry and flaky.</li>
            <li>Then I am certain that their soaps are as well?</li>
            <li>This made a huge difference, and I noticed it instantly.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to try this soap out because I really like the cocoa butter lotions and creams Palmer&#x27;s makes.</li>
            <li>I will buy it again very soon.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ll mention below in my positives/negatives the moment you rinse off the lather of this soap you immediately feel an intense stretching and rubber-like feel on your skin.</li>
            <li>It really helped with my skin by making it softer.</li>
            <li>I will purchase more in the near future.</li>
            <li>and I was expecting more of a &#x27;chocolately&#x27; smell like other Palmer&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>i love it, would not use any other soap again .i</li>
            <li>It very very strong and heavy and made me dizzy.</li>
            <li>If you only use the bar soap by itself it will make your skin feel kind of dry</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the soap, but I did hope it would moisturize my skin better during the winter-time - that&#x27;s why I bought it, to avoid the usual dry, itchy winter-time skin.</li>
            <li>Wal-mart seems to carry nice quality hair products but very few body washes and soaps.</li>
            <li>MAKES YOUR SKIN FEEL REALLY SOFT, BUT IT DID NOT LATHER AS MUCH</li>
            <li>I need to order more as I am not sure what I will do if I run out haha.</li>
            <li>For the time I had the product it was great, when I came back home one week and went to shower, it was gone and there was no more left.</li>
            <li>it made my skin very soft .</li>
            <li>I was nervous about using this soap, because I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>this is what I use to clear the acne from my face-</li>
            <li>That and extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I receive compliments all the time on how soft my skin is.</li>
            <li>and this will help replenish her natural oils.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sensitive to soap smells.  </li>
            <li>This soap doesn&#x27;t irritate and keeps my skin soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I was previously using Aveeno which was great for maintaining my skin and washing off makeup but not good for getting rid of pimples once they showed up.</li>
            <li>If it weren&#x27;t for the fact they say, &amp;#34;specially formulated to cleanse, without leaving a dry, tight feeling&amp;#34; I would give it a better star rating and just not be a fan.</li>
            <li>I will never go back to my old brand and this has even replaced the body wash I was using which is for my specific skin</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend for dry and sensitive skin types.</li>

            <li> I definitely recommend for dry and sensitive skin types.</li>
            <li> We live in the southwest and the climate is harsh on skin.  </li>
            <li> I use the one that says for ashy dry skin with Shea butter in the summer because its thinner and the regular cocoa butter formula lotion in the winter since its thicker.</li>
            <li> In comparison, if you have ever used a plain castile soap (Dr. Bronner&#x27;s) it has the exact tight rinse off feeling.</li>
            <li> Dry skin, dry skin, dry skin...</li>
            <li> so maybe that is why this felt dry.</li>
            <li> A must have for me since I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m extremely confused with all the overly positive reviews of this product.</li>
            <li> Gave to my daughter for christmas, she has very dry skin</li>
            <li> Product was delivered sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Since using this product my skin has become less dry.</li>
            <li> I notice it also gives my skin a glow that I do not get when I use other body washes.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will help with acne scarring and other scars</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it on my body because it feels a little too heavy for my preference but for facial needs this soap is it</li>
            <li> The scent was not very strong and it was a bit drying.</li>
            <li> However there was very little lather</li>
            <li> I usually find it at Target or CVS</li>
            <li> Immediately after toweling off, my skin was so dry that I was afraid it was about to crack.  </li>
            <li> The odor is very similar to bitter chocolate--not unpleasant, but it may not be your cup of tea, and it tends to become unpleasant in areas of the body where sweat accumulates.</li>
            <li> Worse, it doesn&#x27;t seem to moisturize my skin either.  </li>
            <li> The list of products that causes itchy skin and painful rashes is endless.  </li>
            <li> Left me with that awful &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; feeling I was trying to escape.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it dries my skin out a lot quicker than the Tone Cocoa Bars.</li>
            <li> Weird smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before using this soap, getting out of the shower was a miserable experience.  </li>

            <li> I liked this soap but didn&#x27;t love it; it has a hint of cocoa scent and was very moisturizing.  However there was very little lather and I was expecting more of a &#x27;chocolately&#x27; smell like other Palmer&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> I love Palmers Cocoa butter anything/ it smells so rich and feels super silky. I wish I could fill a tub with their cocoa butter moisturizer. it will make you smell like chocolate.</li>
            <li> Dry skin, dry skin, dry skin... the story of my life.  That and extremely sensitive skin.  The list of products that causes itchy skin and painful rashes is endless.  At the suggestion of my doctor, I decided to switch to cocoa butter EVERYTHING -- lotion, soap, you name it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using this soap, getting out of the shower was a miserable experience.  Immediately after toweling off, my skin was so dry that I was afraid it was about to crack.  I was always racing to a bottle of lotion to bring relief and rid my body of that extra-tight feeling all over my body.  A bottle of lotion would last me about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh. My. Goodness.  This made a huge difference, and I noticed it instantly.  The first time I used this soap, I didn&#x27;t feel like a reptile anymore.  What an improvement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering, and there isn&#x27;t any soap residue.  It comes off cleanly when rinsing.  Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish they made this in a body wash or shower gel form.  But until then, I&#x27;m definitely sticking with this.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This soap is super as are all of Palmer&#x27;s products.  It really smells delicious, is creamy and makes your skin feel pampered. Because of his job, my husband showers twice and day and he loves this soap.  We live in the southwest and the climate is harsh on skin.  This soap keeps it with a more &amp;#34;normal skin&amp;#34; texture instead of dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of cocoa butter, so was looking forward to bathing with it.  However, this bar soap doesn&#x27;t smell anything like cocoa butter.  Worse, it doesn&#x27;t seem to moisturize my skin either.  I won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this soap out because I really like the cocoa butter lotions and creams Palmer&#x27;s makes. This soap was just okay. The scent was not very strong and it was a bit drying. It was better than most commercial soaps, but I am used to Dove so maybe that is why this felt dry.</li>
            <li> I love my this Cocoa Butter soap, I use all the Palmer products line. If you only use the bar soap by itself it will make your skin feel kind of dry so I mix it will regular body wash. I receive compliments all the time on how soft my skin is. Would also recommend using in conjuction with the skin therapy oil after taking a shower. Perfect combination.</li>
            <li> I love love love this soap. I have many scars from mosquito bites on my body and this soap coupled with using the palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter lotion has really helped diminish them. It also smells fabulous (like chocolate) and is so creamy and good for my very dry skin. I definitely recommend for dry and sensitive skin types.</li>
            <li> The creaminess of this soap feels like Dove, but a bit more astringent. It is great moisturizer and my skin feels super soft all day without any lotion. And, it has the most delicious and delicate chocolate scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit expensive for a bar of soap, but most physical stores don&#x27;t carry it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the soap, but I did hope it would moisturize my skin better during the winter-time - that&#x27;s why I bought it, to avoid the usual dry, itchy winter-time skin.</li>
            <li> use this one your face on your body ..... leaves your face and body smelling good and your face is clean and cocoa buttered up</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is a very good bar soap, with that good coca butter smell.  I will buy it again very soon.</li>
            <li> I have been using this as a body soap for years ( never on my face) and that&#x27;s a keeper, it keeps my skin smooth even when I do not use body lotion after. I notice it also gives my skin a glow that I do not get when I use other body washes. However , I don&#x27;t know about clearing scars, clearing anything for that matter. For me this is just a good smooth soap, nothing more.</li>
            <li> MAKES YOUR SKIN FEEL REALLY SOFT, BUT IT DID NOT LATHER AS MUCH AS I&#x27;D LIKE IT TO..BUT WAS A GOOD ITEM</li>
            <li> You have no idea how excited I was to find this product! I do most of my families shopping at Wal-Mart and had been looking a long time for a nice moisturizing body wash I could buy. Wal-mart seems to carry nice quality hair products but very few body washes and soaps. I was so excited when I saw this soap! I searched this Amazon listing and read the reviews to make sure it was a smart purchase; then I proceeded to rush home and try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my first night trying it I&#x27;ve used it almost a week to make sure I was using correctly or allowing my skin to adjust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m extremely confused with all the overly positive reviews of this product. As I&#x27;ll mention below in my positives/negatives the moment you rinse off the lather of this soap you immediately feel an intense stretching and rubber-like feel on your skin. In comparison, if you have ever used a plain castile soap (Dr. Bronner&#x27;s) it has the exact tight rinse off feeling. I did notice that after maybe 5-10 minutes the feeling did subside and my skin felt fairly calm. If it weren&#x27;t for the fact they say, &amp;#34;specially formulated to cleanse, without leaving a dry, tight feeling&amp;#34; I would give it a better star rating and just not be a fan. I strongly suggest if you&#x27;re looking for what this product claims to do; try the brand Shea Moisture. I usually find it at Target or CVS but it is an amazingly moisturizing body wash wish a fantastic list of ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The positives:&lt;br /&gt;-It has a good ingredient list; stays fairly natural and not using harsh ingredients and appears very moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;-The scent; the fragrance isn&#x27;t amazing but I definitely didn&#x27;t mind it and I was pleased in comparison to many of the overly perfumed soaps.&lt;br /&gt;-The lather of this soap is very nice; the first time using it I immediately thought it was amazing because it does lather into what feels like a nice moisturizing soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negatives:&lt;br /&gt;-The rinse off feeling. The moment water touched the nice creamy lather I mentioned my skin immediately felt like rubber and very stretched.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I heard about Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter and how the products are very good. I used it and the smell is great. It really helped with my skin by making it softer. It&#x27;s a great smell, I love it. For the time I had the product it was great, when I came back home one week and went to shower, it was gone and there was no more left. It was all used up. Great product and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate in buying it again.</li>
            <li> Love palmers brands! Smells great and makes skin silky smooth. I have been using this brand for atleast 10 years if not longer. Great product and decent prices</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling smooth and smells great. A must have for me since I have dry skin. I normally use the original dove soap but I decided to change things up a bit this winter. I don&#x27;t feel itchy after I get out of the shower I did sometimes anyway when using dove. Works great in conjunction with the palmers cocoa butter lotion that I already use. I use the one that says for ashy dry skin with Shea butter in the summer because its thinner and the regular cocoa butter formula lotion in the winter since its thicker.</li>
            <li> Palmer&#x27;s makes great products and their soap did not disappoint me, a bit pricey, but most of their products cost a little more than similar items, but they seam to have a great smell.  I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> This worked great it made my skin very soft . Im going to buy me another bar because mines gone</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel like the skin is moisturized, although feels clean ....Overall good and I am happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li> Left me with that awful &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; feeling I was trying to escape. My boyfriend loves it, but that&#x27;s because he loves the squeaky feeling. Smells nice though.</li>
            <li> Since using this product my skin has become less dry. I will purchase more in the near future. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I liked how my skin looks now, as Ive been using it for about a month, my skin tone is pretty even</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Palmers skin care lotions and scar reduction remedies. If the lotions and creams are above par. Then I am certain that their soaps are as well?</li>
            <li> By far the best soap I have ever used. I will never go back to my old brand and this has even replaced the body wash I was using which is for my specific skin type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has the traditional chocolaty smell except on my face. This might just be me, but I still love it! :)</li>
            <li> is what it is....keeps my skin from drying out in the colder months..here are the required seven additional words ok?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a Palmer&#x27;s product and I like basically everything they offer.  This bar of soap is no different.  I like the way my skin feels after using it in the shower.  Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love Palmer&#x27;s products. They keep your skin so soft and smell GREAT! They got this to me super quick. I use it all the time.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap because previously I was using Dial bar soap which is not the best for the skin.  I was nervous about using this soap, because I have very sensitive skin.  However, I have had no issues with it!  It smells very good, makes your skin feel great, and it really is creamy!</li>
            <li> So I used this last night on my body and face. I felt really clean after using it and it smelled really nice. Like, chocolate and vanilla. Hopefully it will help with acne scarring and other scars I have (I scar pretty easily)</li>
            <li> Product was delivered sooner than expected. Rinses off with no residue. Unfortunately it dries my skin out a lot quicker than the Tone Cocoa Bars. Need to put some type of lotion on IMMEDIATELY once you get out the shower or bath.</li>
            <li> Good soap. Weird smell. The lotion smells like chocolate. This smells like musty chocolate.</li>
            <li> I need to order more as I am not sure what I will do if I run out haha. Great product, shipping, and all areas were perfect! Happy customer!</li>
            <li> Gave to my daughter for christmas, she has very dry skin and this will help replenish her natural oils. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell. It smells nothing like the lotion itself. It very very strong and heavy and made me dizzy. Also, it feels slimy when I washed with it. Will stick with the lotion.</li>
            <li> I found this soap pleasant but probably not worth the price.  It does have a &amp;#34;slimy&amp;#34; texture, but I actually found it felt good.  The odor is very similar to bitter chocolate--not unpleasant, but it may not be your cup of tea, and it tends to become unpleasant in areas of the body where sweat accumulates.</li>
            <li> this is what I use to clear the acne from my face- I was previously using Aveeno which was great for maintaining my skin and washing off makeup but not good for getting rid of pimples once they showed up. This soap has been a phenomenal replacement-it really helps keep my face radiant and acne free. I think what I appreciate the most is that it smooths the overall texture of your complexion along with getting rid of acne. I don&#x27;t use it on my body because it feels a little too heavy for my preference but for facial needs this soap is it</li>
            <li> My skin is prone to breakouts and I&#x27;m sensitive to soap smells.  This soap doesn&#x27;t irritate and keeps my skin soft and hydrated.  My acne even improved.  I love it!</li>
            <li> i love it, would not use any other soap again .i even use it on my face and my face feels smooth</li>
