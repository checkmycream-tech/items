            <li>product and great price.</li>
            <li>it looks very nice</li>
            <li>Does not look over bearing on my very fair skin, but gives me a nice glow when I use it to give me some color.</li>
            <li>and I loved it.</li>
            <li>but I love it!</li>
            <li>Good for fair to light skin.</li>
            <li>Also makes a nice eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li>it applies nicely...</li>
            <li>I would say its a good product for the price :)</li>
            <li>However if I use light strokes in the perimeter of my face it gives a very nice look.</li>
            <li>Feels very light on my skin and gives me a nice sun-kissed glow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very light skinned and use this one...</li>
            <li>but seriously it works beautiful :D</li>
            <li>and I love the color it gives</li>
            <li>and i love it .</li>
            <li>I love the shimmer in it &amp; with the lighter shade, it blends so well together.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>nevertheless still love it.</li>
            <li>Looks nice for light beach bronzer or if you want to lightly bronze your chest, shoulders or arms.</li>
            <li>I am fairly light skinned though, so anyone with darker Carmelly skin may love this.</li>
            <li>The stuff is amazing, highly recommend to anyone</li>
            <li>First Time trying this product and really love it.</li>
            <li>Would have been great if it was not so dark</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>its a basic bronzer..has a nice shimmer to it...</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>very pretty color :) Not to dark.</li>
            <li>Very shimmery.</li>
            <li>The color I got is much darker then the picture</li>
            <li>I really like this bronzer.  </li>
            <li>If you swirl your brush on the powder you&#x27;ll pick up waaaaay too much and make your face look like shimmering brown plastic.  </li>
            <li>I really like this bronzer...</li>
            <li>It goes on lightly, so you can reapply as you wish for a deep tan effect.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>But it doesnt stay on the whole day.</li>
            <li>I really like the color of this bronzer, and the fact that it does NOT make you look orange.</li>
            <li>I barely ever use it and when I do, it&#x27;s after I&#x27;ve consistently applied self tanner</li>
            <li>If you put it on light enough, you can&#x27;t see the shine though, so be careful.</li>
            <li>and even then I have to be careful and use it very sparingly.</li>
            <li>It gives a natural, not obvious makeup tan.</li>
            <li>but I have to be careful to use a light hand as its very dark for my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>It is very very sparkly and very very dark.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely for people who are very very very tan, or black.</li>
            <li>I like to take a large fluffy brush and just tap it once on the bronzer, then apply.  </li>

            <li> I have caramel skin and I actually use this as a highlighter. It&#x27;s beautiful! and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin looking ashy. This is my new favorite. I will definitely buy again and again. And it was only 3bucks!!</li>
            <li> Awesome bronzer ! Good for fair to light skin. Provides a a nice glow without making skin look dirty or orange.</li>
            <li> Shade is much to dark for my skin. Great quality. Found for alot cheaper at a different store. Very shimmery.</li>
            <li> I started using this a while back and then I started getting breakouts. So I stopped using it again. Now not to long ago I decided to try it again and I love the color it gives but it broke me out all over again.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase. The bronzer works great and when I wear it people ask if I have been tanning.</li>
            <li> I love this bronzer!!! i have a sephora bronzer and it works the same. I do retouch if i wear it all day but seriously it works beautiful :D&lt;br /&gt;It has shimmer , its not matte. and i love it .</li>
            <li> its a shade darker than my color so its perfect for a bronzer for my face. I love the shimmer in it &amp; with the lighter shade, it blends so well together.</li>

            <li> I really like this bronzer.  For the price, it&#x27;s one of the best I&#x27;ve used.  I usually grab a Physician&#x27;s Formula bronzer but I use a lot of other e.l.f. products so I thought I&#x27;d give this one a try.  I won&#x27;t be buying PF again!  I have a tan complexion but this bronzer needs to be used *sparingly*.  I like to take a large fluffy brush and just tap it once on the bronzer, then apply.  If you swirl your brush on the powder you&#x27;ll pick up waaaaay too much and make your face look like shimmering brown plastic.  Not cute.  The color is not orange at all, but a perfect brown tan.  Also makes a nice eyeshadow.  :)</li>

            <li> I think I might be allergic to this bronzer.</li>

            <li> Best bronzer I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> It gives a natural, not obvious makeup tan. One reviewer says that it has a shimmer, but mine doesn&#x27;t, in fact I don&#x27;t buy or use any makeup with sparkly glitter (I&#x27;m a guy).&lt;br /&gt;On my skin it blends beautifully, the color is perfect. It goes on lightly, so you can reapply as you wish for a deep tan effect.&lt;br /&gt;Good product and great price.</li>
            <li> First Time trying this product and really love it. But it doesnt stay on the whole day. nevertheless still love it.</li>

            <li> I really like the color of this bronzer, and the fact that it does NOT make you look orange. However, it does seem fake if you wear it everyday because of the shimmer.  It doesn&#x27;t look greasy, but just shiny. If you put it on light enough, you can&#x27;t see the shine though, so be careful. Looks nice for light beach bronzer or if you want to lightly bronze your chest, shoulders or arms.</li>
            <li> I bought this at target for only $1 and I loved it. It make my skin glow and doesn&#x27;t make it oily.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really show up unless you slather it on, but then it feels heavy.  Eh...</li>
