    <ol>
            <li>I had an excellent Panasonic trimmer, but I accidentally dropped it and broke it.</li>
            <li>Wahl makes some of the best trimmers out there.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the unit.</li>
            <li>Excellent for the price.</li>
            <li>I recommend the Hammacher Schlemmer \\&quot;best nose hair</li>
            <li>WITH CLAM SHELLS &amp; GREAT &lt;</li>
            <li>Either way it is a great clipper.  </li>
            <li>I have used wahl products for about 25 years now and have always been happy with their products.</li>
            <li>This product works great without pulling or shutting off.</li>
            <li>Does a great job on ear and nose hair.</li>
            <li>The design of the head make this a very effective product.</li>
            <li>I consider myself a great fan of Wahl products, having been being completely satisfied with their wonderful Groomsman and 5560-2101 Ear Nose and Brow Wet/Dry Head Trimmer.</li>
            <li>Nice!</li>
            <li>A good price at Amazon.</li>
            <li>This Wahl trimmer looks like a good deal, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>GOOD PRICE, MEDIOCURE PERFORMANCE.</li>
            <li>I bought Wahl 79524 26-Piece Deluxe Hair Clipper Kit and it is a great product.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is good but remember to charge your battery after use.</li>
            <li>Operates on one AA battery, very easy and very effective, a steal at this price.  </li>
            <li>The product was received in good condition, but as for how good the trimmer is - it is okay -</li>
            <li>He is very, very happy with the new one - great gift for a great price; arrived quickly; had it wrapped for Christmas before anything else!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I took it apart and the motor looks like a cheap motor from a toy in a happy meal.</li>
            <li>No pulling or pain of any kind.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this product is good for something, but trimming nose hairs isn&#x27;t one of them.</li>
            <li>Never thought I&#x27;d receive an item in that kind of shape from Amazon.</li>
            <li>This product is one of the best of its type I have used, and it was one of the most reasonable priced.</li>
            <li>Also, I can&#x27;t get it to trim ear hair very easily.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used this product I LOVED IT!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too impressed by it so far (after 2-3 uses).  </li>
            <li>But based on trimming, I&#x27;d have to say the Panasonic is the best I&#x27;ve used so far.  </li>
            <li>Two heads, one for trimming and one for more close work (nice for eyebrows, for instance).</li>
            <li>In fact, a deft hand can stylishly sculpt the hairs-trying to get it into a feather.</li>
            <li>This is the easiest and yet best functioning personal trimmer I have ever used.</li>
            <li>WORKS WELL; HOWEVER IT IS RATHER CHALLENGING</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>The quality &amp; power was much better than the Wahl, and the Panasonic trimmed better too.  </li>
            <li>Could not be happier! :)</li>
            <li>With experience, you will learn where most of the nose hairs are hiding and will be better able to target them.     </li>
            <li>I agree with the reviewer who said you&#x27;d be better off sticking a carrot up your nose.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Panasonic rotary clipper for many years until I dropped it and it died.  </li>
            <li>whatever is the reason, please go else where for a better trimmer.</li>
            <li>If I find a better one, I will update this note.</li>
            <li>I have another Panasonic trimmer, and while that one has hurt me, it does a much better job trimming.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li>Billing the product as anything more than</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>but okay.</li>
            <li>Love this trimmer.</li>
            <li>good product, price was right</li>
            <li>I guess that makes this trimmer pretty good.  </li>
            <li>This is a qucik and easy way to trim hose and ear hair away safely.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a \\&quot;personal trimmer\\&quot; (nice euphemism), this is a great one.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to clean and store.</li>
            <li>I own their plug-in electric hair groomer and it is powerful and well made.</li>
            <li>Easy clean, just rinse under water!  </li>
            <li>Easily trims all of those unsightly hairs without any pain or discomfort.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see so many good reviews.</li>
            <li>It works fine</li>
            <li>The trimmer part works fine.</li>
            <li>Tried the brow attachment just for the heck of it and seems to work fine</li>
            <li>Easy to use with one hand, easy to clean, trims great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>One genuine gripe, though: the included AA battery was cheap as cheap could be...</li>
            <li>Easy clean up.   </li>
            <li>I bought this because it was cheap, and a wet/dry.  </li>
            <li>To me the appliance does its primary job as well as anything does.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the way the pieces fit together as they fall off when not in use.</li>
            <li>This one has a lot of cheap plastic</li>
            <li>Its cheap and</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the important thing.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t very powerful but it trimmed the hairs</li>
            <li>It was great for the price, although the cleaning instructions of the product are not very clear.</li>
            <li>It cuts your hair clean with no pulling or cutter problems.</li>
            <li>I bought this item after reading so many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>As someone else suggested, a quick in-and-out movement chops the nose hairs cleanly and closely, with no skin irritation.  </li>
            <li>Item as described - quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Very impressed with this product, especially the low cost!</li>
            <li>But with the amazing minds out there, why can&#x27;t someone come up with a better way of trimming or eliminating nose &amp; ear hair without having to stick a razor sharp</li>
            <li>originally started by buying a Wahl nose hair trimmer, but it died pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s flimsy and its snap-on pieces aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;intuitive&amp;#34; and obvious or easy to snap on, but it&#x27;s serviceable, and I should not be expecting more for $10-11 (-ish).</li>
            <li>This is by far the better of the 4 trimmers.</li>
            <li>This product works great, the only con I have found is that it doesn&#x27;t trim as close as my old trimmer.  </li>
            <li>The plastic cover for the head got thrown away quickly as it rarely stayed on.</li>
            <li>The only annoyance is the battery cover, which slides off on its own from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In fairness to Wahl, I do own some other good Wahl trimmers, but this is definitely NOT one of them.  </li>
            <li>For whatever reason, I felt the other rotary designs would/should be superior, but they&#x27;re not.  </li>
            <li>Price versus quality intersect at the right point for us.</li>
            <li>Priced right.</li>
            <li>Overall great value for that super low price.</li>
            <li>looks a good quality article, I hope lasts pretty, components seem durable, I&#x27;ve used it several times that my nose hairs grow very fast, but very well cut my nose hairs</li>
            <li>Before I bought this item I looked at most of the reviews and was struck by the great differences of opinion over what is, after all, the same little appliance.</li>
            <li>But when you start the trimmer, it is easy to open the compartment by the light amount of force you exert on the body just to press the operating button to on with your thumb.</li>
            <li>no cutting the skin(only the hair), got all the hairs the first time.  </li>
            <li>Its huge &amp; not advisable to normal people.</li>
            <li>Both are detachable so they can be rinsed, though the whole gizmo stays pretty clean in use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also quiet and cleans easily!</li>
            <li>18 months of use (and only using it twice a month at the very most), I expected to get more out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was delivered promptly, very reasonably priced and it does the job.  </li>
            <li>I admit I got this rather on speculation because I was hoping it would provide a quick and easy solution to a woman&#x27;s occasional lip or chin hair.</li>
            <li>It fits comfortably in my hand, isn&#x27;t heavy, is easy to clean and it cuts the hairs.  </li>
            <li>The quality was sub-par, and the top would constantly pop off, so when it died I decided to try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mangroomer was only used 1 more time and now sits in a toiletry bag.</li>
            <li>First Walh I had didn&#x27;t pull, either.</li>
            <li>The Wahl Personal Trimmer is better than nothing.  </li>
            <li>Although it is designed with a rotary blade for nose and ears, its external shape and engineering removes hairs more efficiently.</li>
            <li>It is also covered in some substance that is like tar on a hot day.  </li>
            <li>The basic unit is an okay nose hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t currently see anything else on Amazon which has received good enough</li>
            <li>Is small and is a good brand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had good service with Wahl products in the past.</li>
            <li>You can only use the sides of the trimmer to trim instead of the top on so many other trimmers.      </li>
            <li>only thing I don&#x27;t like is the cover of the battery, slides easily when you use the trimmer.</li>
            <li>nice item for the price, a little noisy.</li>
            <li>CHANGING HEADS &amp; I AM VERY MECHANICALLY INCLINED.</li>
            <li>After much trying, I&#x27;ve given up and consider my $10 lost.</li>
            <li>Besides not working, the cap doesn&#x27;t fit properly, the battery cover keeps sliding off and the overall construction is cheap.</li>
            <li>The trimmer does not cut hair very close to the skin --</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really need the reciprocating head.</li>
            <li>The rotary head works very well</li>
            <li>Well, I can tell you that this trimmer is not something anyone who wants a close trim should buy.  </li>
            <li>It only costs a few dollars more than this Wahl and it trims so much better.</li>
            <li>Really a value.</li>
            <li>It works OK but not what I expected.  </li>
            <li>I gave this as a Christmas present to my husband to replace an old Wahl trimmer that he had had for many years.</li>
            <li>In fairness to Wahl, I do use some of their other products and am reasonably satisfied with them.</li>
            <li>Is this one unique or different?  </li>
            <li>Before you purchase this look at the other reviews of Wahl 5560 as well to better inform yourself.</li>
            <li>Have used other Wahl products over the years and have been pleased with the suitability of the products for the intended purpose.</li>
            <li>Well, I wish I had switched a long time ago, because this one is pain free.  </li>
            <li>The same is true of sideburns.</li>
            <li>and I would most likely purchase the same brand again.</li>
            <li>I had an older Wahl unit that eventually failed/wore out.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this tool.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li>While this has a better quality motor, drive, and head design than my old Wahl whoever designed the handle needs to find other work.  </li>
            <li>I replaced it with a decent new brand-name AA battery from a pack we have on-hand, and, viola - doctor, I&#x27;m cured -</li>
            <li>LOOKS GOOD, WORKS POORLY.</li>
            <li>Easy to change heads,  Small and handy size,  The battery doesnt last for a long time.  </li>
            <li>This item was not anywhere near New, it was very USED.</li>
            <li>Have had excellent experience with two previous Panasonic models which have since broken.  </li>
            <li>The packaging was difficult to open, and the battery cover does come off if you&#x27;re not careful when you turn it on, but I&#x27;m very happy with the results after having used it three times now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is cheaply made foreign junk with the Wahl name stamped on it.</li>
            <li>(I purchased this trimmer to replace a very old \\&quot;Lewis N Clark\\&quot; AA-battery operated trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I read back then about other people having problems with water or rust, or something like that, so I always made sure to blow any access water out after cleaning it.</li>
            <li>One great feature is you can wash the cutting head when finished.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s quiet, powerful enough and does a great job of cutting those wiry nose hairs quite closely.  </li>
            <li>and they still prefered their old trimmer over this one.</li>
            <li>I had to resort to using my old trimmers to get the job done.  </li>
            <li>Ordered to replace a 10 year old Wahl.  </li>
            <li>I have no complaints about this product so far.</li>
            <li>But, when after many years of use, the 5560-2101 began run slowly I decided to replace it with this 5545-506.</li>
            <li>The actual hair and eyebrow trimmers are a joke, both being too flimsy and small to be even marginally effective for anyone larger than a GI Joe doll.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It really is hard to find products suitable for women&#x27;s facial hair</li>
            <li>The cutter actually did a decent job, for a week or two.</li>
            <li>This has been easy enough to use that my husband actually uses it on himself rather than chasing me down to trim him.</li>
            <li>The quality is similar to the Panasonic, but it doesn&#x27;t cut nearly as well.  </li>
            <li>Back to the razors designed for young men I guess.</li>
            <li>I went back to an old cleaner.</li>
            <li>It seems to me that much of the divergence of opinion is due to differences in expectations of the purchasers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Incidentally, applying a few drops of oil near the shaft of my quite old 5560-2101 made it run like new again.</li>
            <li>I use mainly the rotary and it works just as expected.     </li>
            <li>OK, I know the subject is a little gross and one we guys would rather not talk about, but, hey, those little hairs in the nose and ears begin to take over once we get to a certain age, and eventually scissors</li>
            <li>previously used a small scizzors, this is an order of magnitude better.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is quiet and does not snag hairs, but it also barely cuts any hair.  </li>
            <li>Instead, I stored it in an open place where the blades wouldn&#x27;t get damaged, and any moisture left behind would still be able to dissipate.</li>
            <li>I find it much safer than using small scissors near my eyes.</li>

            <li> I own their plug-in electric hair groomer and it is powerful and well made.</li>
            <li> Easy clean, just rinse under water!  </li>
            <li> Easily trims all of those unsightly hairs without any pain or discomfort.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see so many good reviews.</li>
            <li> It works fine</li>
            <li> The trimmer part works fine.</li>
            <li> Tried the brow attachment just for the heck of it and seems to work fine</li>
            <li> Easy to use with one hand, easy to clean, trims great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> One genuine gripe, though: the included AA battery was cheap as cheap could be...</li>
            <li> Easy clean up.   </li>
            <li> I bought this because it was cheap, and a wet/dry.  </li>
            <li> To me the appliance does its primary job as well as anything does.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the way the pieces fit together as they fall off when not in use.</li>
            <li> This one has a lot of cheap plastic</li>
            <li> Its cheap and</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the important thing.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t very powerful but it trimmed the hairs</li>
            <li> It was great for the price, although the cleaning instructions of the product are not very clear.</li>
            <li> It cuts your hair clean with no pulling or cutter problems.</li>
            <li> I bought this item after reading so many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> As someone else suggested, a quick in-and-out movement chops the nose hairs cleanly and closely, with no skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> Item as described - quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with this product, especially the low cost!</li>
            <li> But with the amazing minds out there, why can&#x27;t someone come up with a better way of trimming or eliminating nose &amp; ear hair without having to stick a razor sharp</li>
            <li> originally started by buying a Wahl nose hair trimmer, but it died pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s flimsy and its snap-on pieces aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;intuitive&amp;#34; and obvious or easy to snap on, but it&#x27;s serviceable, and I should not be expecting more for $10-11 (-ish).</li>
            <li> This is by far the better of the 4 trimmers.</li>
            <li> This product works great, the only con I have found is that it doesn&#x27;t trim as close as my old trimmer.  </li>
            <li> The plastic cover for the head got thrown away quickly as it rarely stayed on.</li>
            <li> The only annoyance is the battery cover, which slides off on its own from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In fairness to Wahl, I do own some other good Wahl trimmers, but this is definitely NOT one of them.  </li>
            <li> For whatever reason, I felt the other rotary designs would/should be superior, but they&#x27;re not.  </li>
            <li> Price versus quality intersect at the right point for us.</li>
            <li> Priced right.</li>
            <li> Overall great value for that super low price.</li>
            <li> looks a good quality article, I hope lasts pretty, components seem durable, I&#x27;ve used it several times that my nose hairs grow very fast, but very well cut my nose hairs</li>
            <li> Before I bought this item I looked at most of the reviews and was struck by the great differences of opinion over what is, after all, the same little appliance.</li>
            <li> But when you start the trimmer, it is easy to open the compartment by the light amount of force you exert on the body just to press the operating button to on with your thumb.</li>
            <li> no cutting the skin(only the hair), got all the hairs the first time.  </li>
            <li> Its huge &amp; not advisable to normal people.</li>
            <li> Both are detachable so they can be rinsed, though the whole gizmo stays pretty clean in use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also quiet and cleans easily!</li>
            <li> 18 months of use (and only using it twice a month at the very most), I expected to get more out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was delivered promptly, very reasonably priced and it does the job.  </li>
            <li> I admit I got this rather on speculation because I was hoping it would provide a quick and easy solution to a woman&#x27;s occasional lip or chin hair.</li>
            <li> It fits comfortably in my hand, isn&#x27;t heavy, is easy to clean and it cuts the hairs.  </li>
            <li> The quality was sub-par, and the top would constantly pop off, so when it died I decided to try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mangroomer was only used 1 more time and now sits in a toiletry bag.</li>
            <li> First Walh I had didn&#x27;t pull, either.</li>
            <li> The Wahl Personal Trimmer is better than nothing.  </li>
            <li> Although it is designed with a rotary blade for nose and ears, its external shape and engineering removes hairs more efficiently.</li>
            <li> It is also covered in some substance that is like tar on a hot day.  </li>
            <li> The basic unit is an okay nose hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t currently see anything else on Amazon which has received good enough</li>
            <li> Is small and is a good brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had good service with Wahl products in the past.</li>
            <li> You can only use the sides of the trimmer to trim instead of the top on so many other trimmers.      </li>
            <li> only thing I don&#x27;t like is the cover of the battery, slides easily when you use the trimmer.</li>
            <li> nice item for the price, a little noisy.</li>
            <li> CHANGING HEADS &amp; I AM VERY MECHANICALLY INCLINED.</li>
            <li> After much trying, I&#x27;ve given up and consider my $10 lost.</li>
            <li> Besides not working, the cap doesn&#x27;t fit properly, the battery cover keeps sliding off and the overall construction is cheap.</li>
            <li> The trimmer does not cut hair very close to the skin --</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really need the reciprocating head.</li>
            <li> The rotary head works very well</li>
            <li> Well, I can tell you that this trimmer is not something anyone who wants a close trim should buy.  </li>
            <li> It only costs a few dollars more than this Wahl and it trims so much better.</li>
            <li> Really a value.</li>
            <li> It works OK but not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I gave this as a Christmas present to my husband to replace an old Wahl trimmer that he had had for many years.</li>
            <li> In fairness to Wahl, I do use some of their other products and am reasonably satisfied with them.</li>
            <li> Is this one unique or different?  </li>
            <li> Before you purchase this look at the other reviews of Wahl 5560 as well to better inform yourself.</li>
            <li> Have used other Wahl products over the years and have been pleased with the suitability of the products for the intended purpose.</li>
            <li> Well, I wish I had switched a long time ago, because this one is pain free.  </li>
            <li> The same is true of sideburns.</li>
            <li> and I would most likely purchase the same brand again.</li>
            <li> I had an older Wahl unit that eventually failed/wore out.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this tool.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> While this has a better quality motor, drive, and head design than my old Wahl whoever designed the handle needs to find other work.  </li>
            <li> I replaced it with a decent new brand-name AA battery from a pack we have on-hand, and, viola - doctor, I&#x27;m cured -</li>
            <li> LOOKS GOOD, WORKS POORLY.</li>
            <li> Easy to change heads,  Small and handy size,  The battery doesnt last for a long time.  </li>
            <li> This item was not anywhere near New, it was very USED.</li>
            <li> Have had excellent experience with two previous Panasonic models which have since broken.  </li>
            <li> The packaging was difficult to open, and the battery cover does come off if you&#x27;re not careful when you turn it on, but I&#x27;m very happy with the results after having used it three times now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is cheaply made foreign junk with the Wahl name stamped on it.</li>
            <li> (I purchased this trimmer to replace a very old \\&quot;Lewis N Clark\\&quot; AA-battery operated trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I read back then about other people having problems with water or rust, or something like that, so I always made sure to blow any access water out after cleaning it.</li>
            <li> One great feature is you can wash the cutting head when finished.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s quiet, powerful enough and does a great job of cutting those wiry nose hairs quite closely.  </li>
            <li> and they still prefered their old trimmer over this one.</li>
            <li> I had to resort to using my old trimmers to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> Ordered to replace a 10 year old Wahl.  </li>
            <li> I have no complaints about this product so far.</li>
            <li> But, when after many years of use, the 5560-2101 began run slowly I decided to replace it with this 5545-506.</li>
            <li> The actual hair and eyebrow trimmers are a joke, both being too flimsy and small to be even marginally effective for anyone larger than a GI Joe doll.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It really is hard to find products suitable for women&#x27;s facial hair</li>
            <li> The cutter actually did a decent job, for a week or two.</li>
            <li> This has been easy enough to use that my husband actually uses it on himself rather than chasing me down to trim him.</li>
            <li> The quality is similar to the Panasonic, but it doesn&#x27;t cut nearly as well.  </li>
            <li> Back to the razors designed for young men I guess.</li>
            <li> I went back to an old cleaner.</li>
            <li> It seems to me that much of the divergence of opinion is due to differences in expectations of the purchasers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Incidentally, applying a few drops of oil near the shaft of my quite old 5560-2101 made it run like new again.</li>
            <li> I use mainly the rotary and it works just as expected.     </li>
            <li> OK, I know the subject is a little gross and one we guys would rather not talk about, but, hey, those little hairs in the nose and ears begin to take over once we get to a certain age, and eventually scissors</li>
            <li> previously used a small scizzors, this is an order of magnitude better.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is quiet and does not snag hairs, but it also barely cuts any hair.  </li>
            <li> Instead, I stored it in an open place where the blades wouldn&#x27;t get damaged, and any moisture left behind would still be able to dissipate.</li>
            <li> I find it much safer than using small scissors near my eyes.</li>
            <li> Other than that, if $10-11 is all you have to spend on such an item, then, this is okay - not great -</li>
            <li> and yet it&#x27;s a pretty common problem.</li>
            <li> Even after careful insertions and re-inserions, it inevitably cut next to nothing at all.  </li>
            <li> One of the frustrating issues is snapping the plastic cover back on, it has to be in just the right position.</li>
            <li> (However, by holding the handle with one hand and sliding the switch with the other hand, this can be avoided -- but that should not be necessary if the product was properly engineered and manufactured.)    </li>
            <li> I am suspicious of all these hyper positive reviews and unhappy i&#x27;ve wasted money on a cheap product.</li>
            <li> see how long the Mangroomer lasts.  </li>
            <li> The Wahl has worked as expected for several years now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terrible, but it&#x27;s bad enough that I decided to write this review for the 3 trimmers I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could spend an hour using this Wahl to trim the hair, or I can spend 5 minutes with the Panasonic being careful.</li>
            <li> I am not saying not to buy them, just be careful.</li>
            <li> This is certainly not upto the mark.</li>
            <li> The On/Off button was not strong and ultimately fell off</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used this to trim a few long eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> Obviously, I&#x27;m still pretty disappointed that it didn&#x27;t last longer though.  </li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco cuts just as close as any of other trimmers, it has never pulled one hair, and its never cut me</li>
            <li> Before buying this product, I read a number of reviews of this one and other ones.  </li>
            <li> but I am not sure of the value of the second head.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not made in the USA like some other Wahl products.</li>
            <li> quieter than my previous one that I had, and works as expected.</li>
            <li> it worked - so I know it was a cheap, bad battery.</li>
            <li> It just glided over the skin and, while it did no damage and wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable, it really didn&#x27;t do anything about hair removal</li>
            <li> If I go slow enough, it&#x27;ll cut the hairs.  </li>
            <li> It also comes with an attachment for use on your eyebrows/sideburns/mustache, or any other narrow area of hair.     </li>
            <li> Not very strong.</li>
            <li> But I was pretty disappointed that it only lasted about a year and a half before it died as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (most of the time) blade up your nostril that is spinning at mind boggling speeds and hoping and praying that \\&quot;this time\\&quot; a hair won&#x27;t get brutally ripped out causing extreme pain?  </li>
            <li> ALTHOUGH A LITTLE NOISY</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of nose hair but what little I did felt like it was being pulled out from the roots.</li>
            <li> Then started having trouble with the little motor, wouldn&#x27;t turn or cut.</li>
            <li> After the 1st few uses it never had that issue again    </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this nose trimmer is not of the same quality.</li>
            <li> Not really sure how you rate a nose hair trimmer</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull your nose hair, or at least, it hasn&#x27;t pulled mine...</li>
            <li> If you have used these things before, you know that they are slow.</li>
            <li> No more tickling of the nose hairs!!</li>
            <li> Also, the cutter is next to worthless for removing ear hairs that grow along to rim of the ear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> As delivered to me the battery cover was covered with a sticky mess that I found very difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> Unlike a number of other Wahl-brand products that I have used over the years, I was disappointed by this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this trimmer is no longer being sold.)</li>
            <li> I think I ordered the wrong item because it didn&#x27;t work like I thought.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a clipper blade for cutting ear/sideburns/eyebrow hair, so you get two blades for the price of one.  </li>
            <li> i ordered a wahl 5545 56 &amp; was unhappy with it.  </li>
            <li> I found this product absolutely useless!  </li>
            <li> Both PULL badly sometimes.</li>
            <li> But this trimmer is absolutely bad.</li>
            <li> DISAPPOINTED IN THIS ITEM.</li>
            <li> I hated using it because it was very painful to use, pulling the hair out in my nose.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s terrible!</li>
            <li> It had scratches and scuffs, but that&#x27;s not even the worst part.</li>
            <li> Nasty, nasty, stuff.</li>
            <li> For myself, it was an awful</li>
            <li> It does a terrible job of trimming.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Item as described - quick delivery.</li>
            <li> This is the easiest and yet best functioning personal trimmer I have ever used. And it is also realy inexpensive. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I needed one of these, read the reviews and ordered it.  It was delivered promptly, very reasonably priced and it does the job.  The packaging was difficult to open, and the battery cover does come off if you&#x27;re not careful when you turn it on, but I&#x27;m very happy with the results after having used it three times now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend purchasing this trimmer if you&#x27;re in need of one.  It fits comfortably in my hand, isn&#x27;t heavy, is easy to clean and it cuts the hairs.  As someone else suggested, a quick in-and-out movement chops the nose hairs cleanly and closely, with no skin irritation.  I&#x27;ve also used this to trim a few long eyebrows.  I find it much safer than using small scissors near my eyes.</li>
            <li> Easy to change heads,  Small and handy size,  The battery doesnt last for a long time.  Easy clean up.   A good price at Amazon.</li>
            <li> It was great for the price, although the cleaning instructions of the product are not very clear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Panasonic nose and ear hair trimmer for years.  I hated using it because it was very painful to use, pulling the hair out in my nose.  Well, it finally died so I decided to try a different brand, this Wahl.  Well, I wish I had switched a long time ago, because this one is pain free.  No pulling or pain of any kind.  It still tickles and makes my eyes water, but ZERO PAIN.  Love it!</li>
            <li> WORKS WELL; HOWEVER IT IS RATHER CHALLENGING CHANGING HEADS &amp; I AM VERY MECHANICALLY INCLINED. SHAVES WELL, ALTHOUGH A LITTLE NOISY AS THEY ALL ARE.</li>
            <li> Not very strong. Did not cut well! Broke after short term use! The On/Off button was not strong and ultimately fell off</li>
            <li> *UPDATED below*&lt;br /&gt;I originally started by buying a Wahl nose hair trimmer, but it died pretty quickly.  It wasn&#x27;t very powerful but it trimmed the hairs okay.  The quality was sub-par, and the top would constantly pop off, so when it died I decided to try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, I bought the Panasonic Panasonic ER421KC trimmer.  The quality &amp; power was much better than the Wahl, and the Panasonic trimmed better too.  But I was pretty disappointed that it only lasted about a year and a half before it died as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of months ago I bought the Mangroomer nose hair trimmer.  The quality is similar to the Panasonic, but it doesn&#x27;t cut nearly as well.  If I go slow enough, it&#x27;ll cut the hairs.  Otherwise, the Mangroomer likes to pull hairs.  I&#x27;m not too impressed by it so far (after 2-3 uses).  It&#x27;s not terrible, but it&#x27;s bad enough that I decided to write this review for the 3 trimmers I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll see how long the Mangroomer lasts.  But based on trimming, I&#x27;d have to say the Panasonic is the best I&#x27;ve used so far.  Obviously, I&#x27;m still pretty disappointed that it didn&#x27;t last longer though.  After only +/- 18 months of use (and only using it twice a month at the very most), I expected to get more out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to try something else (if / when the Mangroomer dies) but I don&#x27;t currently see anything else on Amazon which has received good enough reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE*&lt;br /&gt;The Mangroomer was only used 1 more time and now sits in a toiletry bag. I have no idea if it still works or not, and have no desire to ever try it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;ve had the Philips Norelco NT9110 for about 2 years, and recently remembered my prior review/s, so I decided to update them. This is by far the better of the 4 trimmers. I read back then about other people having problems with water or rust, or something like that, so I always made sure to blow any access water out after cleaning it. I also never put the cap backon. Instead, I stored it in an open place where the blades wouldn&#x27;t get damaged, and any moisture left behind would still be able to dissipate. I&#x27;ve never had a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had noticed this trimmer before, but something about the design turned me away from buying it.  For whatever reason, I felt the other rotary designs would/should be superior, but they&#x27;re not.  The Philips Norelco cuts just as close as any of other trimmers, it has never pulled one hair, and its never cut me (which was a concern with this design, and I&#x27;ve jammed/pushed it into any areas as needed).  If something ever happens to it, I&#x27;ll be buying this one again.  I hope this is helpful to someone.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product I LOVED IT!  No pulling, no cutting the skin(only the hair), got all the hairs the first time.  No more tickling of the nose hairs!! Easy clean, just rinse under water!  Could not be happier! :)</li>
            <li> Before buying this product, I read a number of reviews of this one and other ones.  I bought this because it was cheap, and a wet/dry.  It doesn&#x27;t pull your nose hair, or at least, it hasn&#x27;t pulled mine...yet.  But in all, it was a solid buy. It does the job.</li>
            <li> This product works great, the only con I have found is that it doesn&#x27;t trim as close as my old trimmer.  I would definately recommend this to people.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this item I looked at most of the reviews and was struck by the great differences of opinion over what is, after all, the same little appliance. It seems to me that much of the divergence of opinion is due to differences in expectations of the purchasers. If you have used these things before, you know that they are slow. You cannot see the nose hairs and have to wave the cutter head around in your nose for a while to get the job done. With experience, you will learn where most of the nose hairs are hiding and will be better able to target them.     Also, the cutter is next to worthless for removing ear hairs that grow along to rim of the ear. Use a razor. The same is true of sideburns. To me the appliance does its primary job as well as anything does.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a Christmas present to my husband to replace an old Wahl trimmer that he had had for many years. He is very, very happy with the new one - great gift for a great price; arrived quickly; had it wrapped for Christmas before anything else!</li>
            <li> This is certainly not upto the mark. Its huge &amp; not advisable to normal people. It heats up so soon &amp; doesnt trim nose hair well.</li>
            <li> This unit has not worked well for me. After much trying, I&#x27;ve given up and consider my $10 lost. Besides not working, the cap doesn&#x27;t fit properly, the battery cover keeps sliding off and the overall construction is cheap.</li>
            <li> This Wahl Nose Trimmer does not work at all.  It does not trim any nose hair.  Have had excellent experience with two previous Panasonic models which have since broken.  In fairness to Wahl, I do use some of their other products and am reasonably satisfied with them.</li>
            <li> This product is one of the best of its type I have used, and it was one of the most reasonable priced. It cuts your hair clean with no pulling or cutter problems. It also comes with a clipper blade for cutting ear/sideburns/eyebrow hair, so you get two blades for the price of one.  One great feature is you can wash the cutting head when finished. It has a two year warranty. &lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this tool.</li>
            <li> I needed this ! &lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the cover of the battery, slides easily when you use the trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this product is good for something, but trimming nose hairs isn&#x27;t one of them. You might as well stick a carrot in your nose; you&#x27;ll get essentially the same result. I had an excellent Panasonic trimmer, but I accidentally dropped it and broke it. This Wahl trimmer looks like a good deal, but you get what you pay for. I decided to toss it and buy another Panasonic.</li>
            <li> It arrived within the estimated time frame I received. It works well and I had no problems with the company.</li>
            <li> Easily trims all of those unsightly hairs without any pain or discomfort. It&#x27;s also quiet and cleans easily!</li>
            <li> I admit I got this rather on speculation because I was hoping it would provide a quick and easy solution to a woman&#x27;s occasional lip or chin hair. It didn&#x27;t work at all for that. It just glided over the skin and, while it did no damage and wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable, it really didn&#x27;t do anything about hair removal either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really is hard to find products suitable for women&#x27;s facial hair and yet it&#x27;s a pretty common problem. Ah well. Back to the razors designed for young men I guess.</li>
            <li> This thing does it&#x27;s job.  But with the amazing minds out there, why can&#x27;t someone come up with a better way of trimming or eliminating nose &amp; ear hair without having to stick a razor sharp (most of the time) blade up your nostril that is spinning at mind boggling speeds and hoping and praying that \\&quot;this time\\&quot; a hair won&#x27;t get brutally ripped out causing extreme pain?  Wahl makes some of the best trimmers out there.  Is this one unique or different?  No.  It&#x27;s just another ear &amp; nose hair trimmer.  It works fine and I would most likely purchase the same brand again.</li>
            <li> The product was received in good condition, but as for how good the trimmer is - it is okay - I gave it as a gift and they still prefered their old trimmer over this one.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with this product, especially the low cost!</li>
            <li> GOOD PRICE, MEDIOCURE PERFORMANCE. LOOKS GOOD, WORKS POORLY. &lt;br /&gt;VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS ITEM. MAYBE IT&#x27;S LACK OF POWER IS &lt;br /&gt;CUZ&#x27; THERE&#x27;S ONLY ONE BATTERY, BUT...NEXT TIME I&#x27;LL JUST DEAL &lt;br /&gt;WITH NOSE HAIRS (THE CROWD SCREAMS!) WITH CLAM SHELLS &amp; GREAT &lt;br /&gt;BRAVERY.</li>
            <li> I had an older Wahl unit that eventually failed/wore out. Blade broke I think. So I bought the Panasonic one. Actually two of them - the cheapest and the most expensive. Both worked the same. Both PULL badly sometimes. OUCH. Went back to Wahl. This unit NEVER pulls, it just cuts. First Walh I had didn&#x27;t pull, either. It&#x27;s slower to use than the Panasonic, but I&#x27;m not into pain. I&#x27;m very happy with the unit.</li>
            <li> Unlike a number of other Wahl-brand products that I have used over the years, I was disappointed by this trimmer.  Specifically,     (a) The trimmer does not cut hair very close to the skin -- about 1/8\\&quot; of hair is left, so instead of looking \\&quot;clean\\&quot; when you are done, trimmed areas look \\&quot;fuzzy\\&quot;.      (b) The battery compartment cover is on the underside of the handle.  Using one hand, when the switch is pushed forward to the \\&quot;on\\&quot; position, the battery cover pops off in the opposite direction.  This is the only personal care product that I have ever owned that automatically disassembles itself when it is turned on.  (However, by holding the handle with one hand and sliding the switch with the other hand, this can be avoided -- but that should not be necessary if the product was properly engineered and manufactured.)    Based on my experience with this trimmer, I do NOT recommend it.    (I purchased this trimmer to replace a very old \\&quot;Lewis N Clark\\&quot; AA-battery operated trimmer.  Unfortunately, this trimmer is no longer being sold.)</li>
            <li> The Wahl Personal Trimmer is better than nothing.  But it doesn&#x27;t trim nose hairs well at all.  I agree with the reviewer who said you&#x27;d be better off sticking a carrot up your nose.  Also, I can&#x27;t get it to trim ear hair very easily.  I&#x27;m not happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> OK, I know the subject is a little gross and one we guys would rather not talk about, but, hey, those little hairs in the nose and ears begin to take over once we get to a certain age, and eventually scissors just don&#x27;t cut it (har har). If you&#x27;re looking for a \\&quot;personal trimmer\\&quot; (nice euphemism), this is a great one. Two heads, one for trimming and one for more close work (nice for eyebrows, for instance). Both are detachable so they can be rinsed, though the whole gizmo stays pretty clean in use (well, mine does, I can&#x27;t vouch for your personal hygiene). Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do leaving the rhyno pilla in bowed submission. In fact, a deft hand can stylishly sculpt the hairs-trying to get it into a feather.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00068J2QE Wahl 5545-506 Dual Head Wet/Dry Personal Trimmer]] I found this product absolutely useless!  Even after careful insertions and re-inserions, it inevitably cut next to nothing at all.  I had to resort to using my old trimmers to get the job done.  Do yourself a favor - DON&#x27;T buy this piece of junk!  I&#x27;ve since purchased the Norelco NT9110 - it&#x27;s quiet, powerful enough and does a great job of cutting those wiry nose hairs quite closely.  In fairness to Wahl, I do own some other good Wahl trimmers, but this is definitely NOT one of them.  Trust me on this, gentlemen - it&#x27;s terrible!</li>
            <li> nice item for the price, a little noisy. Recommended</li>
            <li> The trimmer part works fine. The problem is the design of the trimmer. The battery compartment is on the handle where your fingers wrap around the trimmer while starting and in use. But when you start the trimmer, it is easy to open the compartment by the light amount of force you exert on the body just to press the operating button to on with your thumb. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I guess duct tape would work.</li>
            <li> Excellent for the price. Tried the brow attachment just for the heck of it and seems to work fine but I don&#x27;t really need the reciprocating head. I use mainly the rotary and it works just as expected.     Only issue I found was that the power button didn&#x27;t click into place initially so it would shut off during use. After the 1st few uses it never had that issue again    Overall great value for that super low price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Panasonic rotary clipper for many years until I dropped it and it died.  I thought I&#x27;d try the Wahl because is has the dual head. The rotary head works very well but I am not sure of the value of the second head.  Either way it is a great clipper.  One of the frustrating issues is snapping the plastic cover back on, it has to be in just the right position.</li>
            <li> I bought this item after reading so many positive reviews.  Well, I can tell you that this trimmer is not something anyone who wants a close trim should buy.  The trimmer is quiet and does not snag hairs, but it also barely cuts any hair.  You can only use the sides of the trimmer to trim instead of the top on so many other trimmers.      I recommend the Hammacher Schlemmer \\&quot;best nose hair trimmer.\\&quot;  It only costs a few dollars more than this Wahl and it trims so much better.</li>
            <li> This item was not anywhere near New, it was very USED. I didn&#x27;t even have to open the packaging to realize it. It had scratches and scuffs, but that&#x27;s not even the worst part. There was HAIR inside of the packaging from the last person who used it! Nasty, nasty, stuff. I promptly returned it. Never thought I&#x27;d receive an item in that kind of shape from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see so many good reviews. For myself, it was an awful &lt;br /&gt;product. I bought Wahl 79524 26-Piece Deluxe Hair Clipper Kit and it is a great product. But this trimmer is absolutely bad. I had to struggle to trim the hair. May be it did not had enough of horse power - whatever is the reason, please go else where for a better trimmer. If I find a better one, I will update this note.</li>
            <li> The design of the head make this a very effective product. Although it is designed with a rotary blade for nose and ears, its external shape and engineering removes hairs more efficiently. In addition this comes with a reciprocating blade attachment for side burns, mustaches, etc. Really a value.</li>
            <li> The Wahl has worked as expected for several years now. The plastic cover for the head got thrown away quickly as it rarely stayed on. The only annoyance is the battery cover, which slides off on its own from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If mine broke tomorrow I would buy another.</li>
            <li> This is a very low quality trimmer. It&#x27;s not made in the USA like some other Wahl products. It does a terrible job of trimming. I have another Panasonic trimmer, and while that one has hurt me, it does a much better job trimming. I could spend an hour using this Wahl to trim the hair, or I can spend 5 minutes with the Panasonic being careful.</li>
            <li> i ordered a wahl 5545 56 &amp; was unhappy with it.  it fell apart and did not shave well. i want an adjustmnen. al davis</li>
            <li> WARNING. Before you purchase this look at the other reviews of Wahl 5560 as well to better inform yourself. I purchased this product because of the Wahl name. I own their plug-in electric hair groomer and it is powerful and well made. Unfortunately, this nose trimmer is not of the same quality. It is cheaply made foreign junk with the Wahl name stamped on it. The cutter actually did a decent job, for a week or two. Then started having trouble with the little motor, wouldn&#x27;t turn or cut. I took it apart and the motor looks like a cheap motor from a toy in a happy meal. Waste of money. I am suspicious of all these hyper positive reviews and unhappy i&#x27;ve wasted money on a cheap product. I was very disappointed. Caveat emptor. os</li>
            <li> Have used other Wahl products over the years and have been pleased with the suitability of the products for the intended purpose. Price versus quality intersect at the right point for us. This has been easy enough to use that my husband actually uses it on himself rather than chasing me down to trim him. Nice!</li>
            <li> I have used wahl products for about 25 years now and have always been happy with their products. This is a qucik and easy way to trim hose and ear hair away safely.</li>
            <li> quieter than my previous one that I had, and works as expected.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is good but remember to charge your battery after use. Is small and is a good brand. Wahl</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK but I don&#x27;t think I would order it again.  It works OK but not what I expected.  I don&#x27;t like the way the pieces fit together as they fall off when not in use.</li>
            <li> I went back to an old cleaner. This one has a lot of cheap plastic</li>
            <li> I consider myself a great fan of Wahl products, having been being completely satisfied with their wonderful Groomsman and 5560-2101 Ear Nose and Brow Wet/Dry Head Trimmer. But, when after many years of use, the 5560-2101 began run slowly I decided to replace it with this 5545-506. It was a big mistake. This clipper stalls under the lightest of loads. As delivered to me the battery cover was covered with a sticky mess that I found very difficult to remove. In addition, it kept falling off. I would definitely not recommend this model to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incidentally, applying a few drops of oil near the shaft of my quite old 5560-2101 made it run like new again.</li>
            <li> good product, price was right</li>
            <li> This product works great without pulling or shutting off. Stay away from the trim designs that lack power. Would buy this again</li>
            <li> Battery door will not lock</li>
            <li> Operates on one AA battery, very easy and very effective, a steal at this price.  previously used a small scizzors, this is an order of magnitude better.</li>
            <li> This unit is well built and it works well.  No pinching or pulling, and it gets all the hair you can see.</li>
            <li> I think I ordered the wrong item because it didn&#x27;t work like I thought. I don&#x27;t have a lot of nose hair but what little I did felt like it was being pulled out from the roots. I thought it was me but no it was the trimmers. I am not saying not to buy them, just be careful.</li>
            <li> Ordered to replace a 10 year old Wahl.  While this has a better quality motor, drive, and head design than my old Wahl whoever designed the handle needs to find other work.  The one side of the handle is the battery cover that will not stay on.  It is also covered in some substance that is like tar on a hot day.  A guess would be someone thought making a handle that comes off multiple times when using their product should stick to your fingers AND leave your fingers sticky.  Will return as it is practically not usable.</li>
            <li> This product&#x27;s so-called \\&quot;dual heads\\&quot; are shown in a scale that is totally misleading.  The actual hair and eyebrow trimmers are a joke, both being too flimsy and small to be even marginally effective for anyone larger than a GI Joe doll.  The basic unit is an okay nose hair trimmer.  Billing the product as anything more than that is bogus.</li>
            <li> looks a good quality article, I hope lasts pretty, components seem durable, I&#x27;ve used it several times that my nose hairs grow very fast, but very well cut my nose hairs</li>
            <li> The trimmer works well with trimming nose hair. It also comes with an attachment for use on your eyebrows/sideburns/mustache, or any other narrow area of hair.     I have yet to have one pulled hair. It is very easy to clean and store. I have no complaints about this product so far.</li>
            <li> Not really sure how you rate a nose hair trimmer - it cuts all the hair and it hasn&#x27;t pinched me once in 4 or so months I have had it, so I guess that makes this trimmer pretty good.  It is very quiet (to the point where some may think it lacks power), but I have had no problems with this trimmer at all.  Its cheap and it works well - I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK. I&#x27;m going to keep it. I think it&#x27;s flimsy and its snap-on pieces aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;intuitive&amp;#34; and obvious or easy to snap on, but it&#x27;s serviceable, and I should not be expecting more for $10-11 (-ish). It works. That&#x27;s the important thing. One genuine gripe, though: the included AA battery was cheap as cheap could be... Billy Jo Bob&#x27;s Batteries, Inc. - so-to-speak - and the battery was D.O.A. out of the box. I replaced it with a decent new brand-name AA battery from a pack we have on-hand, and, viola - doctor, I&#x27;m cured - it worked - so I know it was a cheap, bad battery. Other than that, if $10-11 is all you have to spend on such an item, then, this is okay - not great - but okay.</li>
            <li> Love this trimmer. Easy to use with one hand, easy to clean, trims great.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I should have sent this back but didn&#x27;t.  I kept trying to use it, but it just does NOT remove the hair.</li>
            <li> Does a great job on ear and nose hair. Priced right. Havent used the attachments yet. I&#x27;ve had good service with Wahl products in the past.</li>
