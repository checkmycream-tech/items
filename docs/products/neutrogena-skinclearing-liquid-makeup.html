            <li>/&gt;Meanwhile I would like to say I am very mjuch a Neutrogena fan.</li>
            <li>I used this whole line about a year ago</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it does anything noticeably to reduce acne, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t contribute to more of them like my old foundation.</li>
            <li>I use L&#x27;Oreal True Match Mineral makeup lightly over this as a setting powder and for extra coverage that lasts 24 hours and gives me young natural looking skin.</li>
            <li>It was my first foundation used since i am NATURALLY oily/acne prone and</li>
            <li>This makeup surprised me so much..</li>
            <li>I have been using this for many years because it is one of the few makeups that offers fragrance free, does not turn orange, and does not start out pink.</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it covered that well kinda watery, but my daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite foundation that I have ever tried!</li>
            <li> I love it. it not only covers, but helps clear skin.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly fair skin, and often have a hard time finding make-up to match. I ordered this in Alabaster and it&#x27;s PERFECT. It has a yellow undertone. I recently have been battling with hormonal acne, so I ordered this to help hide the unsightly marks on my face. It does a good job. It&#x27;s not overly heavy, so I use it in conjunction with Bobbi Brown Face Touch Up Stick and [[ASIN:B004OEBRDW bareMinerals Blemish Therapy]] which works VERY well. I wouldn&#x27;t say it does anything noticeably to reduce acne, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t contribute to more of them like my old foundation.</li>
            <li> My hypersensitivity causes me to endlessly search for the right foundation - however, this is NOT the one. The burning and stinging upon application did fade, but the color became very yellow as the day progressed. The pigment seems to separate with wear, and at the end of the day my yellowish lookimg makeup was barely-there and my skin was excessively oily.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep searching for the right foundation.</li>
            <li> I have never had to deal with breakouts before until now.  I tried a few products and then someone recommended the Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Wash.  I started using that and saw immediate improvement.  A few months later while looking at television I saw an ad for this product and since I had such good results with the Acne Was I decided that this product would be a good complement to that.  I immediately logged on to the Amazon website and placed the order after determining the shade.  I DO NOT REGRET this decision for one minute. I saw a remarkable difference and felt the smoothness return to my skin.  I know that this sounds like the typical \\&quot;can&#x27;t believe it works\\&quot; review but I feel like if this product was made especially for me.  I will not be using any other product but NEUTROGENA on my face for any reason.  This product definitely deserves an award!</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and rosacea, and since I want to cover the rosacea I have to use foundation. All other foundations make me break out EXCEPT this Neutrogena SkinClearing Liquid Makeup. In fact, it helps keep my acne in check even when I am not wearing it! I usually combine this with my expensive Lancome foundation for the perfect color and skin clearing effect. I highly recommend this if your pores clog easily and can&#x27;t wear foundation as a result.</li>
            <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite.  I am having to order 3-4 at a time (keeping in mind exp. dates) because I&#x27;m worried it will not be available.  She is SO pale and many light tone just don&#x27;t look good, this one does a good job for her.</li>
            <li> This makeup surprised me so much.. I was expecting it to not really do anything for me, just like the many other products I&#x27;ve tried. It feels creamy and comfortable and covers fairly well. I purchased because I use the SkinID system by Neutrogena, so I figured I&#x27;d stick with the brand I liked so far. I can&#x27;t use it all the time, because it dries out my sensitive skin a bit. But I love it anyhow!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for many years because it is one of the few makeups that offers fragrance free, does not turn orange, and does not start out pink. I really matches my skin tone. I use L&#x27;Oreal True Match Mineral makeup lightly over this as a setting powder and for extra coverage that lasts 24 hours and gives me young natural looking skin.</li>
            <li> Great foundation that leaves me with the feeling of wearing no makeup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only things I dont like about it....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesnt come with a pump...I always find it annoying when foundations dont come with one because then Im losing product!&lt;br /&gt;It also doesnt cover actual acne very well....I really dont have much acne AT ALL...maybe 1 blemish every once and a while. Dont expect this foundation to cover your breakouts! It may help get rid of them, but it wont really cover them. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But other than that I feel like my skin is super healthy and clear and fresh looking! :)</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> I have found it to be very good, excellent as a  matter of fact.... and use it daily.&lt;br /&gt;I will be reordering when I need more.&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile I would like to say I am very mjuch a Neutrogena fan.</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t really live up to its name and &amp;#34;skin clear&amp;#34;, but it doesn&#x27;t make anything worse either, and covers fine.</li>
            <li> The coverage is great and stays thru the day.  Will buy again if it continues to be available for use.</li>
            <li> This is the only foundation I can use that doesn&#x27;t cause my face to break out.  It also has such a light coverage but covers my small imperfections.  Most people don&#x27;t even think I&#x27;m wearing foundation.  I have tried other &amp;#34;the-grass-is-greener&amp;#34; foundations, but they ALWAYS break out.  I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t  notice improvement in my skin but it works well as a foundation</li>
            <li> It came a lot faster than I had expected (I ordered it on Saturday and it came Monday, I was expecting Tuesday if not later). I haven&#x27;t tried it out on my face, but I dabbed a bit on my hand and other than being a little darker than my skin tone (I get really pale so it&#x27;s not a surprise for me), it feels great! If it doesn&#x27;t give me any allergic reactions like other foundations I will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I used this whole line about a year ago and I saw that I started to break out. I&#x27;m still not sure if it was the makeup or my hormones. i don&#x27;t think that i&#x27;ll be using this again</li>
            <li> I made my face look like it cracked... 4 hours after I put it on. I guess it depends on other people skin types, but for me it didnt work out.</li>
            <li> I use to LOVE this product as a very early teenager. It was my first foundation used since i am NATURALLY oily/acne prone and nothing else worked just breaking me out clogging my already naturally oily skin making it even worse. This actually did help keep my skin clear with a good skin regemine i didnt at all feel fake or look fake. I actually liked putting this on as it let your natural beauty shine through and with its acne fighting ingredient felt it was helping. This also washed off easily with either soap or cleanser. The only drawbacks i would say is it was on some days drying causing flakes around chin and mouth &amp; formula is not long lasting. Expect some powder touch ups. However my good experience with this product is a thing of the past since that was 9 yrs ago.. i am now 22 and using Almay blemish healing bexause Neutrogena have seem to since change its formula AND colors. The colors now seem un natural for me either too pinkinsh or way too orange. This is definitely a great idea for people with skin like mine since its oil free and has a low salysic(spelling? Lol) but beware of the colors and for most i suggest using a moisturizer for it may be drying.</li>
            <li> Like the easy of use and coverage you get with this product.  No high perfumes and a little extra will cover up some blemishes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Neutrogena products and this is no different. It&#x27;s lightweight and won&#x27;t clog pores -- excellent for sensitive skin. I rarely need foundation, but when I do, this is my go-to.</li>
