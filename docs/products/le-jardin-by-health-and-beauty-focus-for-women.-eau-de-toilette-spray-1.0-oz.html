            <li>While the scent is OK...</li>
            <li>Item arrived before expected date and item was perfect!!!</li>
            <li>&quot; I love smelling my wrist after a long day, this perfume just makes me happy.</li>
            <li>It seems to be a well-balanced formula of both heady &amp; sexey with touches of lemony light florals.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to the smell of many perfumes, most make me nauseous and are just too strong or sweet smelling.</li>
            <li>I used to wear this years ago and when I found it, I was so excited.</li>

            <li>thanks!!</li>
            <li>It would be well worth the money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sweet, floral, not too fruity, a good blend of high and low notes.  </li>
            <li>I love the sweet heavy accent, that has a touch of vibrancy of light florals.</li>
            <li>I very much would like  to return this time.  </li>
            <li>I bought it as a Christmas present for my wife on 12-17-08 and wasn&#x27;t sure if it would arrive on time.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be the same as it was in years past, but it was a pleasant surprise to find the smell unchanged.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;ll use it much.</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>Although the bottle was small for the price, and knowing it is a beautiful scented perfume, The scent didnt not last longgg..</li>
            <li>I went from perfume to perfume, unsatisfied until I found this particular scent.  </li>
            <li>sad, when it went out of production!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Amazon, I am at last able to wear my favorite scent again.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>While it used to be easy to find, I&#x27;ve only found it online the last several years.  </li>
            <li>It smelled like the perfume was old; and the box/packaging it came in</li>
            <li>like it was old also.</li>
            <li>, you could tell it was old.</li>
            <li>now adult daughter took one sniff and exclaimed how that smelled like her</li>
            <li>But when it arrived, I found that they have changed the formula and it has changed the product completely.</li>

            <li> The scent is fresh and light.  It&#x27;s not like that scratch and sniff stuff you find between the pages of magazines and in newspaper advertising.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and she told me it wasn&#x27;t the one by max factor so Xmas was a bust. Will not buy from this seller again. She said she would try to use it but it smells powdery and it stays in the air for a long time. I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;ll use it much.</li>
            <li> I LOVED this fragrance but this bottle did not smell right...spoiled?</li>
            <li> Item arrived before expected date and item was perfect!!!</li>
            <li> not the fragrance I was thinking of....disappointed.  the price however is great!</li>
            <li> It smelled like the perfume was old; and the box/packaging it came in was yellowed like it was old also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this perfume since 1985 when I got it as a birthday gift and it still suits me. I&#x27;m very sensitive to the smell of many perfumes, most make me nauseous and are just too strong or sweet smelling. I couldn&#x27;t find this perfume for a very long time and was very sad. When I finally found it my daughter said \\&quot;I smelled like mom again.\\&quot; I love smelling my wrist after a long day, this perfume just makes me happy. What more can I say?</li>
            <li> Very hard to find in local stores, Mother in law requested it for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;Thought it was pricy for the size bottle and it being a older cologne.</li>
            <li> my mom loves this stuff, problem is...its getting REALLY hard to get ahold of now that it isn&#x27;t in production.  thanks!!</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  Reminds me of my younger days</li>
            <li> THIS STANK UP MY HOUSE, IT WAS NOT GOOD. THANK GOD PRODUCT WAS NOT FOR ME.</li>
            <li> This aroma speaks for itself. It develops a fragrance according to your oils on your skin. I discovered it over 7 years ago, and have had a hard time finding it on the shelves at local department stores. If it came in larger quantities ( 10 oz.) It would be well worth the money. I love this that well. Thank you Max Factor.</li>
            <li> This is a regular in my life. I love the sweet heavy accent, that has a touch of vibrancy of light florals. It seems to be a well-balanced formula of both heady &amp; sexey with touches of lemony light florals.</li>
            <li> I purchased a bottle of cologne (Le Jardin) that I have been unable to find anywhere else.  I received it timely and the bottle appeared to be in good shape; however, the spritzer thing doesn&#x27;t work correctly and leaks all over my fingers when I try to use it.</li>
            <li> Perfect will order again</li>
            <li> feels like a fresh new springtime day when I was 11 so innocent! beautiful smells of orange blossoms and lillies  and stays all day</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t smell well, you could tell it was old. just threw it away. waste of money. should of known better</li>
            <li> My wife had not been able to find this product for years. Local stores had quit carrying it. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be the same as it was in years past, but it was a pleasant surprise to find the smell unchanged. Thank you for that.    I bought it as a Christmas present for my wife on 12-17-08 and wasn&#x27;t sure if it would arrive on time. But, it came earlier than projected. We received it 2 or 3 days before Christmas. My wife was thrilled because I did not tell her I was getting it. Thanks again.</li>
            <li> I very much would like  to return this time.  It stinks.  It doesnt smell like I remember from years ago.</li>
            <li> I went from perfume to perfume, unsatisfied until I found this particular scent.  I was in my twenties when I found it.&lt;br /&gt;How sad, when it went out of production!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Amazon, I am at last able to wear my favorite scent again.&lt;br /&gt;My now adult daughter took one sniff and exclaimed how that smelled like her Mommy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sweet, floral, not too fruity, a good blend of high and low notes.  Music for the olfactory nerves.</li>
            <li> My sister loves this cologne.  While it used to be easy to find, I&#x27;ve only found it online the last several years.  Both bottles were in perfect shape for gift-giving.</li>
            <li> I used to wear this years ago and when I found it, I was so excited. But when it arrived, I found that they have changed the formula and it has changed the product completely. I spent $12 on something that I can&#x27;t even give away now.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift for my friend&#x27;s mom. Although the bottle was small for the price, and knowing it is a beautiful scented perfume, The scent didnt not last longgg..</li>
            <li> smells great, works well, glad to be still able to purchase this scent</li>

            <li> Love this stuff and get lots of compliments when I wear it around men :-)</li>
            <li> I prefer le jardin by max factor.</li>
            <li> While the scent is OK...I put it on me and it doesn&#x27;t smell like I remembered it. But I guess since it&#x27;s made by somebody other than Max Factor something has changed</li>
