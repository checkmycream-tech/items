            <li>What a pleasant surprise this was.</li>
            <li>Just a good price.</li>
            <li>The Expert Tools eyeshadow brush is good for:  all over eyeshadow application, blending , highlighting the brow bone, lower lid eyeshadow application and getting shadow into the corner of the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The brush has just the right amount of firmness yet it brushes the shadow on perfectly.</li>
            <li>The product is exactly what I expected&amp;for an awesome price!</li>
            <li>This brush is exactly what I needed to flawlessly apply eye shadow.</li>

            <li>works great and price is right!</li>
            <li>This came quick, and was a great deal...</li>
            <li>The bristles are nice and soft and the color payout is perfect when I use this brush.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need to apply with many strokes.  </li>
            <li>I will probably end up buying more of these brushes.</li>
            <li>Nothing more to say about it</li>
            <li>It works a lot better then the longer ones.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes.  </li>
            <li>Glad I did.</li>

            <li>Pretty good brush for the price.</li>
            <li>love how easy i can do my eyes</li>
            <li>The bristles are so soft and the brush altogether is very dense It does great job making a good eyeshadow outcome no matter what type of eyeshadow you use.</li>
            <li>Came very quickly.</li>
            <li>cheaper brushes I have used have loosened at the handle/bristle joint) and easy to use, resulting in professional-looking eyeshadow in seconds.</li>
            <li>No matter what product I&#x27;m trying to apply this brush gives a consistant payout and is easy to blend.  </li>
            <li>It also blends pretty nicely.  </li>
            <li>Spreads eyeshadow in perfect amounts so it doesn&#x27;t pick up too little where you have to work on one eye forever</li>
            <li>Shipping was also fantastic (received product days ahead of estimated arrival).</li>
            <li>Glide on smoothly</li>
            <li>This brush is made well; does not appear cheap or flimsy.  </li>
            <li>Feels soft, but applies eyeshadow much more nicely than the shadow wands.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and not too dense which makes it good for blending out shadows.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!:)</li>
            <li>is the only brush I use to apply my high light color because it is the perfect width to get just right under the eyebrow.  </li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t say enough good things about this brush.</li>
            <li>more like 3/4 the length of a normal brush.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know what to do with them because they are too impracticle for general use.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much :)</li>
            <li>For the price it is absolutely worth buying</li>
            <li>They are just the right shape and size for eyeshadow application, and the price is so right.  </li>
            <li>This is a great, firm brush!</li>
            <li>Soft and easy to blend with.</li>
            <li>Maybelline makes stellar make-up brushes.  </li>
            <li>I have bought more expensive brands, but I went back to Maybelline because they work the best.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean and dry.</li>
            <li>Super soft and the bristles have not fallen out.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to use too much product.</li>
            <li>I also love the quality because the handle is firm and most likely wont break!</li>
            <li>that is how much I like these.  </li>
            <li>This eyeshadow brush picks up and holds the makeup really well until you apply it.  </li>
            <li>It feels very &amp;#34;high quality&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>brush head is too thin...doesn&#x27;t pick up makeup very well.</li>
            <li>Just a regular brush nothing special.</li>
            <li>I needed some new eyeshadow brushes and these seemed very affordable</li>
            <li>you really need to push hard in your shadow to get enough on the brush for good coverage.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are soft but they don&#x27;t pick up as much as I want.</li>
            <li>After buying poor quality brushes in my local drugstore, this is a joy to use.</li>
            <li>The bristles are VERY soft, but it holds a lot of shadow</li>
            <li>The brush hairs are very soft.</li>
            <li>The brush is a little thicker than I like, but other than that good product.</li>
            <li>It does the job but not sure if I love the quality of the brush.</li>
            <li>So,for all that,I completely recommend!</li>
            <li>I own several of the Maybelline New York Expert Tools Eyeshadow brush and just recently purchased one for my younger sister who is just now starting to use makeup.  </li>
            <li>They last a long time if you clean them with soap and water every month or so.</li>
            <li>But I was pleasantly surprised by this one.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are too soft for my liking...</li>
            <li>No bristles have come out so far.</li>
            <li>The bristles are full, firm, yet flexible.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that it can appear to be a little cheap and the bristles do seem to fall out.  </li>
            <li>Too small to just sweep color over your lid and not fluffy enough to be an adequate crease brush.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t pick up too much either and make the color too dark.</li>

            <li> OMG!!!!!!! This brush is amazing! It doesn&#x27;t shed and picks up the make-up great so you don&#x27;t have to use too much product. Shipping was also fantastic (received product days ahead of estimated arrival).</li>
            <li> love how easy i can do my eyes</li>
            <li> Just a regular brush nothing special. I use for powder eye shadows. Just a good price. Would buy again.&lt;br /&gt; Nothing more to say about it</li>
            <li> Maybelline makes stellar make-up brushes.  I have bought more expensive brands, but I went back to Maybelline because they work the best.  They last a long time if you clean them with soap and water every month or so.</li>

            <li> I like the shorted handle on the eye shadow brush. It works a lot better then the longer ones. That they use to have</li>
            <li> Came very quickly. Great product. Spreads eyeshadow in perfect amounts so it doesn&#x27;t pick up too little where you have to work on one eye forever but it doesn&#x27;t pick up too much either and make the color too dark. The brush hairs are very soft.</li>
            <li> The product is exactly what I expected&amp;for an awesome price! Also,it arrived in record time. So,for all that,I completely recommend! Thanks!:)</li>
            <li> Great at blending eye shadow! Great quality and worth purchasing! I also love the quality because the handle is firm and most likely wont break!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.  They are just the right shape and size for eyeshadow application, and the price is so right.  I had one of these brushes, lost it, and bought three so that wouldn&#x27;t happen again - that is how much I like these.  They are very good quality (I don&#x27;t see any bristle shed and cheaper brushes I have used have loosened at the handle/bristle joint) and easy to use, resulting in professional-looking eyeshadow in seconds.</li>
            <li> Great product. Glide on smoothly</li>
            <li> Not much to say-- it&#x27;s a nice brush and it&#x27;s held up to daily use.  Feels soft, but applies eyeshadow much more nicely than the shadow wands.</li>
            <li> The brush handle is way smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Thanks so much :)</li>
            <li> Wider than I expec but hi quality.</li>

            <li> The bristles are too soft for my liking...you really need to push hard in your shadow to get enough on the brush for good coverage.  I prefer ecotools..which I have now purchased again.</li>
            <li> This eyeshadow brush picks up and holds the makeup really well until you apply it.  I hope to use this brush for a long time.  For the price, it is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> This is a great, firm brush! It feels very &amp;#34;high quality&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> the quality is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have about three of these brushes and not matter what other ones I buy I always come back to this one from Maybelline.  The bristles are nice and soft and the color payout is perfect when I use this brush.  No matter what product I&#x27;m trying to apply this brush gives a consistant payout and is easy to blend.  The only downside is that it can appear to be a little cheap and the bristles do seem to fall out.  For the price it is absolutely worth buying and it will become one of your go to tools</li>
            <li> After buying poor quality brushes in my local drugstore, this is a joy to use. The bristles are full, firm, yet flexible. Perfect for eye shadow.</li>
            <li> Pretty good brush for the price. Fast delivery. Thank u</li>
            <li> I have always brought expensive brushes but on a whim I purchased this - I love it. The brush has just the right amount of firmness yet it brushes the shadow on perfectly. What a pleasant surprise this was.</li>
            <li> This brush is exactly what I needed to flawlessly apply eye shadow. Great price, too! Easy to clean and dry.</li>
            <li> Hallelujah!! I own several of the Maybelline New York Expert Tools Eyeshadow brush and just recently purchased one for my younger sister who is just now starting to use makeup.  For a drug store brand I find this brush to be comparable if not easier to use than the MAC 213 Fluff Brush.  The Expert Tools eyeshadow brush is good for:  all over eyeshadow application, blending , highlighting the brow bone, lower lid eyeshadow application and getting shadow into the corner of the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;This is the only brush I use to apply my high light color because it is the perfect width to get just right under the eyebrow.  The bristles are soft and not too dense which makes it good for blending out shadows.  I just can&#x27;t say enough good things about this brush. You will get a lot of bang for your buck when you buy this one.</li>
            <li> Does its job and is a great price. Soft and easy to blend with. No bristles have come out so far.</li>
            <li> brush head is too thin...doesn&#x27;t pick up makeup very well.</li>
            <li> This eyeshadow brush is almost perfect. The bristles are so soft and the brush altogether is very dense It does great job making a good eyeshadow outcome no matter what type of eyeshadow you use.</li>
            <li> by any means but this brush does the job.  I watched a demo video on Maybelline&#x27;s website and decided to try it.  Glad I did.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the BEST eyeshadow brush.  Have already purchased 4, and gave one to my daughter.</li>
            <li> Great brush!  I use it every day!</li>
            <li> Love this brush!! Super soft and the bristles have not fallen out. Applies powder very nicely.</li>
            <li> I needed some new eyeshadow brushes and these seemed very affordable so I bought two. Now I&#x27;m sort of regretting this decision because these aren&#x27;t what I wanted. They are not full-sized brushes - more like 3/4 the length of a normal brush. The bristles are soft but they don&#x27;t pick up as much as I want. I honestly don&#x27;t know what to do with them because they are too impracticle for general use. Too small to just sweep color over your lid and not fluffy enough to be an adequate crease brush. Save your money for something better.</li>
