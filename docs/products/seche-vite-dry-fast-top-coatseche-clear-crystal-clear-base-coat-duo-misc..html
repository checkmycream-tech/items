            <li>The price is just remarkable</li>
            <li>Awesome top coat.</li>
            <li>This top coat is the best there is.</li>
            <li>The top coat is the best in the world!</li>
            <li>So glad I did because it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>The top coat is awesome!</li>
            <li>Top coat is awesome though.</li>
            <li>This top coat is perfect for me and withstands all the things I do.</li>
            <li>The top coat is the best top coat i have ever used!</li>
            <li>If you have bright colors, start by putting vaseline all around your nail to avoid the color bleeding all over your skin.  </li>
            <li>This is the best top coat you can own.</li>
            <li>my girlfriend loved, she said she would use again.</li>
            <li>Good for an at home or at the salon mani pedi.</li>
            <li>I have always used Seche Vite (15 years in business and always have loved it).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard good things about this product</li>
            <li>Seche isn&#x27;t a good product.  </li>
            <li>For the price, this base/top coat combo is a good deal.</li>
            <li>So, nail polish lacquer seemed like a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product seemed like a good deal for both, so I ordered it.  </li>
            <li>The rumors are true, the best coats to use for polish lovers.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>i love this stuff...makes my mani look great...</li>
            <li>and generally I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Please keep making that top coat forever!</li>
            <li>I am extremely satisfied and will recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>So as much as i love this, it lost one star on the smell and the chipping!</li>
            <li>This top coat is amazing!</li>
            <li>but I see from you tube that a lot of ladies use this and love it!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Today is Thursday, and as I just went to fix the one index finger, I noticed that 3 more nails with the product lifting off!  </li>

            <li>fast shipping and wrapped perfectly</li>
            <li>I use this with glitter polishes and it creates a nice protective film over the glitter and nail art.  </li>
            <li>If you do your own nails or would like to start, you need both of these products.  </li>
            <li>I never did my own nails.  </li>
            <li>it gives your nails a nice shine.</li>
            <li>every woman should own these products</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve been told it really does work best when you use them together.</li>
            <li>Fast drying with an excellent shine!!</li>
            <li>THEY ARE NICE AND HOLD ON TO YOUR NAIL POLISH.</li>

            <li>It has a nice shine on its own and polish goes on nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>One bottle can easily cost $8, so getting two for $9.50 is a steal!</li>
            <li>I have a new addiction with these nice polishes!!</li>
            <li>The more you do your own nails, the better you get</li>

            <li>and I was able to go about my day within 30 with no worry.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to follow directions to liberally use the top coat</li>
            <li>Then polish and top coat.  </li>

            <li>I Love the top coat --it</li>

            <li>and I love both of them.</li>

            <li>I found out about this top coat because my nail tech uses the product.</li>

            <li>Love this top coat.</li>
            <li>The top coat might do its job too well though.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the shine it leaves on my nail</li>
            <li>It seemed to be a great duo at first since my nails were shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>Polish dries quickly with top coat!</li>
            <li>And the top coats smell was extremely potent and had the habit of drying out to a goop very quickly.</li>
            <li>As most reviewers had commented, the top coat is fabulous.</li>
            <li>Great seller and customer service, super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>The top coat stays glossy and chip free for days.</li>
            <li>I have a very hands on job and to be able to have a top coat that can withstand all the damage my hands take is amazing.</li>
            <li>and I can already see that I&#x27;m not going to be able to use the full bottle before having to order more.</li>
            <li>I am almost done using my first two bottles, so I&#x27;ll be ordering more!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find it for a better price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>So quick and easy!</li>
            <li>The best, you won&#x27;t buy any other brand after using this.</li>

            <li>/&gt;-glides on easily and smoothly&lt;</li>
            <li>Strong smell but</li>
            <li>The top coat dries really fast and leaves a nice finish.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing and drys so fast!</li>
            <li>it was fine.</li>
            <li>I easily get a week out of OPI manicures, and 4-5 days on cheap drugstore-brand manicures.</li>
            <li>The top coat dries your nail polish really quickly</li>
            <li>The top coat dries out IN THE BOTTLE fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>This is in fact my first ever Amazon review after all these years shopping online, but I just absolutely felt the need to write this review as the product is so wonderful, and I truly hope you will enjoy it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>It makes a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>I have used all types of polish with this duo, cheap drugstore polish to Essie and OPI, and it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li>it is so fabulous I also bought the nail paint thinner</li>
            <li>then the Seche UV topcoat with my Royal Natils UV light.  </li>
            <li>, I decided to stop getting manis at the salon because I have the time and actually enjoy doing it myself</li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly and you can tell it helps the nail polish hold.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already bought a bottle of the top coat prior to this purchase and loved it.</li>
            <li>Super shiney, easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very sturdy and doesn&#x27;t smell very strong.</li>
            <li>I am going to try it more and see if it was just a one off situation, but otherwise I had higher expectations.</li>
            <li>Keeps your nails looking fresh for weeks!</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t too familiar with this brand</li>
            <li>First, I checked if this product was available in Seoul, South Korea and it was but for about 30-50 USD; but on Amazon a lot of sellers were pricing it at about 5 dollars a bottle!</li>
            <li>Polish goes on smooth and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>This is by and far my favorite top coat.</li>
            <li>I have only used the two together, so I can&#x27;t say whether the top coat works well on its own</li>
            <li>is by far the best and dries even faster than others that claim the same outcome.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Top coat dries super fast so I can put it on even if I am running out the door!</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews and was super excited to try this.  </li>
            <li>Everyone seems to love these, but I don&#x27;t really see anything special about them.</li>
            <li>The colors have stayed true, no chipping</li>
            <li>Perfect for a nail fanatic like me.</li>
            <li>Made my nails really shiny :)</li>
            <li>It completely dries within a minute (and is nice and shiny) and lasts for days without chipping.</li>
            <li>Very nice and quick to dry</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a good product, easy to apply, fast drying, and provides a good long-lasting hard coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean, easy, and super fast!</li>
            <li>, none really, I guess though you should be aware that the top coat has a really strong chemical smell when you apply it (but it goes away).</li>
            <li>right after!&lt;br /&gt;-Shiny, glossy, chip free nails</li>
            <li>I can now do my own nails now and they dry quickly and looking smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li>I have tried man quick dries</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>, it is thinner than you would expect but dries incredibly quick.  </li>
            <li>The very best nail polish out there and great base coat too.</li>
            <li>Drys quickly and makes nails shine.  </li>
            <li>super</li>
            <li>Received these really quick.  </li>
            <li>It dries very fast and smooth.</li>
            <li>It dry fast and had a beautiful shine almost like uv gel.</li>
            <li>Had this quick dry product applied by my manicurist and loved it.</li>
            <li>had originally bought a dollar-store bottle of top-coat, and that stuff stayed sticky, and wore off pretty quick.</li>
            <li>Very professional products!The top coat is a bit smelly</li>
            <li>It is really Seche Vite!!</li>
            <li>Not too impressed so far I&#x27;ve had to re polish my nails twice in less than a week .</li>
            <li>I never paint my own nails because typically after I finish the top coat I can&#x27;t do anything for 2 hours</li>
            <li>I use this on my 2 year old who loves to wear polish., hoping to protect her nails and still make the polish stay on for more than a couple days.</li>
            <li>My polish doesn&#x27;t seem any shiner or more lasting than with the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li>It was worth what I paid for it.  </li>
            <li>The top coat is fast drying and leaves a really shiny finish.</li>
            <li>But chose these because of their good reviews and it is truly the best base coat i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li>then searched for more professional nail lacquers.</li>
            <li>So many great reviews in fact that I thought I seriously had to try it for myself!</li>
            <li>Not to mention it arrived quickly and the seller responds fast too!</li>
            <li>or you&#x27;ll take the polish right off.  </li>
            <li>The top coat dried so quickly, I was able to do anything after 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>It also makes really cheap polishes look high end</li>
            <li>I love this base coat and top coat, really makes my mani&#x27;s beautiful!</li>
            <li>I used it with Sally Hansen Xtreme Wear which usually has great durability without a topcoat and it peeled right off after day one.</li>
            <li>The best base and top coat ever!  </li>
            <li>Best base and top coat around!</li>
            <li>My favorite base/ top coat to date, but it can get a little pricey.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE the Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat because it really does dry you nails sooooo much faster than any other top coat I have ever used!</li>
            <li>dries super fast.</li>
            <li>The seller was super fast shipping it.</li>
            <li>I still use it because the finish is fine, but there will be stings of polish actually trailing from the bottle to my nails that I have to clean off the table!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dries very fast..</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping,it dries very fast, thx</li>
            <li>The base coat is okay, but the top coat is by far the best out there.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how quickly I received it !</li>
            <li>Both dry so quickly which I love.</li>
            <li>Top coat make it quick dry.</li>
            <li>It probably does make your nails pretty and shiny, but so do a bunch of others with no Toluene.</li>
            <li>but I find my polish does not last more than 3 days when I use this.</li>
            <li>I first saw these at a Sally&#x27;s Beauty and picked them up.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I will not go back to using regular top coat, this stuff works like magic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for several years and will never use another top coat.  </li>
            <li>The Seche Vite would chip my manicure the first day.</li>
            <li>It makes painting my nails so much easier and five times faster drying time!</li>
            <li>Within a couple of minutes after I did the last nail, I was able to begin applying my polish.  </li>
            <li>The top coat dries INSTANTLY!</li>
            <li>well I checked walmart last night and it was more like $8.98.  </li>
            <li>The top coat shines, protects well and ling lasting.</li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t want top shine and quick dry!</li>
            <li>I thought that if I used Seche Clear along with Seche Vite, my at-home manicure would be fantastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll like reorder just he top coat next time.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I would definitely give the nail polish some time to dry on its own before applying the top coat because it started to take off some of the polish when I tried to go straight into it.</li>
            <li>I first used it with super cheap red color on my toenails and the color looks like gel and has lasted 2 weeks without chipping!</li>
            <li>overall I love the product one of the best base coat and top coat</li>
            <li>In my opinion, the Seche Vite top coat and base coat are the best EVER!</li>
            <li>The top is really fast not like others which say they are but actually not.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, these are the best base coat and top coat</li>
            <li>The top coat really does enable you to get on with your life shortly after you apply it.  </li>
            <li>This is the best base and top coat out there.</li>
            <li>Hands-down, best base and top coat</li>
            <li>Awesome base and top coat.</li>
            <li>Best base coat and top coat ever.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and dry quickly.  </li>
            <li>The best base coat and top coat</li>
            <li>The top and base coat are wonderful!</li>
            <li>It dries REALLY fast no matter how many coats you put on, and it last for days.</li>
            <li>This is the best base coat and top coat I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>I read an online article recently about top 10 beauty products every girl should have and this Seche Vite fast dry top coat was listed as one of them.</li>
            <li>: Pretty shiny, dries polish fast, protects nails</li>
            <li>I love the shine and how long any nail color stays on the nails.</li>
            <li>Quick drying and clear.</li>
            <li>The only problem i have is that it has an insanely strong smell when applying and remains with a smell on my nails.</li>
            <li>Nails stay strong and color last for days.  </li>
            <li>: It doesn&#x27;t work as well with certain color coats.</li>
            <li>i really prefer to do my own nails, however nothing bugs me quite like spending a half an hour or more shaping, filing, and painting my nails and then smudging them after I think they are dry...</li>
            <li>Dries my nails instantly and it is SUPER DUPER shiny!</li>
            <li>I bought this because the reviews looked pretty decent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty decent.</li>
            <li>very high shine gloss though.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for seche, since they get such great reviews, but my polish alone with no topcoat lasts longer than with the seche vite, it does dry fast, but the tips wear quickly and the polish starts peeling after only a day.</li>
            <li>This stuff dries nails fast.</li>
            <li>Give my nails a very shining look.</li>
            <li>fast looks shiny.</li>
            <li>I am a nail polish fanatic and own many various colors.  </li>
            <li>The seller was very prompt in a response and refunded my money.</li>
            <li>Also, you NEED to put the top coat on while polish is still wet.</li>
            <li>Very glossy finish.</li>
            <li>drys fast.  </li>
            <li>but this is just way too much maintenence.  </li>
            <li>Two timesavers that will be greatly appreciated, and they got to me on time as well.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t pay that much money for it</li>
            <li>It drys amazingly fast.</li>
            <li>For me it keeps my nail polish on until I am ready to take it off.</li>
            <li>DOESN&#x27;T CHIP AS FAST.</li>
            <li>i really recommend it.</li>
            <li>drys fast</li>
            <li>n don,t chip fast.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and all</li>
            <li>/&gt;-base coat adheres to the nail polish color of your choice INSTANTLY and smoothly without any streaks or bubbles&lt;</li>
            <li>Shipping was lightening fast and product was packaged well.&lt;br /&gt;Seller was very responsive.</li>
            <li>Indeed fast drying toppcoat.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, Seche Vite top coat and base coat has made an incredible impression on me.</li>
            <li>Two very handy products that I found here that save me expensive trips to the nail salon - because they&#x27;re exactly what THEY use!  </li>
            <li>Actually dries fast and still shines!!!</li>
            <li>It is just like any other bottom and top coat.</li>
            <li>Just doesn&#x27;t work any better than any other brand I ever purchased.</li>
            <li>I do not use any other top coat but this.</li>
            <li>This is a huge pro for me because if I paint my nails a dark or bright color (ie: red, hot pink, etc)</li>
            <li>It honestly won&#x27;t be a perfect dry after only a few minutes</li>
            <li>, I WAS SHOCKED BUT HAPPY, THIS IS WITH WASHING DISHES AND EVEYTHING, GREAT PRODUCT, DEFINETLY BUYING THE BIGGER SIZE NEXT TIME</li>
            <li>\\&quot;nice\\&quot; ones, just the dollar nail polish in a pretty shade, but after using Seche Clear &amp; Seche Vite</li>
            <li>However, my Sally Hansen top coat seems to prolong my nailpolish more than this duo of base and top coat.  </li>
            <li>But, since I&#x27;m only using it on metals, I&#x27;ll probably use up the whole bottle of top coat the next time I use it, and hopefully avoid the need to use thinner.</li>
            <li>I love the Seche Vite top coat, so I decided to order both the base and top coat.  </li>
            <li>Two days with the bright and colorful Iconic paired with this base and top coat and only one tiny chip.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve made a new customer in me!</li>
            <li>top coats, they weren&#x27;t bad, but I picked up this duo at a good price and tried it out.</li>
            <li>I literally find myself racing to put on a smooth coat before it starts to dry.</li>
            <li>I can literally cover any of my nail polishes with this top coat and it covers all of the weird bumps or dings and smooths it out like magic.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s even better because the base coat is included and the price is great.</li>
            <li>Great top and base coats.  </li>
            <li>MAINLY WHY I BUY THEM.</li>
            <li>Great base and top coat.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this pair to anyone who enjoys doing their nails themselves.</li>
            <li>I used the Kleancolor line of metallics (another line I would highly recommend)</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The topcoat doesn&#x27;t dry as fast as the initial use, but is better than the norm.</li>
            <li>I am in love the dry fast top coat, it gives such a shiny effect and dries faast, although the small is really strong!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff stinks like terpentine and is not that effective, though the top coat does dry quickly</li>
            <li>I usually get it for 3 dollars both bottles :) and it drys supper fast</li>
            <li>this gives you a full week long manicure.</li>
            <li>The big plus here is, the top coat dries super fast and rock hard, no smudges.</li>
            <li>the color comes off in a clean single sweep (regardless of color) with no smearing or tinting.</li>
            <li>Let me first say, this really does dry nails FAST.</li>
            <li>I really liked the option of buying both together for a slightly lower price than individually.</li>
            <li>However, the next day, my nails started chipping right away.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s only been a day, but my nails look so fresh and professionally done!</li>
            <li>base coat is fine, top coat peels off easily by day 4.</li>
            <li>It is very thick and you have to work kind of fast when applying it.  </li>
            <li>The base coat protects nails from polish pigments that can stain them, and the top coat ensures that your polish will dry quickly with a beautifully glossy shine in a short period of time.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the product gives a great, smooth shine to my nails and the base works well to prevent staining.</li>
            <li>Seche the quick dry</li>
            <li>so I would definitely keep the top coat tightly closed whenever you do not need it.</li>
            <li>This is a really good base and top coat.  </li>
            <li>Good price for both  base &amp; top coat.  </li>
            <li>Using this duo makes my nail polish last so much longer before chipping!</li>
            <li>I love Seche, especially the top coat which dries the polish in mere minutes.</li>
            <li>I received it today ,and only used top coat on my original polished nails--and it dried in seconds, literally, maybe 20 second--and it was totally dry</li>
            <li>Put that on an old nail color and the shininess beats my newly bought OPI.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why the top coat was thick or the brush was bent since it seemed new, but perhaps it wasn&#x27;t as new as I believed.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Usually I like the top coat too, but the bottle I received seemed a bit thick and the brush was slightly bent, The bent brush didn&#x27;t affect putting it on, but the thickness of the top coat meant it didn&#x27;t dry as fast as it normally did</li>
            <li>I wanted to try Seche Vite for a long time and I finally decided to purchase some after seeing how cheap it was on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I could even blow dry my hair and run my freshly painted nails through my hair</li>
            <li>This base coat allows the nail polish to go on and stay on for several days without chipping and the top coat dried quickly and made the nails looks great.</li>
            <li>this product is amazing defiantly get the base and top coat</li>
            <li>Made my nails look professionally done.</li>
            <li>Dries fast and helps color last.</li>
            <li>and my nails always look professionally done.  </li>
            <li>I have no idea what happened as it is not that old.  </li>
            <li>Dries completely within about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Old stock perhaps?</li>
            <li>My nail polish often peeled off completely intact.</li>
            <li>so I had to buy it for old times sake.</li>
            <li>The only negative thing I have to say is that the top coat has a very chemically smell when applying it, but the smell goes away once the polish dries.</li>
            <li>wow..</li>
            <li>The top coat is so thick and gummy and stringy</li>
            <li>The base coat is perfect.</li>
            <li>I mean your nails will last until YOU&#x27;RE ready to change them, and who doesn&#x27;t love that?</li>
            <li>(I mean this top coat)</li>
            <li>Love this stuff the base coat and top coat work well to help keep the polish on longer and the dry time is quick.</li>
            <li>The base coat is also very good to keep the main nail color from chipping over time.</li>
            <li>The only reason why it did not get 5 stars is because the top coat seems a little thicker than it should be!</li>
            <li>Never mess up a nail again. ...</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t bubble, dries super fast, and you can go about your day almost immediately because it dries hard.</li>
            <li>But the top coat creates ridiculous shine and your nails do dry extremely fast.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Seche is apparently what professional manicurists use and it was reportedly the strongest lacquer I could find.</li>
            <li>I now realized the base and top coat are really important and the quality of the nail polish color doesn&#x27;t matter as much.</li>
            <li>but it definitely cuts down the dry time from two hours to maybe a little less than an hour which is still pretty great.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for the polish to dry fast</li>
            <li>This duo makes my nail polish dry much faster, and my nail polish lasts longer.</li>
            <li>If it remains this price or at least cheaper than in the store I will most definitely purchase again.  </li>
            <li>If you need a fast drying top coat--this is the one, you will not got wrong.</li>
            <li>Also, my friend had the top coat and left it open for a little too long and it got really goopy and gross</li>
            <li>overall I&#x27;m happy with it especially since it&#x27;s probably difficult to find in stores that I regularly go to...</li>
            <li>Worst of all, the top coat got incredibly gloopy after just having it a few weeks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-top coat is thick and also goes on smoothly and evenly</li>
            <li>I was hoping for the high gloss finish to last a couple of days, but, it does get dull just like any other top coat.  </li>
            <li>This is the only fast dry topcoat I will ever use.  </li>
            <li>: Doesn&#x27;t last very long, shine wears off, the top coat is very thick and it tends to make my polish &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; off instead of chip like normal.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised at how fast it dried</li>
            <li>Finally, I have learned that the key to chip/peeling prevention is to start with a very dry nail (can be accomplished with a quick rub with witch hazel) and put the base coat both on top and bottom of your nail.  </li>
            <li>The base and top coat are great, however, once it gets a little old it gets thick.</li>
            <li>I add a little bit and its brand new again!!</li>
            <li>It has a super shiny, fast dry finish and can be layered for nail art or left in on thin coat for a very sheer, shiny finish on any polish.</li>
            <li>Hands down my favorite brand of base and top coat.</li>
            <li>The base holds polish well and the top coat dries incredibly quickly.</li>
            <li>The only issue I have with these bottles is that my bottle of top coat is only half gone, but I&#x27;m already finding it hard to get the brush to reach the product to get enough on the brush.</li>
            <li>super shinny and thick enough to cover all the glitter or designs to make a flat cover.</li>

            <li> i will never buy another top coat again !!  </li>
            <li> ---Amazing!</li>
            <li> The price is just remarkable</li>
            <li> Awesome top coat.</li>
            <li> This top coat is the best there is.</li>
            <li> The top coat is the best in the world!</li>
            <li> So glad I did because it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> The top coat is awesome!</li>
            <li> Top coat is awesome though.</li>
            <li> This top coat is perfect for me and withstands all the things I do.</li>
            <li> The top coat is the best top coat i have ever used!</li>
            <li> If you have bright colors, start by putting vaseline all around your nail to avoid the color bleeding all over your skin.  </li>
            <li> This is the best top coat you can own.</li>
            <li> my girlfriend loved, she said she would use again.</li>
            <li> Good for an at home or at the salon mani pedi.</li>
            <li> I have always used Seche Vite (15 years in business and always have loved it).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard good things about this product</li>
            <li> Seche isn&#x27;t a good product.  </li>
            <li> For the price, this base/top coat combo is a good deal.</li>
            <li> So, nail polish lacquer seemed like a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product seemed like a good deal for both, so I ordered it.  </li>

            <li> and I love both of them.</li>

            <li> I absolutely love the shine it leaves on my nail</li>
            <li> It seemed to be a great duo at first since my nails were shiny and smooth.</li>

            <li> Great seller and customer service, super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> The top coat stays glossy and chip free for days.</li>
            <li> I have a very hands on job and to be able to have a top coat that can withstand all the damage my hands take is amazing.</li>
            <li> and I can already see that I&#x27;m not going to be able to use the full bottle before having to order more.</li>
            <li> I am almost done using my first two bottles, so I&#x27;ll be ordering more!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find it for a better price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> So quick and easy!</li>
            <li> The best, you won&#x27;t buy any other brand after using this.</li>
            <li> Makes polishing nails so easy and not to worry about them smudging.</li>
            <li> It dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-glides on easily and smoothly&lt;</li>

            <li> The top coat dries really fast and leaves a nice finish.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and drys so fast!</li>
            <li> it was fine.</li>
            <li> I easily get a week out of OPI manicures, and 4-5 days on cheap drugstore-brand manicures.</li>
            <li> The top coat dries your nail polish really quickly</li>
            <li> The top coat dries out IN THE BOTTLE fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> This is in fact my first ever Amazon review after all these years shopping online, but I just absolutely felt the need to write this review as the product is so wonderful, and I truly hope you will enjoy it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> It makes a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> I have used all types of polish with this duo, cheap drugstore polish to Essie and OPI, and it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> it is so fabulous I also bought the nail paint thinner</li>
            <li> then the Seche UV topcoat with my Royal Natils UV light.  </li>
            <li> , I decided to stop getting manis at the salon because I have the time and actually enjoy doing it myself</li>
            <li> It glides on smoothly and you can tell it helps the nail polish hold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already bought a bottle of the top coat prior to this purchase and loved it.</li>
            <li> Super shiney, easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very sturdy and doesn&#x27;t smell very strong.</li>
            <li> I am going to try it more and see if it was just a one off situation, but otherwise I had higher expectations.</li>
            <li> Keeps your nails looking fresh for weeks!</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t too familiar with this brand</li>
            <li> First, I checked if this product was available in Seoul, South Korea and it was but for about 30-50 USD; but on Amazon a lot of sellers were pricing it at about 5 dollars a bottle!</li>
            <li> Polish goes on smooth and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> This is by and far my favorite top coat.</li>
            <li> I have only used the two together, so I can&#x27;t say whether the top coat works well on its own</li>
            <li> is by far the best and dries even faster than others that claim the same outcome.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Top coat dries super fast so I can put it on even if I am running out the door!</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and was super excited to try this.  </li>
            <li> Everyone seems to love these, but I don&#x27;t really see anything special about them.</li>
            <li> The colors have stayed true, no chipping</li>
            <li> Perfect for a nail fanatic like me.</li>
            <li> Made my nails really shiny :)</li>
            <li> It completely dries within a minute (and is nice and shiny) and lasts for days without chipping.</li>
            <li> Very nice and quick to dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a good product, easy to apply, fast drying, and provides a good long-lasting hard coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clean, easy, and super fast!</li>
            <li> , none really, I guess though you should be aware that the top coat has a really strong chemical smell when you apply it (but it goes away).</li>
            <li> right after!&lt;br /&gt;-Shiny, glossy, chip free nails</li>
            <li> I can now do my own nails now and they dry quickly and looking smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li> I have tried man quick dries</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> , it is thinner than you would expect but dries incredibly quick.  </li>
            <li> The very best nail polish out there and great base coat too.</li>
            <li> Drys quickly and makes nails shine.  </li>
            <li> super</li>
            <li> Received these really quick.  </li>
            <li> It dries very fast and smooth.</li>
            <li> It dry fast and had a beautiful shine almost like uv gel.</li>
            <li> Had this quick dry product applied by my manicurist and loved it.</li>
            <li> had originally bought a dollar-store bottle of top-coat, and that stuff stayed sticky, and wore off pretty quick.</li>
            <li> Very professional products!The top coat is a bit smelly</li>
            <li> It is really Seche Vite!!</li>
            <li> Not too impressed so far I&#x27;ve had to re polish my nails twice in less than a week .</li>
            <li> I never paint my own nails because typically after I finish the top coat I can&#x27;t do anything for 2 hours</li>
            <li> I use this on my 2 year old who loves to wear polish., hoping to protect her nails and still make the polish stay on for more than a couple days.</li>
            <li> My polish doesn&#x27;t seem any shiner or more lasting than with the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> It was worth what I paid for it.  </li>
            <li> The top coat is fast drying and leaves a really shiny finish.</li>
            <li> But chose these because of their good reviews and it is truly the best base coat i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li> then searched for more professional nail lacquers.</li>
            <li> So many great reviews in fact that I thought I seriously had to try it for myself!</li>
            <li> Not to mention it arrived quickly and the seller responds fast too!</li>
            <li> or you&#x27;ll take the polish right off.  </li>
            <li> The top coat dried so quickly, I was able to do anything after 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li> It also makes really cheap polishes look high end</li>
            <li> I love this base coat and top coat, really makes my mani&#x27;s beautiful!</li>
            <li> I used it with Sally Hansen Xtreme Wear which usually has great durability without a topcoat and it peeled right off after day one.</li>
            <li> The best base and top coat ever!  </li>
            <li> Best base and top coat around!</li>
            <li> My favorite base/ top coat to date, but it can get a little pricey.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE the Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat because it really does dry you nails sooooo much faster than any other top coat I have ever used!</li>
            <li> dries super fast.</li>
            <li> The seller was super fast shipping it.</li>
            <li> I still use it because the finish is fine, but there will be stings of polish actually trailing from the bottle to my nails that I have to clean off the table!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dries very fast..</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping,it dries very fast, thx</li>
            <li> The base coat is okay, but the top coat is by far the best out there.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how quickly I received it !</li>
            <li> Both dry so quickly which I love.</li>
            <li> Top coat make it quick dry.</li>
            <li> It probably does make your nails pretty and shiny, but so do a bunch of others with no Toluene.</li>
            <li> but I find my polish does not last more than 3 days when I use this.</li>
            <li> I first saw these at a Sally&#x27;s Beauty and picked them up.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> I will not go back to using regular top coat, this stuff works like magic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several years and will never use another top coat.  </li>
            <li> The Seche Vite would chip my manicure the first day.</li>
            <li> It makes painting my nails so much easier and five times faster drying time!</li>
            <li> Within a couple of minutes after I did the last nail, I was able to begin applying my polish.  </li>
            <li> The top coat dries INSTANTLY!</li>
            <li> well I checked walmart last night and it was more like $8.98.  </li>
            <li> The top coat shines, protects well and ling lasting.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t want top shine and quick dry!</li>
            <li> I thought that if I used Seche Clear along with Seche Vite, my at-home manicure would be fantastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll like reorder just he top coat next time.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I would definitely give the nail polish some time to dry on its own before applying the top coat because it started to take off some of the polish when I tried to go straight into it.</li>
            <li> I first used it with super cheap red color on my toenails and the color looks like gel and has lasted 2 weeks without chipping!</li>
            <li> overall I love the product one of the best base coat and top coat</li>
            <li> In my opinion, the Seche Vite top coat and base coat are the best EVER!</li>
            <li> The top is really fast not like others which say they are but actually not.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, these are the best base coat and top coat</li>
            <li> The top coat really does enable you to get on with your life shortly after you apply it.  </li>
            <li> This is the best base and top coat out there.</li>
            <li> Hands-down, best base and top coat</li>
            <li> Awesome base and top coat.</li>
            <li> Best base coat and top coat ever.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and dry quickly.  </li>
            <li> The best base coat and top coat</li>
            <li> The top and base coat are wonderful!</li>
            <li> It dries REALLY fast no matter how many coats you put on, and it last for days.</li>
            <li> This is the best base coat and top coat I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I read an online article recently about top 10 beauty products every girl should have and this Seche Vite fast dry top coat was listed as one of them.</li>
            <li> : Pretty shiny, dries polish fast, protects nails</li>
            <li> I love the shine and how long any nail color stays on the nails.</li>
            <li> Quick drying and clear.</li>
            <li> The only problem i have is that it has an insanely strong smell when applying and remains with a smell on my nails.</li>
            <li> Nails stay strong and color last for days.  </li>
            <li> : It doesn&#x27;t work as well with certain color coats.</li>
            <li> i really prefer to do my own nails, however nothing bugs me quite like spending a half an hour or more shaping, filing, and painting my nails and then smudging them after I think they are dry...</li>
            <li> Dries my nails instantly and it is SUPER DUPER shiny!</li>
            <li> I bought this because the reviews looked pretty decent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty decent.</li>
            <li> very high shine gloss though.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for seche, since they get such great reviews, but my polish alone with no topcoat lasts longer than with the seche vite, it does dry fast, but the tips wear quickly and the polish starts peeling after only a day.</li>
            <li> This stuff dries nails fast.</li>
            <li> Give my nails a very shining look.</li>
            <li> fast looks shiny.</li>
            <li> I am a nail polish fanatic and own many various colors.  </li>
            <li> The seller was very prompt in a response and refunded my money.</li>
            <li> Also, you NEED to put the top coat on while polish is still wet.</li>
            <li> Very glossy finish.</li>
            <li> drys fast.  </li>
            <li> but this is just way too much maintenence.  </li>
            <li> Two timesavers that will be greatly appreciated, and they got to me on time as well.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t pay that much money for it</li>
            <li> It drys amazingly fast.</li>
            <li> For me it keeps my nail polish on until I am ready to take it off.</li>
            <li> DOESN&#x27;T CHIP AS FAST.</li>
            <li> i really recommend it.</li>
            <li> drys fast</li>
            <li> n don,t chip fast.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and all</li>
            <li> /&gt;-base coat adheres to the nail polish color of your choice INSTANTLY and smoothly without any streaks or bubbles&lt;</li>
            <li> Shipping was lightening fast and product was packaged well.&lt;br /&gt;Seller was very responsive.</li>
            <li> Indeed fast drying toppcoat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, Seche Vite top coat and base coat has made an incredible impression on me.</li>
            <li> Two very handy products that I found here that save me expensive trips to the nail salon - because they&#x27;re exactly what THEY use!  </li>
            <li> Actually dries fast and still shines!!!</li>
            <li> It is just like any other bottom and top coat.</li>
            <li> Just doesn&#x27;t work any better than any other brand I ever purchased.</li>
            <li> I do not use any other top coat but this.</li>
            <li> This is a huge pro for me because if I paint my nails a dark or bright color (ie: red, hot pink, etc)</li>
            <li> It honestly won&#x27;t be a perfect dry after only a few minutes</li>
            <li> , I WAS SHOCKED BUT HAPPY, THIS IS WITH WASHING DISHES AND EVEYTHING, GREAT PRODUCT, DEFINETLY BUYING THE BIGGER SIZE NEXT TIME</li>
            <li> \\&quot;nice\\&quot; ones, just the dollar nail polish in a pretty shade, but after using Seche Clear &amp; Seche Vite</li>
            <li> However, my Sally Hansen top coat seems to prolong my nailpolish more than this duo of base and top coat.  </li>
            <li> But, since I&#x27;m only using it on metals, I&#x27;ll probably use up the whole bottle of top coat the next time I use it, and hopefully avoid the need to use thinner.</li>
            <li> I love the Seche Vite top coat, so I decided to order both the base and top coat.  </li>
            <li> Two days with the bright and colorful Iconic paired with this base and top coat and only one tiny chip.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve made a new customer in me!</li>
            <li> top coats, they weren&#x27;t bad, but I picked up this duo at a good price and tried it out.</li>
            <li> I literally find myself racing to put on a smooth coat before it starts to dry.</li>
            <li> I can literally cover any of my nail polishes with this top coat and it covers all of the weird bumps or dings and smooths it out like magic.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s even better because the base coat is included and the price is great.</li>
            <li> Great top and base coats.  </li>
            <li> MAINLY WHY I BUY THEM.</li>
            <li> Great base and top coat.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this pair to anyone who enjoys doing their nails themselves.</li>
            <li> I used the Kleancolor line of metallics (another line I would highly recommend)</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The topcoat doesn&#x27;t dry as fast as the initial use, but is better than the norm.</li>
            <li> I am in love the dry fast top coat, it gives such a shiny effect and dries faast, although the small is really strong!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff stinks like terpentine and is not that effective, though the top coat does dry quickly</li>
            <li> I usually get it for 3 dollars both bottles :) and it drys supper fast</li>
            <li> this gives you a full week long manicure.</li>
            <li> The big plus here is, the top coat dries super fast and rock hard, no smudges.</li>
            <li> the color comes off in a clean single sweep (regardless of color) with no smearing or tinting.</li>
            <li> Let me first say, this really does dry nails FAST.</li>
            <li> I really liked the option of buying both together for a slightly lower price than individually.</li>
            <li> However, the next day, my nails started chipping right away.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s only been a day, but my nails look so fresh and professionally done!</li>
            <li> base coat is fine, top coat peels off easily by day 4.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and you have to work kind of fast when applying it.  </li>
            <li> The base coat protects nails from polish pigments that can stain them, and the top coat ensures that your polish will dry quickly with a beautifully glossy shine in a short period of time.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the product gives a great, smooth shine to my nails and the base works well to prevent staining.</li>
            <li> Seche the quick dry</li>
            <li> so I would definitely keep the top coat tightly closed whenever you do not need it.</li>
            <li> This is a really good base and top coat.  </li>
            <li> Good price for both  base &amp; top coat.  </li>
            <li> Using this duo makes my nail polish last so much longer before chipping!</li>
            <li> I love Seche, especially the top coat which dries the polish in mere minutes.</li>
            <li> I received it today ,and only used top coat on my original polished nails--and it dried in seconds, literally, maybe 20 second--and it was totally dry</li>
            <li> Put that on an old nail color and the shininess beats my newly bought OPI.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why the top coat was thick or the brush was bent since it seemed new, but perhaps it wasn&#x27;t as new as I believed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Usually I like the top coat too, but the bottle I received seemed a bit thick and the brush was slightly bent, The bent brush didn&#x27;t affect putting it on, but the thickness of the top coat meant it didn&#x27;t dry as fast as it normally did</li>
            <li> I wanted to try Seche Vite for a long time and I finally decided to purchase some after seeing how cheap it was on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I could even blow dry my hair and run my freshly painted nails through my hair</li>
            <li> This base coat allows the nail polish to go on and stay on for several days without chipping and the top coat dried quickly and made the nails looks great.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing defiantly get the base and top coat</li>
            <li> Made my nails look professionally done.</li>
            <li> Dries fast and helps color last.</li>
            <li> and my nails always look professionally done.  </li>
            <li> I have no idea what happened as it is not that old.  </li>
            <li> Dries completely within about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Old stock perhaps?</li>
            <li> My nail polish often peeled off completely intact.</li>
            <li> so I had to buy it for old times sake.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I have to say is that the top coat has a very chemically smell when applying it, but the smell goes away once the polish dries.</li>
            <li> wow..</li>
            <li> The top coat is so thick and gummy and stringy</li>
            <li> The base coat is perfect.</li>
            <li> I mean your nails will last until YOU&#x27;RE ready to change them, and who doesn&#x27;t love that?</li>
            <li> (I mean this top coat)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff the base coat and top coat work well to help keep the polish on longer and the dry time is quick.</li>
            <li> The base coat is also very good to keep the main nail color from chipping over time.</li>
            <li> The only reason why it did not get 5 stars is because the top coat seems a little thicker than it should be!</li>
            <li> Never mess up a nail again. ...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t bubble, dries super fast, and you can go about your day almost immediately because it dries hard.</li>
            <li> But the top coat creates ridiculous shine and your nails do dry extremely fast.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Seche is apparently what professional manicurists use and it was reportedly the strongest lacquer I could find.</li>
            <li> I now realized the base and top coat are really important and the quality of the nail polish color doesn&#x27;t matter as much.</li>
            <li> but it definitely cuts down the dry time from two hours to maybe a little less than an hour which is still pretty great.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for the polish to dry fast</li>
            <li> This duo makes my nail polish dry much faster, and my nail polish lasts longer.</li>
            <li> If it remains this price or at least cheaper than in the store I will most definitely purchase again.  </li>
            <li> If you need a fast drying top coat--this is the one, you will not got wrong.</li>
            <li> Also, my friend had the top coat and left it open for a little too long and it got really goopy and gross</li>
            <li> overall I&#x27;m happy with it especially since it&#x27;s probably difficult to find in stores that I regularly go to...</li>
            <li> Worst of all, the top coat got incredibly gloopy after just having it a few weeks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-top coat is thick and also goes on smoothly and evenly</li>
            <li> I was hoping for the high gloss finish to last a couple of days, but, it does get dull just like any other top coat.  </li>
            <li> This is the only fast dry topcoat I will ever use.  </li>
            <li> : Doesn&#x27;t last very long, shine wears off, the top coat is very thick and it tends to make my polish &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; off instead of chip like normal.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised at how fast it dried</li>
            <li> Finally, I have learned that the key to chip/peeling prevention is to start with a very dry nail (can be accomplished with a quick rub with witch hazel) and put the base coat both on top and bottom of your nail.  </li>
            <li> The base and top coat are great, however, once it gets a little old it gets thick.</li>
            <li> I add a little bit and its brand new again!!</li>
            <li> It has a super shiny, fast dry finish and can be layered for nail art or left in on thin coat for a very sheer, shiny finish on any polish.</li>
            <li> Hands down my favorite brand of base and top coat.</li>
            <li> The base holds polish well and the top coat dries incredibly quickly.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have with these bottles is that my bottle of top coat is only half gone, but I&#x27;m already finding it hard to get the brush to reach the product to get enough on the brush.</li>
            <li> super shinny and thick enough to cover all the glitter or designs to make a flat cover.</li>
            <li> I polish my nails much more often now that it doesn&#x27;t mean carving out a few hours of my day.</li>
            <li> Years ago I bought just the top coat and was disappointed when my nails started to chip after only 3 days, not to mention it went &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34; incredibly fast.</li>
            <li> This keeps my nails from chipping for days longer than any other I&#x27;ve tried so far.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is if ur bottom coats thick and isn&#x27;t dry when u put the top coat on you&#x27;ll still mess it up if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li> It gives a food, long lasting manicure.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last as long as the claims stated.</li>
            <li> To get the long lasting effect on my fingernails, I went shopping for Seche Vite lacquer.  </li>
            <li> your nails design last for a long time 💅</li>
            <li> last a long time!</li>
            <li> My nail colors last a very long time with this</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it gets really gloopy even when I use the thinner.  </li>
            <li> My nails don&#x27;t get yellow and they dry in 20 minutes with two coats of color.  </li>
            <li> I am using it now with Essie, which has a terrible dry time without a top coat, and it is going strong.</li>
            <li> Helps polish dry faster and last twice as long.</li>
            <li> The top coat smells STRONG and is a horrible scent - I&#x27;ve tried several top coats and I&#x27;ve never come across a polish that smells so bad.  </li>
            <li> in all, I am glad I bought this duo, mainly for the base coat this time.  </li>
            <li> I can use it on my toes, but it is a nightmare on my fingernails as they are long.</li>
            <li> and it takes a long time before you begin to see wear in your manicure.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find that the base coat protects my natural nail from getting stained or from peeling, and the top coat helps the nail polish last longer and leaves a shine that I always prefer.</li>
            <li> You should really purchase the restore so you can loosen up the polish from being thick.</li>
            <li> but this base coat is good too.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it to invest in a nicer base and top coat and have fun with less expensive nail polish</li>
            <li> I will be a life long customer!</li>
            <li> Just lay it on and within 2 minutes your nails are dry.</li>
            <li> I have neither the patience or the grace to wait for polish to dry.</li>
            <li> It even covers the bumps and nicks on my nails from my clumsiness while waiting for them to dry.</li>
            <li> Usually even by the second day they are already a bit dull looking and not as shiny or glossy as when I first applied</li>
            <li> and my entire manicure was completed in ten minutes, from base coat to polish to top coat.  </li>
            <li> My manicure lasts twice as long when using the base and top coats!</li>
            <li> This stuff dries really fast and is hard as a rock!</li>
            <li> I finished my nails and less than 10 minutes later I was changing my clothes and tying my shoes.</li>
            <li> I have had mine now for just over two weeks and have used it twice - each time the topcoat was dry in roughly 5 minutes</li>
            <li> I expected it to last at least 5-7 days without major peeling or chipping.</li>
            <li> Such a deal, so I got the base coat and top coat duo for around 8 dollars plus shipping my total was less than 20 USD</li>
            <li> overall, love Seche Vite, very disappointed with Seche Clear.</li>
            <li> So far I am not thrilled though</li>
            <li> The only thing I did not like after a few days my nail polish started to chip</li>
            <li> I had painted my nails and they were still too wet when I went to bed</li>
            <li> Approximately 1.5 weeks later at standard international shipping--</li>
            <li> The Seche clear is a fantastic base coat</li>
            <li> This top coat and base coat makes my polish peel the very next day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to have found this base and clear coat combination!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rough on my nails with all the knitting, crafting, and other things I do.</li>
            <li> Plus, the quick-dry function means I can paint my nails in 20 minutes (base, color, and topcoat) and after waiting half an hour (just to be safe), I can touch things without worrying about smudges!</li>
            <li> But with Seche Vite my nails were completely dry in seriously less than 5 minutes and SO SHINY and GLOSSY.</li>
            <li> The base coat paints on a little thin and dries a little matte, which when I first used it was unsure of how well it was going to work, but it definitely helps the color adhere to the nail better.</li>
            <li> (it makes a difference to use it when the nail polish is still somewhat wet because it shrinks up a little bit when applied to dry nail polish).</li>
            <li> Other than that..</li>
            <li> Compared to all other base/top coats I have ever used, my nail polish always lasts the longest with Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> As in the past (until this purchase) I will continue to purchase through my local distributor.</li>
            <li> Usually when I paint my nails they begin to chip just 2 days later.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed ladies, give it a try :)</li>
            <li> Spray lacquer is usually used on brass and such to keep from tarnishing.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what nail salons use and it is really expensive anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I ran out of my other base coat and my seche vite top coat, so I bought this duo.</li>
            <li> One thing I noticed, is that it&#x27;s easier to take my dark polishes OFF when I&#x27;ve used this base/top coat combo.</li>
            <li> It also makes your manicure last at least a week without chipping.</li>
            <li> The health risk are not worth it for a shine.  </li>
            <li> But, obviously using a spray on a small item like a pendant is a waste.</li>
            <li> I just used the base as a top coat as well.</li>
            <li> However received a opi top coat instead of a seche base coat.</li>
            <li> I love this base coat and will continue to use</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy both the base and top coat however as I like the products.</li>
            <li> You can paint the base coat on all your nails, then your color, and then almost immediately the top coat.</li>
            <li> but I needed a base and top coat</li>
            <li> I did not have any luck with the base or top coat.</li>
            <li> This top and base coat set make my manicure last for at least a week without chipping.</li>
            <li> The base coat does protect the nail from polish staining but the top coat does nothing but make the nail shine.</li>
            <li> I gave the base coat away, but kept the top coat.</li>
            <li> but I think this helps the base coat act more like a bond/glue</li>
            <li> I put my layer of base coat on, followed by two coats of Essie nail polish, then finished with the top coat.</li>
            <li> , that is until I thinned it down a bit with some polish thinner.  </li>
            <li> but I think I&#x27;ve got it down</li>
            <li> Bubbles a little bit if you don&#x27;t apply it very carefully,</li>
            <li> /&gt;-ENTIRE NAIL IS DRY IN LESS THAN 5 MINUTES!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even half way through it</li>
            <li> I expect chips after 5-7 days, but a day &amp; a half?</li>
            <li> Where have it been all my previous life???</li>
            <li> I put on 3 coats on each side of each medal, which used half the bottle.</li>
            <li> Not once since using this product has my polish stained my acrylics, and taking dark polish off is less messy.  </li>
            <li> The base coat is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I can go on about my business in less then a minute, and after a few minutes, I need not worry about &amp;#34;denting&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I share my nail stuff with my little girl</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed that the base coat wasn&#x27;t in a box and only wrapped in the invoice paper, but it was still intact and no spilling, so I&#x27;m still a happy customer.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind a little wear at the tips (which comes no matter what brand you use)</li>
            <li> I DID A MANICURE WITH THESE 2 LITTLE GUYS</li>
            <li> Usually when wearing dark colors when taking off the polish it smears and makes a mess on my fingers, and stains my acrylics.  </li>
            <li> The base coat works fine.</li>
            <li> and I just got them a few minutes ago.</li>
            <li> the base coat is light.</li>
            <li> I ordered the top coat and base coat duo because I was really unhappy with a combination base coat and top coat which took forever to dry.  </li>
            <li> Seriously dries my nails in a fraction of other &amp;#34;fast dry&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The base coat peels off quickly</li>
            <li> The base coat dries quick, but after one day my nails chipped using both these items with two coats of polish.  </li>
            <li> After that, it was the usual 3 mins or so.  </li>
            <li> on the other hand, does not get gloopy (at least for me) and it works well too!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s up.  </li>
            <li> I usually do my nails at night</li>
            <li> It is not really healthy for nails</li>
            <li> And after 3-4 days there is chipping occurring but for me not much of a problem since im obsessed with doing my nails over and over.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been doing anything crazy and I have short nails</li>
            <li> and I have to wait at least an hour or so before attempting to go to bed</li>
            <li> one complaint:</li>
            <li> Covers imperfections with a glossy thick coat.</li>
            <li> The base coat does prevent your polish from chipping as fast.</li>
            <li> Also, the base coat is more watery than I expected (I&#x27;m used to a thicker base coat consistency)</li>
            <li> I always use a base coat with darker polishes, but I am surprised at how much less work (and fewer cotton balls!)</li>
            <li> After using the Crystal Clear Base, this is a thing of the past.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that the base coat feels a little gritty to the touch after it dries, but that doesn&#x27;t affect its performance.</li>
            <li> Only used a little of the base coat.</li>
            <li> it is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used less expensive</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> With Seche Clear as the base coat, my nail polish peeled off in one piece...</li>
            <li> Definitely try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> so they got all gross like they do when you do something stupid like that.</li>
            <li> so i went back to sally hensen base coat.</li>
            <li> used the base enough to give a review.</li>
            <li> There is no staining even with dark colors with this base coat.  </li>
            <li> The base coat was average.</li>
            <li> The previous week, I used a Sally Hansen base coat/top coat along with Essie nail polish and my nails were chip-free for a week.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical</li>
            <li> some of my nail polishes weren&#x27;t expensive or</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed; I can&#x27;t imagine I&#x27;m doing anything wrong?</li>
            <li> The brush for the base coat came damaged, and sometimes makes using it a bit difficult.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed</li>
            <li> However, I was disappointed when I received two Seche Vite topcoats instead of a topcoat and basecoat set with this order.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m always worried about sheet marks on my nails in the morning :(</li>
            <li> Mine came with two base coats-</li>
            <li> Still waiting on the base coat.</li>
            <li> and I noticed that it was to base coat that was chipping off my polish from the bottom.</li>
            <li> As recommended on a YouTube review video that I watched, I paint the base coat on my nails, wait five minutes before painting my nails with whatever nail polish</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be prepared for the base coat however</li>
            <li> and it needs to be thinned every use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base coat,</li>
            <li> The base coat seems to work and we&#x27;ll see if it prevents yellowing with the darker polishes,  </li>
            <li> I used the base coat, 2 coats polish (not fancy polish)</li>
            <li> The base coat is, you know, a base coat.</li>
            <li> i dont use the base coat, i use a supper adhesion base coat...</li>
            <li> I probably don&#x27;t need the base coat for this purpose.</li>
            <li> Anyways, the bottle with the base coat came with no brush, how am I suppose to use it?</li>
            <li> I use to hate doing my nails at home because they would smudge before drying all the way and chip a day after applying, with this combo</li>
            <li> Terrible product.</li>
            <li> I have a terrible time with chipped nails between bartending and typing at my full-time job, so to have a home manicure that doesn&#x27;t chip after a couple hours</li>
            <li> It also sticks horribly of toluene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff dries nails fast. Other than that.. It is just like any other bottom and top coat.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, the Seche Vite top coat and base coat are the best EVER! A total necessity for anyone painting their nails. I find that the base coat protects my natural nail from getting stained or from peeling, and the top coat helps the nail polish last longer and leaves a shine that I always prefer. I really liked the option of buying both together for a slightly lower price than individually. Great purchase each and every time.</li>
            <li> I have tried man quick dries and this is the best ever.  This is a must have.  The price is just remarkable</li>
            <li> Mine came with two base coats- but that&#x27;s okay- I just used the base as a top coat as well. It is AMAZING!!!! It dries in 5 min and just makes the nails POP with color. They look shiny and awesome. 100% recommend!</li>
            <li> I heard so many nice things about this. It probably does make your nails pretty and shiny, but so do a bunch of others with no Toluene. I didn&#x27;t find out about that until after I ordered it. Yuck. I share my nail stuff with my little girl and I try not to put known poisons or carcinogens on either one of us, especially her. Not used.</li>
            <li> The top coat dries your nail polish really quickly but I find my polish does not last more than 3 days when I use this. I expected it to last at least 5-7 days without major peeling or chipping.</li>
            <li> I first saw these at a Sally&#x27;s Beauty and picked them up. The rumors are true, the best coats to use for polish lovers. The top is really fast not like others which say they are but actually not. They are lovely to use. And make my nails feel silky. Will always buy this product.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this product. Please keep making that top coat forever! Dries my nails instantly and it is SUPER DUPER shiny! Put that on an old nail color and the shininess beats my newly bought OPI. It&#x27;s also very sturdy and doesn&#x27;t smell very strong. Received compliments and had been asked about the brand of the nail polish I used. I am extremely satisfied and will recommend it to anyone! This is in fact my first ever Amazon review after all these years shopping online, but I just absolutely felt the need to write this review as the product is so wonderful, and I truly hope you will enjoy it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> I can now do my own nails now and they dry quickly and looking smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li> Not too impressed so far I&#x27;ve had to re polish my nails twice in less than a week . Disappointed</li>
            <li> This set is great! fast shipping and wrapped perfectly so there was not way it would break. The base coat works fine. The top coat is the best top coat i have ever used! super shinny and thick enough to cover all the glitter or designs to make a flat cover. The only problem i have is that it has an insanely strong smell when applying and remains with a smell on my nails. And after 3-4 days there is chipping occurring but for me not much of a problem since im obsessed with doing my nails over and over. So as much as i love this, it lost one star on the smell and the chipping!</li>
            <li> The base and top coat are great, however, once it gets a little old it gets thick. You should really purchase the restore so you can loosen up the polish from being thick. It also have the polish to chip in about a day. If you&#x27;re looking for the polish to dry fast this is what you need the Top coat.</li>
            <li> Seriously my favorite basecoat/top coat duo EVER. Shipped quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd set, and I have also given a couple of sets as gifts. Hands down my favorite brand of base and top coat.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff the base coat and top coat work well to help keep the polish on longer and the dry time is quick.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> I have tried several brands, and nothing works as well as these! I can literally cover any of my nail polishes with this top coat and it covers all of the weird bumps or dings and smooths it out like magic. Love this stuff!! Compared to all other base/top coats I have ever used, my nail polish always lasts the longest with Seche Vite. Would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> This top coat is amazing! Seriously dries my nails in a fraction of other &amp;#34;fast dry&amp;#34; top coats. I polish my nails much more often now that it doesn&#x27;t mean carving out a few hours of my day. Definitely try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Made my nails look professionally done.</li>
            <li> This brand makes the very best nail products. Polish goes on smooth and dries quickly. It gives a food, long lasting manicure.</li>
            <li> Quick drying and clear.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!! Will reorder when needed. After 5 minutes you can do anything you need to do!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best fast drying top coat on the market! It is a must have! Just lay it on and within 2 minutes your nails are dry.</li>
            <li> Love it as always.  Have purchased many bottles of Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used yet but I see from you tube that a lot of ladies use this and love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been painting my nails twice a week for the last 20 years. Finally a product that will make my polish last a long time! I love this!</li>
            <li> This stuff stinks like terpentine and is not that effective, though the top coat does dry quickly</li>
            <li> my girlfriend loved, she said she would use again.</li>
            <li> Best I have ever used and got it at a steal!!</li>
            <li> base coat is fine, top coat peels off easily by day 4. i can just hold a tip of it and it peels off.</li>
            <li> I ran out of my other base coat and my seche vite top coat, so I bought this duo. The base coat is okay, but the top coat is by far the best out there. It has a super shiny, fast dry finish and can be layered for nail art or left in on thin coat for a very sheer, shiny finish on any polish.</li>
            <li> Love it. Dries fast and helps color last.</li>
            <li> I was always on the fence about seche vite as I heard conflicting reviews about it but I figured everyone&#x27;s opinions vary. I LOVE the product and even better that I was able to find it for a cheaper price. I received the email this morning that they shipped the product and I just got them a few minutes ago. Great seller and customer service, super fast shipping! Thank you!!!!</li>
            <li> Give my nails a very shining look. The only thing I did not like after a few days my nail polish started to chip but I believe it comes from washing my hands and dishes often. overall I love the product one of the best base coat and top coat i ever owned</li>
            <li> Top coat is amazing. Dries fast looks shiny. However received a opi top coat instead of a seche base coat. Still waiting on the base coat.</li>
            <li> One of the Best Nail Products out there! It really works!</li>
            <li> I am in love the dry fast top coat, it gives such a shiny effect and dries faast, although the small is really strong!&lt;br /&gt;After 4 uses I noticed that my nail polish was chipping off and I noticed that it was to base coat that was chipping off my polish from the bottom. One of my clients told me that their polish chipped off so i went back to sally hensen base coat.</li>
            <li> Love this combo. I did my nails two days after I received this (March 5th) and it&#x27;s about two weeks later now (March 22nd) and they&#x27;re just starting to chip. I&#x27;m sincerely impressed with the longevity of this stuff though I will say they definitely seem to work much better as a pair. Years ago I bought just the top coat and was disappointed when my nails started to chip after only 3 days, not to mention it went &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34; incredibly fast. So I&#x27;ve sworn off of this brand for a while. Curiosity and the price (HELLOOO SAVINGS) that you get for the two of these brought me back. This duo! SO good! My nails still have a glossed effect, and like I said IT&#x27;S BEEN TWO WEEKS. I highly recommend this pair to anyone who enjoys doing their nails themselves. I mean your nails will last until YOU&#x27;RE ready to change them, and who doesn&#x27;t love that? Great buy!</li>
            <li> This is a really good base and top coat.  The base coat is easy to apply. It has a nice shine on its own and polish goes on nice and smooth. There is no staining even with dark colors with this base coat.  The top coat has a learning curve though.  It is very thick and you have to work kind of fast when applying it.  The brush is curved- so that is different too.  But the top coat creates ridiculous shine and your nails do dry extremely fast.  I can paint my nails at night, go to bed, and not worry about smudging or smearing. I use this with glitter polishes and it creates a nice protective film over the glitter and nail art.  This doesn&#x27;t chip, flake, or peel.  You have to let your polish grow out.  It also makes really cheap polishes look high end and my nails always look professionally done.  7/21/15 I took away two stars. The top coat is so thick and gummy and stringy it is ridiculous. And the bottle is not even halfway finished yet. I have no idea what happened as it is not that old.  I can use it on my toes, but it is a nightmare on my fingernails as they are long.</li>
            <li> If you do your own nails or would like to start, you need both of these products.  I never did my own nails.  Once I bought these, it made my paint jobs look great.  The more you do your own nails, the better you get and these two products make it easier.</li>
            <li> I am a nail polish fanatic and own many various colors.  Usually when wearing dark colors when taking off the polish it smears and makes a mess on my fingers, and stains my acrylics.  After using the Crystal Clear Base, this is a thing of the past.  Not once since using this product has my polish stained my acrylics, and taking dark polish off is less messy.  I love this base coat and will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Usually I like the top coat too, but the bottle I received seemed a bit thick and the brush was slightly bent, The bent brush didn&#x27;t affect putting it on, but the thickness of the top coat meant it didn&#x27;t dry as fast as it normally did, that is until I thinned it down a bit with some polish thinner.  After that, it was the usual 3 mins or so.  I don&#x27;t know why the top coat was thick or the brush was bent since it seemed new, but perhaps it wasn&#x27;t as new as I believed.  That&#x27;s just a guess.  I&#x27;m not saying this was the case.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am glad I bought this duo, mainly for the base coat this time.  I will continue to buy both the base and top coat however as I like the products.</li>
            <li> Polish dries quickly with top coat!</li>
            <li> Strong smell but which nail polish doesn&#x27;t have that smell? Otherwise, these are the best base coat and top coat I&#x27;ve ever used. The top coat stays glossy and chip free for days.</li>
            <li> Use this when I paint my nails.  People always think I have Gel fingernail polish.</li>
            <li> It works. Makes polishing nails so easy and not to worry about them smudging. You can polish them before bed and have no worries about sheet marks. It is a miracle.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! Works well!</li>
            <li> I use this on my 2 year old who loves to wear polish., hoping to protect her nails and still make the polish stay on for more than a couple days. It makes a HUGE difference. I only put on 1 coat of OPI polish and it&#x27;s lasted a week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a fabulous deal at 7.95 for the bottom and top coat! It dries very quickly. She&#x27;s had no problems of discoloration</li>
            <li> LOVE these polishes. I will not go back to using regular top coat, this stuff works like magic. I will continue to buy these from now on!!</li>
            <li> dries super fast. it gives your nails a nice shine. the base coat is light. every woman should own these products</li>
            <li> But not as great as I thought it would be. Didn&#x27;t last as long as the claims stated. I found that my nails chipped after the third or fourth day and  with some polishes, even sooner. And the top coats smell was extremely potent and had the habit of drying out to a goop very quickly. So if you purchase this, be sure to purchase the Seche Restore as well to thin it out!</li>
            <li> Never mess up a nail again. ...love this top coat...haven&#x27;t used the base enough to give a review. Sry</li>
            <li> I love these products. I have used them before. This topcoat is the best there is.  However, I was disappointed when I received two Seche Vite topcoats instead of a topcoat and basecoat set with this order. I will use the topcoat as it is wonderful, but now I am left without a basecoat.&lt;br /&gt;However, it was fine. The seller was very prompt in a response and refunded my money.</li>
            <li> AMAZING. Using this duo makes my nail polish last so much longer before chipping! I easily get a week out of OPI manicures, and 4-5 days on cheap drugstore-brand manicures. Plus, the quick-dry function means I can paint my nails in 20 minutes (base, color, and topcoat) and after waiting half an hour (just to be safe), I can touch things without worrying about smudges! I&#x27;m definitely gifting this set to my girlfriends that like to paint their nails!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several years and will never use another top coat.  It dries my polish quickly and leaves it gorgeous and shiny.  I find that it actually enhances my nail colour.  I&#x27;ve ordered it for friends and they all love it too.  Nothing compares to this!</li>
            <li> The Seche clear is a fantastic base coat but i would not consider buying Seche Vite. The Seche Vite would chip my manicure the first day.Would not reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> This top coat and base coat makes my polish peel the very next day. I will just stick to OPI!</li>
            <li> i really prefer to do my own nails, however nothing bugs me quite like spending a half an hour or more shaping, filing, and painting my nails and then smudging them after I think they are dry...ugh!!! You can paint the base coat on all your nails, then your color, and then almost immediately the top coat. The big plus here is, the top coat dries super fast and rock hard, no smudges. I finished my nails and less than 10 minutes later I was changing my clothes and tying my shoes. I have used all types of polish with this duo, cheap drugstore polish to Essie and OPI, and it doesn&#x27;t matter. This product makes every polish perform.</li>
            <li> My manicure lasts twice as long when using the base and top coats!</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE MY Seche Vite set it is so fabulous I also bought the nail paint thinner so when it starts to get gooey I add a little bit and its brand new again!! It makes painting my nails so much easier and five times faster drying time! Will ONLY EVER USE Seche Vite! Life changer!!</li>
            <li> This is by and far my favorite top coat. It goes on so smooth, and keeps my manicure shiny for days! I re-apply the top coat once a week and can keep my nails from chipping for quite a while. The base coat is also very good to keep the main nail color from chipping over time. An unbeatable combination!</li>
            <li> I have neither the patience or the grace to wait for polish to dry. I always ruin it. I&#x27;ve used less expensive (Sally Hansen) top coats, they weren&#x27;t bad, but I picked up this duo at a good price and tried it out. Let me first say, this really does dry nails FAST. I can go on about my business in less then a minute, and after a few minutes, I need not worry about &amp;#34;denting&amp;#34; the polish. I have only used the two together, so I can&#x27;t say whether the top coat works well on its own, I&#x27;ve been told it really does work best when you use them together. Also, you NEED to put the top coat on while polish is still wet. It is nice and shiny, and doesn&#x27;t chip easily. One thing I noticed, is that it&#x27;s easier to take my dark polishes OFF when I&#x27;ve used this base/top coat combo. I always use a base coat with darker polishes, but I am surprised at how much less work (and fewer cotton balls!) I need to use when I&#x27;ve used the Seche combo.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for seche, since they get such great reviews, but my polish alone with no topcoat lasts longer than with the seche vite, it does dry fast, but the tips wear quickly and the polish starts peeling after only a day. Terrible product. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> Awesome top coat. Helps polish dry faster and last twice as long. Super shiney, easy to apply. Great product! Love it.</li>
            <li> I use this every time I paint my nails, and it does the job perfectly. As recommended on a YouTube review video that I watched, I paint the base coat on my nails, wait five minutes before painting my nails with whatever nail polish I&#x27;m using, and then apply the topcoat shortly after (it makes a difference to use it when the nail polish is still somewhat wet because it shrinks up a little bit when applied to dry nail polish). This duo makes my nail polish dry much faster, and my nail polish lasts longer. I noticed that the base coat feels a little gritty to the touch after it dries, but that doesn&#x27;t affect its performance.</li>
            <li> This is the only fast dry topcoat I will ever use.  I&#x27;ve used just about every topcoat on the market and Seche is by far the best and dries even faster than others that claim the same outcome.  I have had mine now for just over two weeks and have used it twice - each time the topcoat was dry in roughly 5 minutes and I was able to go about my day within 30 with no worry.  It is incredibly glossy - almost like glass and adds a lusciousness to the color that I&#x27;ve yet to see with others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be prepared for the base coat however, it is thinner than you would expect but dries incredibly quick.  Within a couple of minutes after I did the last nail, I was able to begin applying my polish.  I used the Kleancolor line of metallics (another line I would highly recommend) and my entire manicure was completed in ten minutes, from base coat to polish to top coat.  The colors have stayed true, no chipping and it takes a long time before you begin to see wear in your manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I intend to get the Seche polish thinner and the topcoat refill kit.  They&#x27;ve impressed me a great deal.</li>
            <li> Love it! Dries very fast.. I have tried sally hansen before and it smudges my nail color, this doesn&#x27;t. Very glossy finish. Recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works SO well. Dries completely within about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and was super excited to try this.  However, my Sally Hansen top coat seems to prolong my nailpolish more than this duo of base and top coat.  I am going to try it more and see if it was just a one off situation, but otherwise I had higher expectations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to have found this base and clear coat combination!  I first used it with super cheap red color on my toenails and the color looks like gel and has lasted 2 weeks without chipping! To get the long lasting effect on my fingernails, I went shopping for Seche Vite lacquer.  Two days with the bright and colorful Iconic paired with this base and top coat and only one tiny chip.  Make sure to follow directions to liberally use the top coat or you&#x27;ll take the polish right off.  Also, use acetone polish remover or it will take forever to get this stuff off.  If you have bright colors, start by putting vaseline all around your nail to avoid the color bleeding all over your skin.  Finally, I have learned that the key to chip/peeling prevention is to start with a very dry nail (can be accomplished with a quick rub with witch hazel) and put the base coat both on top and bottom of your nail.  Then polish and top coat.  I have a new addiction with these nice polishes!!</li>
            <li> Very nice and quick to dry</li>
            <li> I love this base coat and top coat, really makes my mani&#x27;s beautiful! Top coat dries super fast so I can put it on even if I am running out the door!</li>
            <li> Excellent top coat that dries my nail polish in seconds!  My only complaint is that it gets really gloopy even when I use the thinner.  I&#x27;m not even half way through it and it needs to be thinned every use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base coat, on the other hand, does not get gloopy (at least for me) and it works well too!</li>
            <li> This stuff rocks!  I was skeptical but I needed a base and top coat so I figured why not.  The top coat really does enable you to get on with your life shortly after you apply it.  The base coat seems to work and we&#x27;ll see if it prevents yellowing with the darker polishes,  overall I&#x27;m happy with it especially since it&#x27;s probably difficult to find in stores that I regularly go to...</li>
            <li> These two work well together. Good for an at home or at the salon mani pedi. The topcoat doesn&#x27;t dry as fast as the initial use, but is better than the norm.</li>
            <li> Everyone seems to love these, but I don&#x27;t really see anything special about them. My polish doesn&#x27;t seem any shiner or more lasting than with the cheap stuff. Worst of all, the top coat got incredibly gloopy after just having it a few weeks. I still use it because the finish is fine, but there will be stings of polish actually trailing from the bottle to my nails that I have to clean off the table!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going with the cheapo stuff next time.</li>
            <li> The best base and top coat ever!  I&#x27;ve tried many others and none of them have ever compared.  The top coat dries INSTANTLY! You never have to worry about messing up your nails after painting them.  Also, you will never get marks or nicks from your pillows or whatever else.  It also makes your manicure last at least a week without chipping. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I Love the top coat --it drys fast.  Good price for both  base &amp; top coat.  I was surprised how quickly I received it !</li>
            <li> I bought this because the reviews looked pretty decent.  I used the base coat, 2 coats polish (not fancy polish) then the Seche UV topcoat with my Royal Natils UV light.  I have not yet used the topcoat in this set.  Here&#x27;s the deal, I did my nails Tuesday morning at 9am, and by Wednesday at 6pm there was a piece that had flaked off.  Today is Thursday, and as I just went to fix the one index finger, I noticed that 3 more nails with the product lifting off!  I haven&#x27;t been doing anything crazy and I have short nails so I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s up.  SO, I will try it again with a different brand of polish, and instead of my UV topcoat I will use the top coat in this set then I will review again.  So far I am not thrilled though, I decided to stop getting manis at the salon because I have the time and actually enjoy doing it myself but this is just way too much maintenence.  I expect chips after 5-7 days, but a day &amp; a half?</li>
            <li> The base coat peels off quickly and I don&#x27;t use it anymore. But I love the top coat. It dries very fast and smooth. It even covers the bumps and nicks on my nails from my clumsiness while waiting for them to dry. I will definitely buy it again when mine is gone. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The very best nail polish out there and great base coat too.</li>
            <li> I recommend these for anyone! Very professional products!The top coat is a bit smelly so make sure to do it in a well ventilated area!</li>
            <li> I love Seche, especially the top coat which dries the polish in mere minutes.</li>
            <li> This is the best base and top coat out there. It dries any type of nail polish that I put on underneath. I am almost done using my first two bottles, so I&#x27;ll be ordering more!</li>
            <li> Old stock perhaps? I have always used Seche Vite (15 years in business and always have loved it). The caps even came apart from the brush attachment. As in the past (until this purchase) I will continue to purchase through my local distributor.</li>
            <li> Just received them today and I can&#x27;t wait to use them. I&#x27;ve heard good things about this product and I hope it serves me as well as those who&#x27;ve used them before me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these two products for more than a year now and I love both of them. The top coat dries really fast and leaves a nice finish.</li>
            <li> Two very handy products that I found here that save me expensive trips to the nail salon - because they&#x27;re exactly what THEY use!  The base coat protects nails from polish pigments that can stain them, and the top coat ensures that your polish will dry quickly with a beautifully glossy shine in a short period of time. Two timesavers that will be greatly appreciated, and they got to me on time as well. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> The base coat is, you know, a base coat. It&#x27;s pretty decent. But this top coat, though. It&#x27;s great. Covers imperfections with a glossy thick coat. It&#x27;s niiiiceee. Like magic. Seriously. I had painted my nails and they were still too wet when I went to bed so they got all gross like they do when you do something stupid like that. Covered them up with a coat of this top coat in the morning and you would never have guessed that I messed up my nails the night before. They looked salon perfect.</li>
            <li> It was worth what I paid for it.  Just doesn&#x27;t work any better than any other brand I ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping,it dries very fast, thx</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat you can own. It dry fast and had a beautiful shine almost like uv gel.</li>
            <li> Bubbles a little bit if you don&#x27;t apply it very carefully, very high shine gloss though. These products work well together.</li>
            <li> I did not have any luck with the base or top coat. My polish still chipped after a couple of days.</li>
            <li> Love the top coat!  Dries your nails in minutes!</li>
            <li> Girls best friend! Enough said</li>
            <li> Seche is the best of the best! Using this top/bottom coat, I don&#x27;t have to repolish my nails for 10-14 days. LOVE IT! It makes any nail polish look 10x better when you apply the top coat.</li>
            <li> Hands-down, best base and top coat I&#x27;ve ever used.  Doesn&#x27;t bubble, dries super fast, and you can go about your day almost immediately because it dries hard.</li>
            <li> This top coat is the best there is. Even professionals use this product. I found out about this top coat because my nail tech uses the product. My nails always look great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already bought a bottle of the top coat prior to this purchase and loved it. Now it&#x27;s even better because the base coat is included and the price is great. One bottle can easily cost $8, so getting two for $9.50 is a steal! I was a little disappointed that the base coat wasn&#x27;t in a box and only wrapped in the invoice paper, but it was still intact and no spilling, so I&#x27;m still a happy customer. 😄</li>
            <li> Nothing like Seche Vite products!  The base coat does prevent your polish from chipping as fast. The top coat is the best in the world! Fast drying with an excellent shine!! Keeps your nails looking fresh for weeks! I am so very happy that I tried this product.  I will be a life long customer!</li>
            <li> I ordered the top coat and base coat duo because I was really unhappy with a combination base coat and top coat which took forever to dry.  The top coat is fast drying and leaves a really shiny finish.</li>
            <li> Great top and base coats.  Drys quickly and makes nails shine.  I would definitely buy these nail products again.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Instead of hours it takes minutes to do my mani.</li>
            <li> This product was referred to me by a friend and I absolutely love them!. The top coat is awesome, it dries quickly within like 3 minutes. It leaves a glossy shine as if its gel polish.</li>
            <li> Seche isn&#x27;t a good product.  My polish still came off.</li>
            <li> Awesome base and top coat. Nails stay strong and color last for days.  A must have for anyone who love to paint their nail and not worry about chipping.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite top coat I wouldn&#x27;t pay that much money for it tho I usually get it for 3 dollars both bottles :) and it drys supper fast your nails design last for a long time 💅</li>
            <li> I was hoping for the high gloss finish to last a couple of days, but, it does get dull just like any other top coat.  It does provide nice coverage when applying with the brush - smooth finish.</li>
            <li> Glad I found SECHE!  DRIES SO VERY QUICKLY; AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;JUST BOUGHT MORE TO HAVE!  ALSO SENT TO SOMEONE ELSE I CARE ABOUT.</li>
            <li> These are the best I have ever used. Usually when I paint my nails they begin to chip just 2 days later. This top and base coat set make my manicure last for at least a week without chipping. I absolutely love them!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and drys so fast!</li>
            <li> I found this after watching many videos regarding nail care and I am not impressed. The base coat does protect the nail from polish staining but the top coat does nothing but make the nail shine. My nail polish often peeled off completely intact. I have had to polish my nails twice or more in one week. The health risk are not worth it for a shine.  Health risk of birth defects printed on bottle.</li>
            <li> GREAT product. My nail polish lasts for 3-5 days without chipping.</li>
            <li> Had this quick dry product applied by my manicurist and loved it. It drys amazingly fast. Purchasing it on Amazon was great. Good price with free shipping. Can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Have been wanting to try this for months but couldn&#x27;t bring myself to drop $10 per bottle..well I checked walmart last night and it was more like $8.98.  Love the deal I got online here.  If it remains this price or at least cheaper than in the store I will most definitely purchase again.  For me it keeps my nail polish on until I am ready to take it off.</li>
            <li> Not durable - and I wear gloves while washing my dishes.</li>
            <li> Best base coat and top coat ever. The seller was super fast shipping it.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff...makes my mani look great...leaves it so shiny and beautiful...i dont use the base coat, i use a supper adhesion base coat...but this base coat is good too.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE PRICE- MAINLY WHY I BUY THEM. THEY ARE NICE AND HOLD ON TO YOUR NAIL POLISH. DOESN&#x27;T CHIP AS FAST. WONDERFUL PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used Seche product and have never heard of it. But chose these because of their good reviews and it is truly the best base coat i&#x27;ve tried. i really recommend it.</li>
            <li> The top coat smells STRONG and is a horrible scent - I&#x27;ve tried several top coats and I&#x27;ve never come across a polish that smells so bad.  The base coat dries quick, but after one day my nails chipped using both these items with two coats of polish.  I&#x27;m disappointed; I can&#x27;t imagine I&#x27;m doing anything wrong?</li>
            <li> drys fast n don,t chip fast.</li>
            <li> Works really well. Actually dries fast and still shines!!! Not to mention it arrived quickly and the seller responds fast too!</li>
            <li> This keeps my nails from chipping for days longer than any other I&#x27;ve tried so far.  If you don&#x27;t mind a little wear at the tips (which comes no matter what brand you use) this gives you a full week long manicure.</li>
            <li> I DID A MANICURE WITH THESE 2 LITTLE GUYS AND IT LAST FOR 3+ DAYS, I WAS SHOCKED BUT HAPPY, THIS IS WITH WASHING DISHES AND EVEYTHING, GREAT PRODUCT, DEFINETLY BUYING THE BIGGER SIZE NEXT TIME</li>
            <li> I wanted to try Seche Vite for a long time and I finally decided to purchase some after seeing how cheap it was on Amazon. Shipping was fast and all and it arrived in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Pretty shiny, dries polish fast, protects nails&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Doesn&#x27;t last very long, shine wears off, the top coat is very thick and it tends to make my polish &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; off instead of chip like normal.</li>
            <li> Both products work as claimed.  Easy to apply and dry quickly.  The top coat shines, protects well and ling lasting.</li>
            <li> Definitely going to keep on buying this! Perfect for a nail fanatic like me. Both dry so quickly which I love. The top coat keeps my nails from chipping.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE the Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat because it really does dry you nails sooooo much faster than any other top coat I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I gave the base coat away, but kept the top coat. So glad I did because it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I tend to paint my nails at night and would wake up all messed up but this dries my nails within two mins max! Also nails are so shiny as if I just got back from getting them done.</li>
            <li> My favorite base/ top coat to date, but it can get a little pricey. I was so excited to find it for a better price on Amazon. The base holds polish well and the top coat dries incredibly quickly.</li>
            <li> So quick and easy! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great products! Will definitely order again. Made my nails really shiny :)</li>
            <li> As most reviewers had commented, the top coat is fabulous. The best. But will need to air my room after doing my nails. The base coat was average.</li>
            <li> This is the cheapest I&#x27;ve ever seen Seche Vite sold so I had to buy it for old times sake. It has a bit of a learning curve but I think I&#x27;ve got it down and I love it. I have a terrible time with chipped nails between bartending and typing at my full-time job, so to have a home manicure that doesn&#x27;t chip after a couple hours (let alone three days) is unreal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: It doesn&#x27;t work as well with certain color coats. I used it with Sally Hansen Xtreme Wear which usually has great durability without a topcoat and it peeled right off after day one. I am using it now with Essie, which has a terrible dry time without a top coat, and it is going strong.</li>
            <li> It is really Seche Vite!! I think there has to be knock offs out there. Who doesn&#x27;t want top shine and quick dry! Satisfied!!</li>
            <li> For the price, this base/top coat combo is a good deal. The base coat paints on a little thin and dries a little matte, which when I first used it was unsure of how well it was going to work, but it definitely helps the color adhere to the nail better. The top coat is awesome! It completely dries within a minute (and is nice and shiny) and lasts for days without chipping. I have a very hands on job and to be able to have a top coat that can withstand all the damage my hands take is amazing. I&#x27;ll admit, it&#x27;s not as durable as a gel manacure, but for the price it&#x27;s worth trying. There&#x27;s a reason Seche Vite is one of the top nail polish base/top coats out there on the market. The only negative thing I have to say is that the top coat has a very chemically smell when applying it, but the smell goes away once the polish dries.</li>
            <li> I read an online article recently about top 10 beauty products every girl should have and this Seche Vite fast dry top coat was listed as one of them. I&#x27;ve been living abroad for about 4 years now so I wasn&#x27;t too familiar with this brand and I&#x27;ve been doing my own nails for about 2 years now. I went on Amazon and read So Many positive reviews about this brand and how awesome it is! So many great reviews in fact that I thought I seriously had to try it for myself! First, I checked if this product was available in Seoul, South Korea and it was but for about 30-50 USD; but on Amazon a lot of sellers were pricing it at about 5 dollars a bottle! Such a deal, so I got the base coat and top coat duo for around 8 dollars plus shipping my total was less than 20 USD and it just arrived last night! Approximately 1.5 weeks later at standard international shipping--super fast!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-glides on easily and smoothly&lt;br /&gt;-base coat adheres to the nail polish color of your choice INSTANTLY and smoothly without any streaks or bubbles&lt;br /&gt;-top coat is thick and also goes on smoothly and evenly&lt;br /&gt;-ENTIRE NAIL IS DRY IN LESS THAN 5 MINUTES!! &lt;---Amazing! I usually do my nails at night and I have to wait at least an hour or so before attempting to go to bed and I&#x27;m always worried about sheet marks on my nails in the morning :( But with Seche Vite my nails were completely dry in seriously less than 5 minutes and SO SHINY and GLOSSY. I could even blow dry my hair and run my freshly painted nails through my hair right after!&lt;br /&gt;-Shiny, glossy, chip free nails (it&#x27;s only been a day, but my nails look so fresh and professionally done! Usually even by the second day they are already a bit dull looking and not as shiny or glossy as when I first applied the top coat).&lt;br /&gt;-Easily removable with nail polish remover! This is a huge pro for me because if I paint my nails a dark or bright color (ie: red, hot pink, etc) the color smears as it comes off with nail polish remover. It takes me numerous times and cotton pads to remove it all, and even then there&#x27;s a tint of the color left on my nail and surround skin. I always assumed this was bc some of my nail polishes weren&#x27;t expensive or \\&quot;nice\\&quot; ones, just the dollar nail polish in a pretty shade, but after using Seche Clear &amp; Seche Vite the color comes off in a clean single sweep (regardless of color) with no smearing or tinting. It&#x27;s clean, easy, and super fast! I now realized the base and top coat are really important and the quality of the nail polish color doesn&#x27;t matter as much. Definitely worth it to invest in a nicer base and top coat and have fun with less expensive nail polish colors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-Honestly, none really, I guess though you should be aware that the top coat has a really strong chemical smell when you apply it (but it goes away). Also, the base coat is more watery than I expected (I&#x27;m used to a thicker base coat consistency) but I think this helps the base coat act more like a bond/glue so your nail polish can adhere to your nail better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Seche Vite top coat and base coat has made an incredible impression on me. You will not be disappointed ladies, give it a try :)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff to death. The only thing is if ur bottom coats thick and isn&#x27;t dry when u put the top coat on you&#x27;ll still mess it up if you aren&#x27;t careful. But the set itself is great</li>
            <li> I love this product - it smells like furniture varnish - but it works!</li>
            <li> Great product!! Nails held their shine and the drying time is amazing... I&#x27;m definitely hooked!</li>
            <li> Best base and top coat around!</li>
            <li> Where have it been all my previous life??? It is not really healthy for nails (I mean this top coat) but I do not care. I love the shine and how long any nail color stays on the nails. Fabulous!</li>
            <li> I bought this to apply to my saint pendants &amp; religious medals on my necklace. Why? Cos I don&#x27;t like tarnished brass and nickle, which the medals are made of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had originally bought a dollar-store bottle of top-coat, and that stuff stayed sticky, and wore off pretty quick. It also sticks horribly of toluene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then searched for more professional nail lacquers. Spray lacquer is usually used on brass and such to keep from tarnishing. But, obviously using a spray on a small item like a pendant is a waste. So, nail polish lacquer seemed like a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seche is apparently what professional manicurists use and it was reportedly the strongest lacquer I could find. So I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good product, easy to apply, fast drying, and provides a good long-lasting hard coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint: The top coat dries out IN THE BOTTLE fairly quickly. So, then I&#x27;ll probably have to buy some Seche thinner. But, since I&#x27;m only using it on metals, I&#x27;ll probably use up the whole bottle of top coat the next time I use it, and hopefully avoid the need to use thinner. I put on 3 coats on each side of each medal, which used half the bottle. Only used a little of the base coat. I probably don&#x27;t need the base coat for this purpose.</li>
            <li> If you need a fast drying top coat--this is the one, you will not got wrong. It dries in seconds</li>
            <li> I was so excited to order this duo as I have heard nothing but good things about Seche Vite, the top coat. I thought that if I used Seche Clear along with Seche Vite, my at-home manicure would be fantastic. That was not the case. I put my layer of base coat on, followed by two coats of Essie nail polish, then finished with the top coat. The top coat dried so quickly, I was able to do anything after 5-10 minutes. It seemed to be a great duo at first since my nails were shiny and smooth. However, the next day, my nails started chipping right away. The previous week, I used a Sally Hansen base coat/top coat along with Essie nail polish and my nails were chip-free for a week. With Seche Clear as the base coat, my nail polish peeled off in one piece... overall, love Seche Vite, very disappointed with Seche Clear.</li>
            <li> The best, you won&#x27;t buy any other brand after using this.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while now and generally I am very pleased. The only issue I have with these bottles is that my bottle of top coat is only half gone, but I&#x27;m already finding it hard to get the brush to reach the product to get enough on the brush. Without screwing the top in, I will soon be unable to use the product and I can already see that I&#x27;m not going to be able to use the full bottle before having to order more. Otherwise, the product gives a great, smooth shine to my nails and the base works well to prevent staining.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what nail salons use and it is really expensive anywhere else. Follow the directions and it works like a charm. I do not use any other top coat but this.</li>
            <li> Seche the quick dry I use it between manacures</li>
            <li> i will never buy another top coat again !!  this product is amazing defiantly get the base and top coat</li>
            <li> The best base coat and top coat i ever had. I will order more</li>
            <li> This stuff dries really fast and is hard as a rock! I was really surprised at how fast it dried and I didn&#x27;t smug one nail, that never happens!</li>
            <li> great stuff. I received it today ,and only used top coat on my original polished nails--and it dried in seconds, literally, maybe 20 second--and it was totally dry..wow..I am impressed so far</li>
            <li> I made this purchase a while back but forgot to review it. Anyways, the bottle with the base coat came with no brush, how am I suppose to use it? So I never got to. Top coat is awesome though. That is all.</li>
            <li> As advertised!  My nails don&#x27;t get yellow and they dry in 20 minutes with two coats of color.  I have already bought the product for multiple friends!</li>
            <li> This is the best fast during top coat I&#x27;ve used. I love the Seche Vite top coat, so I decided to order both the base and top coat.  This product seemed like a good deal for both, so I ordered it.  The brush for the base coat came damaged, and sometimes makes using it a bit difficult.  I&#x27;ll like reorder just he top coat next time.</li>
            <li> Great product, excellent price. Shipping was lightening fast and product was packaged well.&lt;br /&gt;Seller was very responsive. You&#x27;ve made a new customer in me! Thank you and keep up the good work!</li>
            <li> Great base and top coat. The only reason why it did not get 5 stars is because the top coat seems a little thicker than it should be!</li>
            <li> Great product and quick service.</li>
            <li> This is amazing.Top coat make it quick dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rough on my nails with all the knitting, crafting, and other things I do. This top coat is perfect for me and withstands all the things I do. My nail colors last a very long time with this and I love it.</li>
            <li> The top and base coat are wonderful! I love the way my nails look now that I know how to do them</li>
            <li> I use to hate doing my nails at home because they would smudge before drying all the way and chip a day after applying, with this combo it doesn&#x27;t happen. It dries REALLY fast no matter how many coats you put on, and it last for days. The longest was about 6 days. Would definitely recommend if you don&#x27;t want to go out and get manicures every week.</li>
            <li> This is the best base coat and top coat I have ever tried. It goes on smoothly and dries quickly. I will definitely buy these again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. Provides really great shine and stay power!</li>
            <li> Received these really quick.  Love this top coat.</li>
            <li> So far the best top coat i have ever tried. I love it and deffinetly will buy it again!</li>
            <li> Indeed fast drying toppcoat.</li>
            <li> The base coat is perfect. It glides on smoothly and you can tell it helps the nail polish hold. The top coat might do its job too well though. I literally find myself racing to put on a smooth coat before it starts to dry. It honestly won&#x27;t be a perfect dry after only a few minutes but it definitely cuts down the dry time from two hours to maybe a little less than an hour which is still pretty great. I would definitely give the nail polish some time to dry on its own before applying the top coat because it started to take off some of the polish when I tried to go straight into it. Also, my friend had the top coat and left it open for a little too long and it got really goopy and gross so I would definitely keep the top coat tightly closed whenever you do not need it.</li>
            <li> Dries within 45 seconds ! I absolutely love the shine it leaves on my nail and it does not start chipping until after a week!;)</li>
            <li> Love love love!! I never paint my own nails because typically after I finish the top coat I can&#x27;t do anything for 2 hours and they would still probably smudge. This base coat allows the nail polish to go on and stay on for several days without chipping and the top coat dried quickly and made the nails looks great. Would recommend to anyone!</li>
