            <li>and she does a better job on her own nails than the salon.</li>
            <li>I was told by a professional manicure CND is the best.</li>
            <li>but it is easy too!</li>
            <li>Good luck and have fun!</li>
            <li>and although I didn&#x27;t do a great job it was my first time and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very important that no edges are exposed anywhere or the Shellac starts to lift.    </li>
            <li>easy to do your own nails that way ))</li>
            <li>I got this for my college-aged daughter who is a huge nail painter and she LOVES it!  </li>
            <li>I would like to see more polish remover offered though.</li>
            <li>Everything you need and more</li>
            <li>By doing it myself along with the company&#x27;s YouTube instruction video I learn the appropriate way to apply.  </li>
            <li>It helps anyone who want to get in to the Gel or Shellac business, by doing so you have more variaty for your business.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Only wish they had more colors, for instance orange, coral, etc.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully, I will learn more as I go along.</li>
            <li>Mostly peel of my polish.</li>
            <li>I love the shellac kit.</li>
            <li>, I think I just need more practice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve watched so many tutorials on YouTube and googled tips and tricks.  </li>
            <li>The kit comes with everything you will need to get started (except the uv light)!</li>
            <li>Love the kit,&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>and you have everything you need to obtain the same wonderful results as a salon manicure!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>I have been enjoying seeing</li>
            <li>The others I mentions before like regal nails, it last perfect 10 days to 2 weeks, but it destroys the nails with the time.</li>
            <li>I love that you don&#x27;t have to scuff up the nail like they do in the salon....  </li>
            <li>Not so sure how the removal pads will work (( My nail salon just used cotton and foil to wrap the tips ))</li>
            <li>While I can tell that I did my nail (still perfecting applyng polish), many people have asked me if I went and got my nails done.</li>
            <li>This product is top shelf.</li>
            <li>truly makes my  job easier we all love it in our nail salon</li>
            <li>I do love this kit...</li>
            <li>I read the on-line MSDS for their Scrub-Fresh and just mix my own 50-50 mix of 99% isopropyl alcohol and 100% acetone (1/2 capful each) with one drop of essential orange oil (the additional solvent they use) and follow their instructions to a T, including shaking each and every bottle for a full 30 seconds before use (you need to get those solvents in their patented formula to mix perfectly or it doesn&#x27;t apply/cure correctly!)    </li>
            <li>Packaging was good and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>so gel is much nicer for me to have, longevity wise.</li>
            <li>Using the pads to soak of it dosen&#x27;t come off easy or in 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>It chipped easily and peeled in a week.</li>
            <li>but we will see if it comes off easily..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use and to work with it</li>
            <li>The light seemed to work fine</li>
            <li>I wish they sold a curing light as well, but you do have to buy that separate.</li>
            <li>This is a great kit and will last forever.</li>
            <li>Add the CND UV light</li>
            <li>I bought this product b/c it claimed to be chip free for two weeks.</li>
            <li>THIS (you have to buy the salon light seperate</li>
            <li>I bought this product about 6 weeks ago along with a UV light.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product and a UV light (not CND&#x27;s) and have done my nails twice.  </li>
            <li>I really am happy that I bought the entire system!!!</li>
            <li>I also purchased the uv gel light for $52.00.</li>
            <li>After wearing Shellac for 4 weeks my nails are beautiful and long.</li>
            <li>Love love live this starter kit.  </li>
            <li>I did get a lamp too and it is all well worth it for me!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think is worth it!  </li>
            <li>So, I will save money in the long run and have great nails along the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>So worth it!  </li>
            <li>Cool because it fits both hands in at one time...  </li>
            <li>I have given myself about 3 Shellac manicures so far, and I do it just as nice as the pros.  </li>
            <li>They worked with us to get it shipped quickly</li>
            <li>she had never used this product before and quickly learned.  </li>
            <li>quick to apply.</li>
            <li>I look forward to seeing more colors selections available in the future.</li>
            <li>be sure to buy a uv light to go with it as well, i went with a thermal spa double model</li>
            <li>I also purchased lint-free pads for the last polishing step and use them with my own foil for removal.</li>
            <li>definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>but it broke right after we bought it.</li>
            <li>This stuff lasts about a week on me, and when it is time to take it off, it peels right off.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s done her nails two or three times now and the shellac polish is giving her right at about two weeks of wear</li>
            <li>I was so impressed with the long lasting effect and not to mention the lack of touch ups and filing I would normally have to do.</li>
            <li>But for less than $200, I&#x27;ve invested in the full Shellac system, with colors and lamp, and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>The product is easy to put on and looks professional when done.</li>
            <li>CND has a great tutorial on their website to help you out with your french manicure as well, so if you are like me and nervous google and watch just prior.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly happy with the colors included, I purchased a new color to get a duo look with the fedora color, otherwise I feel it&#x27;s too dark for my tastes, and now feel happier with the color selection.</li>
            <li>And I love their french manicure technique of just painting the top half of my nail vertically with one of their whites, then dipping a french manicure brush in the alcohol and just dissolve the white away into a perfect smile line instead of having to apply a thick line of white polish side-to-side in a ridge, hopefully in a perfect curved line.  </li>
            <li>I do know others that it does last almost 3 weeks for they were blessed with a better set of nails.  </li>
            <li>My wife received this as a Christmas present, and so far she is very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>More than enough supplies to get started.</li>
            <li>(( I also purchased the ROYAL NAILS PROFESSIONAL UV LIGHT..</li>
            <li>This takes me a bit more time then the salon, but only every two weeks!  </li>
            <li>I did a french pedicure and love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It went on very easy and dried quickly under the UV Lamp</li>
            <li>Pure acetone drys out your nails and so breakage occurs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with what I received but extremely unhappy that it didn&#x27;t contain the uv light.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy this product it goes on well and lasts all week, probably would last longer</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very hopeful though</li>
            <li>and it really stays on for weeks.</li>
            <li>but the red kept running and tainted the duo color even after placing it under the UV light....</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to worry so much about it growing out.</li>
            <li>After placing the order, I e-mailed Pros Salon Supply to make sure it was in stock (they only showed 1 remaining) and asked if they could possibly expedite the order in the hopes we would receive it in time.  </li>
            <li>The final result is super shiny.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend Shellac to anyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;I bought it after taking gels off.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, this system really does shine, it stiffens my nails and allows them to grow without peeling and snapping off like they do naturally</li>
            <li>I will update in a few months after I have gotten better at applying the ponish and on the wear and tear of the polish.</li>
            <li>After getting this kit I braved french manicure at home (why not since the colors are included right?)</li>
            <li>The colors that come with it are Fedora which is a very dark but pretty color, a very nice red, and 2 different whites for doing French manicures.  </li>
            <li>Can mix the 4 colors to make new ones by looking on Cnd site gives you mix instruction.</li>
            <li>purchased the new CND Summer  2013 Collection and the Romatique colors</li>
            <li>other then that Love all the products that come with the kit especially since&lt;br /&gt;there is alittle booklet that gives tips and the steps to use them correctly.</li>
            <li>Such a simple and clean look</li>
            <li>It is dry immediatley after applying the top coat and 90 sec.</li>
            <li>I read claims about your nails weakening from shellac but the only reason I can see this happening is from using pure acetone on your nails.  </li>
            <li>That should be made clear in the description.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gives my nails a professional manicure and polish every time/</li>
            <li>Only problem I had was if I used too much of the polish.</li>
            <li>only reason Im not giving 5 starts is because the removers tend to absorb waaaay to much of the acetone and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a busy working mom and didn&#x27;t have time to keep my nails done.</li>
            <li>So far my nails have held up to a busy Thanksgiving weekend..</li>
            <li>...Can&#x27;t wait to play with nail art on my 13 year old daughter and her friends fingers and toes.  </li>
            <li>I wish they had included a cuticle softener as well, but it&#x27;s a really complete kit even without.</li>
            <li>It was much easier to do than I had expected.</li>
            <li>Needless to say I bought this starter set and am doing my own nails at home.</li>
            <li>After reading over the information I tried to apply a little thinner coat each time and also tried to stay away from the cuticles a little better.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunatily my nails are weak and they easily split which deters me from spending hours on polishing them only to have the polish flake off within 2 days.  </li>
            <li>This is a must have as you get a little bit of everything to start, oh and that red polish is absolutely gorgeous!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>

            <li> Using the pads to soak of it dosen&#x27;t come off easy or in 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> It chipped easily and peeled in a week.</li>
            <li> but we will see if it comes off easily..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use and to work with it</li>
            <li> The light seemed to work fine</li>
            <li> I wish they sold a curing light as well, but you do have to buy that separate.</li>
            <li> This is a great kit and will last forever.</li>
            <li> Add the CND UV light</li>
            <li> I bought this product b/c it claimed to be chip free for two weeks.</li>
            <li> THIS (you have to buy the salon light seperate</li>
            <li> I bought this product about 6 weeks ago along with a UV light.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and a UV light (not CND&#x27;s) and have done my nails twice.  </li>
            <li> I really am happy that I bought the entire system!!!</li>
            <li> I also purchased the uv gel light for $52.00.</li>
            <li> After wearing Shellac for 4 weeks my nails are beautiful and long.</li>
            <li> Love love live this starter kit.  </li>
            <li> I did get a lamp too and it is all well worth it for me!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think is worth it!  </li>
            <li> So, I will save money in the long run and have great nails along the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> So worth it!  </li>
            <li> Cool because it fits both hands in at one time...  </li>
            <li> I have given myself about 3 Shellac manicures so far, and I do it just as nice as the pros.  </li>
            <li> They worked with us to get it shipped quickly</li>
            <li> she had never used this product before and quickly learned.  </li>
            <li> quick to apply.</li>
            <li> I look forward to seeing more colors selections available in the future.</li>
            <li> be sure to buy a uv light to go with it as well, i went with a thermal spa double model</li>
            <li> I also purchased lint-free pads for the last polishing step and use them with my own foil for removal.</li>
            <li> definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> but it broke right after we bought it.</li>
            <li> This stuff lasts about a week on me, and when it is time to take it off, it peels right off.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s done her nails two or three times now and the shellac polish is giving her right at about two weeks of wear</li>
            <li> I was so impressed with the long lasting effect and not to mention the lack of touch ups and filing I would normally have to do.</li>
            <li> But for less than $200, I&#x27;ve invested in the full Shellac system, with colors and lamp, and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> The product is easy to put on and looks professional when done.</li>
            <li> CND has a great tutorial on their website to help you out with your french manicure as well, so if you are like me and nervous google and watch just prior.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly happy with the colors included, I purchased a new color to get a duo look with the fedora color, otherwise I feel it&#x27;s too dark for my tastes, and now feel happier with the color selection.</li>
            <li> And I love their french manicure technique of just painting the top half of my nail vertically with one of their whites, then dipping a french manicure brush in the alcohol and just dissolve the white away into a perfect smile line instead of having to apply a thick line of white polish side-to-side in a ridge, hopefully in a perfect curved line.  </li>
            <li> I do know others that it does last almost 3 weeks for they were blessed with a better set of nails.  </li>
            <li> My wife received this as a Christmas present, and so far she is very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> More than enough supplies to get started.</li>
            <li> (( I also purchased the ROYAL NAILS PROFESSIONAL UV LIGHT..</li>
            <li> This takes me a bit more time then the salon, but only every two weeks!  </li>
            <li> I did a french pedicure and love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It went on very easy and dried quickly under the UV Lamp</li>
            <li> Pure acetone drys out your nails and so breakage occurs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with what I received but extremely unhappy that it didn&#x27;t contain the uv light.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy this product it goes on well and lasts all week, probably would last longer</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very hopeful though</li>
            <li> and it really stays on for weeks.</li>
            <li> but the red kept running and tainted the duo color even after placing it under the UV light....</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to worry so much about it growing out.</li>
            <li> After placing the order, I e-mailed Pros Salon Supply to make sure it was in stock (they only showed 1 remaining) and asked if they could possibly expedite the order in the hopes we would receive it in time.  </li>
            <li> The final result is super shiny.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend Shellac to anyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;I bought it after taking gels off.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, this system really does shine, it stiffens my nails and allows them to grow without peeling and snapping off like they do naturally</li>
            <li> I will update in a few months after I have gotten better at applying the ponish and on the wear and tear of the polish.</li>
            <li> After getting this kit I braved french manicure at home (why not since the colors are included right?)</li>
            <li> The colors that come with it are Fedora which is a very dark but pretty color, a very nice red, and 2 different whites for doing French manicures.  </li>
            <li> Can mix the 4 colors to make new ones by looking on Cnd site gives you mix instruction.</li>
            <li> purchased the new CND Summer  2013 Collection and the Romatique colors</li>
            <li> other then that Love all the products that come with the kit especially since&lt;br /&gt;there is alittle booklet that gives tips and the steps to use them correctly.</li>
            <li> Such a simple and clean look</li>
            <li> It is dry immediatley after applying the top coat and 90 sec.</li>
            <li> I read claims about your nails weakening from shellac but the only reason I can see this happening is from using pure acetone on your nails.  </li>
            <li> That should be made clear in the description.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gives my nails a professional manicure and polish every time/</li>
            <li> Only problem I had was if I used too much of the polish.</li>
            <li> only reason Im not giving 5 starts is because the removers tend to absorb waaaay to much of the acetone and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a busy working mom and didn&#x27;t have time to keep my nails done.</li>
            <li> So far my nails have held up to a busy Thanksgiving weekend..</li>
            <li> ...Can&#x27;t wait to play with nail art on my 13 year old daughter and her friends fingers and toes.  </li>
            <li> I wish they had included a cuticle softener as well, but it&#x27;s a really complete kit even without.</li>
            <li> It was much easier to do than I had expected.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I bought this starter set and am doing my own nails at home.</li>
            <li> After reading over the information I tried to apply a little thinner coat each time and also tried to stay away from the cuticles a little better.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunatily my nails are weak and they easily split which deters me from spending hours on polishing them only to have the polish flake off within 2 days.  </li>
            <li> This is a must have as you get a little bit of everything to start, oh and that red polish is absolutely gorgeous!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> under the light you don&#x27;t have to worry about smearing or marks on your nails they are dry, hard and shiny!</li>
            <li> I like doing my own nails as it of course less expensive after the initial outlay</li>
            <li> The AC plug in the back came loose.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made and expensive.</li>
            <li> It comes with red, dark burgundy and french nail polish.</li>
            <li> only down fall is</li>
            <li> Anyway, it fits into my lifestyle of housecleaning, laundry, gardening, setting up/taking down banners and apparel boxes/tables for booster clubs and just overall busy/hard on my hands</li>
            <li> in my opinion I don&#x27;t think that is necessary because you can remove it with less acetone...</li>
            <li> I do not wear red or black polish</li>
            <li> but it last less time, just one week.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that they say it will last 2</li>
            <li> (one is transparent and has undertones of pink and the other is opaque)  </li>
            <li> I will need to practice a little the polish goes on a little different than what I am used to using.</li>
            <li> It goes on just like regular polish, drys in a few minutes under a UV lamp, lasts two weeks and comes off in as little as 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> and I am very careful in how I do my prep manicure after removing the Shellac.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> All other nailpolish would chip after a few days.</li>
            <li> weeks, when it is half the time on me.</li>
            <li> I agree that it causes less damage to the nails</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only in my life ever had a manicure once - too expensive for just a couple of days&#x27; beauty, but my regular polishes were always chipped in a day</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;ll keep or return due to money I spent and no light.</li>
            <li> I am very hard on nail polish, it only lasts me a day or two, max.</li>
            <li> Pro: no longer feel I have wasted my money on shellac.  </li>
            <li> Only need really thin coats or it will bubble when under the heat lamp</li>
            <li> I have yet to see a natural look with fake nails and chose a manicure with gel polish.  </li>
            <li> They did start to peel off a few days before the 2 week mark.  </li>
            <li> no need to waste, anyways, those nail polish removers are an optional thing.</li>
            <li> so those will go to waste....</li>
            <li> I have also done my daughters, and a few friends.</li>
            <li> Pricy for the small quantity.</li>
            <li> No more chipping or soaking in acetone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually used to get my nails done at Regal nails or a OPI manicure place</li>
            <li> not sure why</li>
            <li> I work in retail and always killed my polish,but NO MORE!  </li>
            <li> Common mistake salons use</li>
            <li> I also was not kind to my nails because of doing gardening etc.  </li>
            <li> And you do not have to buy the wraps to remove polish when the ones in this set are gone - it is much less expensive to use aluminum foil cut in to 2 inch squares and then use 1/2 cotton ball soaked in acetone.</li>
            <li> My tips aren&#x27;t thick at all!    </li>
            <li> With CND, my nail polish I can make it almost 2 weeks with this product (but I am very hard on my nails).  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want fake nails for they look thick and like paddles.  </li>
            <li> I was tired of paying for salons.</li>
            <li> com/2010/05/how-to-do-your-own-professional dot html (except the ending polish step) and [...]    I can attest that cuticle remover (not their Solaroil) is an absolute - they just looked horrible without it and all the polish started peeling from the sides.</li>
            <li> hours before applying new polish (that acetone is horrible for our nails!)    </li>
            <li> but it gets expensive and it takes time I don&#x27;t have</li>
            <li> Way toooooo expensive and over priced.  </li>
            <li> so I hated them and hardly ever polished my nails.</li>
            <li> But then I am bad with polish.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This system is wonderful.  It&#x27;s gives my nails a professional manicure and polish every time/</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Pricy for the small quantity. I would like to see more polish remover offered though.</li>
            <li> The AC plug in the back came loose. Cheaply made and expensive. The light seemed to work fine but it broke right after we bought it.</li>
            <li> Everything you need and more</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product it goes on well and lasts all week, probably would last longer but I&#x27;m constantly washing my hands and cleaning.</li>
            <li> Pro: no longer feel I have wasted my money on shellac.  I could not find a nail salon that could apply shellac and it last longer than 4-5 days before peeling. I&#x27;m was beginning to feel like it does not work.  By doing it myself along with the company&#x27;s YouTube instruction video I learn the appropriate way to apply.  Common mistake salons use Is they try to stretch polishing by using thinner, this is one reason why it does not last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: I would have like to seek a bigger bottle of acetone considering the number of nail sleeves included in the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love love live this starter kit.  I was paying $40 every two weeks at a salon to have my nails done.  Don&#x27;t really care for the remover pads the don&#x27;t stay on real good but I use them and wrap in foil. Only problem I had was if I used too much of the polish. Only need really thin coats or it will bubble when under the heat lamp</li>
            <li> I love it! I can go several weeks without chipping!</li>
            <li> very easy to use, I&#x27;ve saved a lot of money doing my nails my self.</li>
            <li> I received a gift certificate to a nail salon.  I didn&#x27;t want fake nails for they look thick and like paddles.  I have yet to see a natural look with fake nails and chose a manicure with gel polish.  Unfortunatily my nails are weak and they easily split which deters me from spending hours on polishing them only to have the polish flake off within 2 days.  With CND, my nail polish I can make it almost 2 weeks with this product (but I am very hard on my nails).  I find this extremely impressive!!!!  I do know others that it does last almost 3 weeks for they were blessed with a better set of nails.  I look forward to seeing more colors selections available in the future.</li>
            <li> Great starter kit! It helps anyone who want to get in to the Gel or Shellac business, by doing so you have more variaty for your business. Which means more clients!!</li>
            <li> I was tired of paying for salons. I watched how it was done 4 times at 4 different salons. Then ordered this kit. I love it! I like doing my own nails as it of course less expensive after the initial outlay but it is easy too! Just follow the instructions. And you do not have to buy the wraps to remove polish when the ones in this set are gone - it is much less expensive to use aluminum foil cut in to 2 inch squares and then use 1/2 cotton ball soaked in acetone. But this kit is a great start for the money! I did get a lamp too and it is all well worth it for me!</li>
            <li> This is good stuff! I wish they sold a curing light as well, but you do have to buy that separate. I am very hard on nail polish, it only lasts me a day or two, max. This stuff lasts about a week on me, and when it is time to take it off, it peels right off. No more chipping or soaking in acetone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that they say it will last 2+ weeks, when it is half the time on me. But then I am bad with polish. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before making this purchase.  Shellac versus gel and shellac is definitely the way to go for me.  It goes on just like regular polish, drys in a few minutes under a UV lamp, lasts two weeks and comes off in as little as 10 minutes. I read claims about your nails weakening from shellac but the only reason I can see this happening is from using pure acetone on your nails.  Pure acetone drys out your nails and so breakage occurs. As I will always redo my nails once I remove the polish I don&#x27;t see a problem. Hopefully I&#x27;m right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only wish they had more colors, for instance orange, coral, etc.  they should take a cue from Essie.</li>
            <li> I quit doing acrylic because of the abuse it was doing to my nails.  So after waiting for my nails to heal I put the shellac on my short nails.  It was very easy and looked really nice.  They did start to peel off a few days before the 2 week mark.  I just finished doing my nails the second time.  After reading over the information I tried to apply a little thinner coat each time and also tried to stay away from the cuticles a little better.  I also was not kind to my nails because of doing gardening etc.  Hopefully, I will learn more as I go along.</li>
            <li> This is a great kit and will last forever. Can mix the 4 colors to make new ones by looking on Cnd site gives you mix instruction. Mostly peel of my polish. Using the pads to soak of it dosen&#x27;t come off easy or in 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> This set is amazing. It comes with everything you need to start your shellac manicures in the comfort of your home. The product was as described. Packaging was good and fast shipping. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My wife received this as a Christmas present, and so far she is very pleased with it.  The nature of the review is to praise the service of the seller, Pros Salon Supply.  When my son and I found out she was wanting this, we placed the order even though it stated it probably would not arrive by Christmas.  After placing the order, I e-mailed Pros Salon Supply to make sure it was in stock (they only showed 1 remaining) and asked if they could possibly expedite the order in the hopes we would receive it in time.  They worked with us to get it shipped quickly and it arrived on Christmas eve.  They are a credit to good salesmanship and customer service we will not hesitate to purchase from them again.</li>
            <li> bought for wife as a xmas gift. she loves it. be sure to buy a uv light to go with it as well, i went with a thermal spa double model</li>
            <li> This is a must have as you get a little bit of everything to start, oh and that red polish is absolutely gorgeous!&lt;br /&gt;The only reason Im not giving 5 starts is because the removers tend to absorb waaaay to much of the acetone and in my opinion I don&#x27;t think that is necessary because you can remove it with less acetone... no need to waste, anyways, those nail polish removers are an optional thing.</li>
            <li> I love the shellac kit. I can&#x27;t get my nails to last for two weeks. I get about 1. And if I do someone else&#x27;s nails they only last for about 3 days. I&#x27;m very hopeful though, I think I just need more practice. I&#x27;ve watched so many tutorials on YouTube and googled tips and tricks.  Hopefully I get the hang of it! The kit comes with everything you will need to get started (except the uv light)!</li>
            <li> Love the kit,&lt;br /&gt;The only down fall is I do not wear red or black polish so those will go to waste....&lt;br /&gt;But other then that Love all the products that come with the kit especially since&lt;br /&gt;there is alittle booklet that gives tips and the steps to use them correctly.</li>
            <li> The durability of the polish was not up to expectations. It chipped easily and peeled in a week. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I get tons of compliments at work and asked where I get my nails done. There are tons of YouTube videos to explain how to do the application and fix any mistakes.</li>
            <li> YES!  I can do my own manicure, and wear protective uv hand gloves!</li>
            <li> I love it! Great Intro Pack!</li>
            <li> CND Shellac is wonderful!!  This package has everything you need from start to finish product wise.  Add the CND UV light and you have everything you need to obtain the same wonderful results as a salon manicure!</li>
            <li> I bought this product b/c it claimed to be chip free for two weeks. All other nailpolish would chip after a few days. I&#x27;m a busy working mom and didn&#x27;t have time to keep my nails done. Let alone go to the salon. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT it&#x27;s amazing. You apply the products about 20-30 min and it really stays on for weeks. It is dry immediatley after applying the top coat and 90 sec. under the light you don&#x27;t have to worry about smearing or marks on your nails they are dry, hard and shiny! LOVE THIS (you have to buy the salon light seperate it does not come with the kit, I found one for $40)</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift, and she loves it.</li>
            <li> This product is terrific. I had acrylic nails for 14 years and it ruined my own nails. This product is easy to apply and my nails look beautiful without damaging them. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about 6 weeks ago along with a UV light. It was much easier to do than I had expected. It comes with red, dark burgundy and french nail polish. I like the fact I can give myself a manicure that lasts up to 2 weeks without spending both time and money in a salon. The product is easy to put on and looks professional when done. I figure it has already almost paid for itself. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Bought this kit for my wife and she loves it!! She&#x27;s done her nails two or three times now and the shellac polish is giving her right at about two weeks of wear and she does a better job on her own nails than the salon. I love it because it will save me a ton of money now that she doesn&#x27;t have to get her nails done twice a month!! That was $30 a pop!!</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my gf! she had never used this product before and quickly learned.  I got her the UV lamp and extra colors to go with it.  I have been enjoying seeing have her nails done for almost two weeks.  Before with regular nail polish she would only keep it for about 2 days and then remove it because it had chipped off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend Shellac to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with what I received but extremely unhappy that it didn&#x27;t contain the uv light.  That should be made clear in the description.  Not sure if I&#x27;ll keep or return due to money I spent and no light.I did receive the product promptly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product! easy to use and great results. quick to apply. I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it! More than enough supplies to get started. Highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;I bought it after taking gels off.  My nails were brittle and breaking.  After wearing Shellac for 4 weeks my nails are beautiful and long.</li>
            <li> I usually used to get my nails done at Regal nails or a OPI manicure place but it gets expensive and it takes time I don&#x27;t have, so I got this set. I was told by a professional manicure CND is the best. Well it is NOT the best at all. I agree that it causes less damage to the nails but it last less time, just one week. The others I mentions before like regal nails, it last perfect 10 days to 2 weeks, but it destroys the nails with the time.</li>
            <li> I just got this last week..  I have done my nails and my Mom&#x27;s nails...  I love that you don&#x27;t have to scuff up the nail like they do in the salon....  So far my nails have held up to a busy Thanksgiving weekend.. and they still look great.&lt;br /&gt;It went on very easy and dried quickly under the UV Lamp (( I also purchased the ROYAL NAILS PROFESSIONAL UV LIGHT.. Cool because it fits both hands in at one time...  easy to do your own nails that way ))&lt;br /&gt;Now I have not taken the polish off yet.. Not so sure how the removal pads will work (( My nail salon just used cotton and foil to wrap the tips )) but we will see if it comes off easily..&lt;br /&gt;I hope I can continue to keep my nails looking nice without having to spend the time and the money at the nail salon.</li>
            <li> While I can tell that I did my nail (still perfecting applyng polish), many people have asked me if I went and got my nails done. The final result is super shiny. I will update in a few months after I have gotten better at applying the ponish and on the wear and tear of the polish.</li>
            <li> I got this for my college-aged daughter who is a huge nail painter and she LOVES it!  It arrrived very quickly, contained everything that said it would and works wonderfully!  :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only in my life ever had a manicure once - too expensive for just a couple of days&#x27; beauty, but my regular polishes were always chipped in a day so I hated them and hardly ever polished my nails. But for less than $200, I&#x27;ve invested in the full Shellac system, with colors and lamp, and absolutely love it! I read the on-line MSDS for their Scrub-Fresh and just mix my own 50-50 mix of 99% isopropyl alcohol and 100% acetone (1/2 capful each) with one drop of essential orange oil (the additional solvent they use) and follow their instructions to a T, including shaking each and every bottle for a full 30 seconds before use (you need to get those solvents in their patented formula to mix perfectly or it doesn&#x27;t apply/cure correctly!)    I also purchased lint-free pads for the last polishing step and use them with my own foil for removal. Anything to save money. However, I can&#x27;t find any substitute for their Solaroil - it&#x27;s ultra-fine to absorb into their honey-combed polish and reach our nails so I just bought a big bottle to save money. Anyway, this system really does shine, it stiffens my nails and allows them to grow without peeling and snapping off like they do naturally and I am very careful in how I do my prep manicure after removing the Shellac.  I oil &amp; lotion them well for a couple hours before applying new polish (that acetone is horrible for our nails!)    And I love their french manicure technique of just painting the top half of my nail vertically with one of their whites, then dipping a french manicure brush in the alcohol and just dissolve the white away into a perfect smile line instead of having to apply a thick line of white polish side-to-side in a ridge, hopefully in a perfect curved line.  My tips aren&#x27;t thick at all!    If you can just afford salon nails and don&#x27;t want to bother, I envy you. But otherwise give it a chance. Here are the instructions I use: nailbabble dot blogspot dot com/2010/05/how-to-do-your-own-professional dot html (except the ending polish step) and [...]    I can attest that cuticle remover (not their Solaroil) is an absolute - they just looked horrible without it and all the polish started peeling from the sides. It&#x27;s very important that no edges are exposed anywhere or the Shellac starts to lift.    Anyway, it fits into my lifestyle of housecleaning, laundry, gardening, setting up/taking down banners and apparel boxes/tables for booster clubs and just overall busy/hard on my hands and I never wear gloves. And it pays for itself in just 4-5 applications. And no, I&#x27;m not a spokesperson. Good luck and have fun!</li>
            <li> This product is top shelf. It&#x27;s so easy to use and to work with it truly makes my  job easier we all love it in our nail salon the colors are very nice thank you.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think is worth it!  Way toooooo expensive and over priced.  It would be nice to have a packing slip and even the UV THING.</li>
            <li> I was spending between $25 and $35 every two weeks to have my nails done with CND Shellac.  I purchased this product and a UV light (not CND&#x27;s) and have done my nails twice.  They look great.  I have also done my daughters, and a few friends. This takes me a bit more time then the salon, but only every two weeks!  So, I will save money in the long run and have great nails along the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just purchased the new CND Summer  2013 Collection and the Romatique colors...Can&#x27;t wait to play with nail art on my 13 year old daughter and her friends fingers and toes.  Everyone will look great at the pool this summer!</li>
            <li> I do love this kit... but the red kept running and tainted the duo color even after placing it under the UV light.... not sure why and it could be user error. Either way it didn&#x27;t dent or chip afterwards so the quality is definitely there. We don&#x27;t have a dishwasher so gel is much nicer for me to have, longevity wise. After getting this kit I braved french manicure at home (why not since the colors are included right?) and although I didn&#x27;t do a great job it was my first time and definitely worth it. I did a french pedicure and love it. Such a simple and clean look and I don&#x27;t have to worry so much about it growing out. I&#x27;m fairly happy with the colors included, I purchased a new color to get a duo look with the fedora color, otherwise I feel it&#x27;s too dark for my tastes, and now feel happier with the color selection. If you are just getting in to doing gel manicures at home this is really a great way to go. I wish they had included a cuticle softener as well, but it&#x27;s a really complete kit even without. CND has a great tutorial on their website to help you out with your french manicure as well, so if you are like me and nervous google and watch just prior. I&#x27;ve done some touch ups to my pedicure and after the french manicure I used the red polish included along with a second CND color (cinnamon I think?) to create a 49ers inspired manicure. My husband really liked it and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the polish.</li>
            <li> I had been going to a nail salon to have Shellac French manicures and although she did a wonderful job, I just couldn&#x27;t afford the hefty price tag that came for the service.  After months of giving myself regular nail polish manicures and having them only last 2 or 3 days, I decided to check amazon and see what was offered.  I was thrilled when I found this!!!  I have given myself about 3 Shellac manicures so far, and I do it just as nice as the pros.  I love having the convenience of doing my nails whenever I want to without leaving my house!  I still am amazed that this manicure lasts 2+ weeks.  The colors that come with it are Fedora which is a very dark but pretty color, a very nice red, and 2 different whites for doing French manicures.  (one is transparent and has undertones of pink and the other is opaque)  I also bought the CND ultra violet lamp.  I really am happy that I bought the entire system!!!</li>
            <li> I recently had my nails with the shellac system and paid  $40.00 for it.  I was so impressed with the long lasting effect and not to mention the lack of touch ups and filing I would normally have to do. When I removed the polish myself I couldn&#x27;t believe how beautiful my nails looked. Needless to say I bought this starter set and am doing my own nails at home. I also purchased the uv gel light for $52.00. Ladies all I have to say is it has already paid itself off. I work in retail and always killed my polish,but NO MORE!  So worth it!  My only downside to this starter set is the colors they come with,really not for me! Hope this helps anyone debating on this purchase.</li>
            <li> I will need to practice a little the polish goes on a little different than what I am used to using. I polished my toes 2 weeks ago it is still looking great</li>
