    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The length was perfect.</li>
            <li>This mannequin head was perfect for that style.  </li>
            <li>What an wonderful length to work with!  </li>
            <li>The look on her face when she pulled a head out of a box was priceless..</li>
            <li>Worked perfectly for what I needed</li>
            <li>Was for a Christmas gift great</li>
            <li>I am happy I discovered this synthetic hair mannequin.  </li>
            <li>I love the best</li>
            <li>is that the length was absolutely perfect:  18 inches, I was able to install 18+ inches of loc extensions.  </li>
            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>THAT I COULD PRACTICE TO PUT IN MY OWN BOX BRAIDS.  </li>
            <li>Mannequin is nice, but it losses a lot of hair when you comb or brush it.</li>
            <li>Could have more hair.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this mannequin head.  </li>
            <li>This head of hair should have been better than what it was.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this to anyone thinking of becoming a cosmetologist.</li>
            <li>I suppose to enjoy this if its just going to shed everywhere</li>
            <li>The price of $14.99 was so fantastic, I had to buy two.  </li>
            <li>hair gets very frizzy, very easily</li>
            <li>but once I explained what it was to her, she wanted to play with it right away!</li>
            <li>A lot of bold spots</li>
            <li>Yet, with this synthetic hair all the strands were the same length making the end results look fabulous and more realistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first purchased this mannequin head to practice installing loc extensions, however one of my clients wanted cornrows with extensions.  </li>
            <li>and that makes it difficult to perfect a style like Sisterlocks, without strands sticking out.  </li>
            <li>The first day, mass amounts of hair shed.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I gently combed out the ends and used a paddle brush to brush the (synthetic) hair to a point that I would make it workable enough for me to be able to install loc extensions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The mannequin hair sheds extremely a lot and gets tangled very easily.</li>
            <li>The hair on this thing really sucked.</li>
            <li>But other then that it is ok.</li>
            <li>speaking of realistic, when I removed the cornrows out, the ends became frizzy.</li>
            <li>As mentioned I ordered a second mannequin head because the price was right.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it for my 8&amp;5 year old to play with.</li>
            <li>I purchased this as a Christmas present for my 19 yr old to practice her styling and braiding techniques.</li>
            <li>And, I would not be surprised if I were to buy another one, provided that it was priced the same.</li>
            <li>At first we thought it would was just slight because had been packaged but never stopped.</li>

            <li> I purchased this as a Christmas present for my 19 yr old to practice her styling and braiding techniques. The length was perfect. However, once she started to comb it and try to style it, the hair started to get nappy. Then two days later while trying to style it, the hair burned from the flat iron (on it&#x27;s lowest setting).</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected.. our quality though. Good thing I purchased it for my 8&amp;5 year old to play with.</li>
            <li> Was for a Christmas gift great</li>
            <li> The hair on this thing really sucked. It was shedding when it came out the box. At first we thought it would was just slight because had been packaged but never stopped. Couldn&#x27;t even use a flat iron on lowest setting for 5 seconds without burning hair off. I would not recommend this to anyone thinking of becoming a cosmetologist. You&#x27;ll flunk all your classes.</li>
            <li> the hair is so nappy when you comb it it tangles up easily not happy with this product</li>
            <li> The peoduct is horrible, bas quality.</li>
            <li> This mannequin is horrible. I just took it out the box to try it out. And the hair is just shedding everywhere. How am.I suppose to enjoy this if its just going to shed everywhere</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy terribe hair !!!!</li>
            <li> Could have more hair. A lot of bold spots</li>
            <li> Hair sheds everywhere</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mannequin head.  The price of $14.99 was so fantastic, I had to buy two.  I first purchased this mannequin head to practice installing loc extensions, however one of my clients wanted cornrows with extensions.  This mannequin head was perfect for that style.  All the hair is the same length, with human head mannequins I find that not all the hair is the same length and that makes it difficult to perfect a style like Sisterlocks, without strands sticking out.  Yet, with this synthetic hair all the strands were the same length making the end results look fabulous and more realistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now speaking of realistic, when I removed the cornrows out, the ends became frizzy. This is typical of synthetic hair.  Therefore, I gently combed out the ends and used a paddle brush to brush the (synthetic) hair to a point that I would make it workable enough for me to be able to install loc extensions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love the best is that the length was absolutely perfect:  18 inches, I was able to install 18+ inches of loc extensions.  What an wonderful length to work with!  As mentioned I ordered a second mannequin head because the price was right.  I am happy I discovered this synthetic hair mannequin.  And, I would not be surprised if I were to buy another one, provided that it was priced the same.</li>
            <li> I PURCHASED THIS SO THAT I COULD PRACTICE TO PUT IN MY OWN BOX BRAIDS.  I HAD TO CUT THE HAIR.  THE HAIR IS TO SLIPPERY.  I WISH THEY HAD A AFRICAN AMERICAN HAIR MODEL</li>
            <li> hair gets very frizzy, very easily</li>
            <li> I received this manikin head on time, but as I started to comb the hair and brush it, hair was every where.  It does that every time I comb or brush it and also the little stand that it came with had no instructions on how to put it together and I had to play the guessing game.  This head of hair should have been better than what it was.</li>
            <li> The hair is matted and nappy. It&#x27;s hard to get a wig brush through. It actually broke my brush. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> Mannequin is nice, but it losses a lot of hair when you comb or brush it. But other then that it is ok.</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter (She&#x27;s 7) for Christmas. She likes to play hair dresser. The look on her face when she pulled a head out of a box was priceless.. but once I explained what it was to her, she wanted to play with it right away!</li>
            <li> I wanted to practice braiding which I did and for the price I can&#x27;t complain. I was disappointed when I went to use a curling iron to style the hair and it melted I&#x27;m new to all the fake hair stuff. Ultimately I got several laughs from watchibg my son with her, he was obsessed with kissing mommy&#x27;s babydoll</li>
            <li> The mannequin hair sheds extremely a lot and gets tangled very easily.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly for what I needed</li>
            <li> Yes they worked for teaching hairbraiding.  The first day, mass amounts of hair shed. The hair also matted up badly.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my daughter as Christmas girft, she loves it!</li>
