            <li> Very sharp and got delivered on time.</li>
            <li> This product is small, and compact.</li>

            <li> Ordered these clippers because I wanted something that could cut very sharp without having to use a razor (and these do just that). This product is small, and compact. Runs on 1 AA Battery. Once the battery starts to die out, the clippers obviously don&#x27;t work as well. But the money you&#x27;ll constantly spend on batteries (and replacement blades like a lot of people do) you would be better for spending $50 in the Andis T Outliner clippers and saving money that way in the long run.</li>
            <li> this is not a trimmer, just a mini clipper</li>
            <li> Great clipper,I love them for the reason of getting those tricky angles on my beard that I usually can&#x27;t get with my Andis T-Wide. It cuts the hair very smoothly, I can really get my beard to the shape of my desire with this clipper......</li>
            <li> Zero gap da blades and get to work, I love them!!!!</li>
            <li> These are good trimmers, but I though they might be a little more fine toothed than my cheap Conair beard trimmer.  Nope... about the same.  These are wider and more comfortable.  I don&#x27;t like the small single battery design.  The motor bogs down unless you keep a relatively new battery in it.</li>
            <li> make sure to oil your clippers! very good, precise, feel like a barber using this thing.</li>
            <li> These things are frigen amazing. Doesn&#x27;t matter that it&#x27;s battery powered these things cut. I got about 9 months of all the time use out of these things. Great especially when you&#x27;re overseas and can&#x27;t get the voltage right for the other edgers.</li>
            <li> Great product and more powerful than I thought. I also like how it handles rough and wet hair so well. Not to mention it takes Double(AA) batteries</li>
            <li> DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY, THIS THING IS HORRIBLE, YOU ARE BETTER OFF BUYING A BEARD TRIMMER FOR 15-20 BUCKS</li>
            <li> This trimmer is great it&#x27;s small it doesn&#x27;t get hot and it has a great price to guality ratio and while it doesn&#x27;t get as close as other trimmers on the market do I personally love it and would 100% recommend someone to buy it</li>
            <li> Works pretty good for the money! Buy it!</li>
            <li> Is one of the greates trimmer is so power full and sharp it would made your job a lot easier that you guys think I&#x27;ve a barber for 6 years an this is the first trimmer that is so nice to work with I do a lot I desings this wahl g whiz is perfect for it all this barber out there I highly recommend for all of you it would look more cool if they have it like in a gold color but the quality is great I love it</li>
            <li> This wahl trimmer are great for edge or liner</li>
            <li> NICE! Very sharp and got delivered on time.</li>

Bought  it instead of blade now do you really need both?  Yes . Why not both to me great trimmers</li>
