My skin feels so smooth and refreshing after I use it.  I also like that it has a pump so you can control how much product you use much easier than just pouring it out of the bottle.  Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Love this Toner!!  Pump bottle is great and with only a cotton ball to apply.  Goes on great and smells devine.  Makes your skin feso refreshing.  I have very sensitive skin and love that it is alcohol free with no stinging or irritation.  Very Very Happy with this Toner and I would most difinitely recommend it for anyone.</li>

            <li> Love this product!  It has a nice citrus smell and leaves my skin feeling so smooth.  I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good toner that I can use until the bottle is empty without getting a tingling/ burning sensation. I have very sensitive skin, which is very thin and very prone to acne. I use toner twice daily after washing my face an before a moisturizer.  This toner is hydrating and doesn&#x27;t give my sensitive skin a burning sensation. However I haven&#x27;t used it long enough.  Usually my problem with toner happens when I use up to half of a bottle, then I have to switch to a different brand. It has vitamin C so I can skip my vitamin C serum step. The container is big and the spray nozzle is easy to use and sanitary. I spray the liquid on a cotton pad and wipe it all over my face. You can also reapply toner in the middle of the day to keep the skin moist and clean the excessive oil off your face. My only complaint about this toner is it&#x27;s orange color. I think adding color to a beauty product is unnecessary.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. My face feels refreshed and the citrus scent is invigorating. My makeup goes smooth afterwards.  I gave it four stars out of five because I wish the toner was not tined orange. I would prefer applying a clear product after I wash my face. Beside the color I enjoying using it.</li>
            <li> I really like this toner.  The scent is fabulous and is not harsh on my sensitive skin.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing toner....I do think it may not be for oily skin though. It was gentle on my skin...with a nice citrus scent</li>
            <li> I love this toner. The smell is amazing. It seems to wake me up in the morning, yet strangely it also helps to relax me at night. My face is also feeling tighter since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
            <li> Love this toner! Comes with a sprayer but it&#x27;s best to spray on a cotton pad and not directly on face. It smells great and feels very refreshing! Big bottle</li>
            <li> My skin is a mixture of dry and oily depending on the time of year.For me, after using it makes the dry spots feel more hydrated. The product also smells really good, its like a fruity citrus smell. I apply my face mosturizer over it and it makes my face feel more refreshed. I happy with it and will continue to use it :)</li>
            <li> I have used this product only for a short time and will be using this for now on.  My skin has never been finer looking  I will be purchasing this again and again!!!</li>
            <li> Product feels clean going on, and no stinging! Smells like fresh oranges. I apply between my face wash and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Just received this the other day and I love it.  I was out mowing my lawn and ended up with a sunburn on my face,neck and shoulders...sprayed this on and man what a difference it took out all the heat and sting.  Smells great also.</li>
            <li> I love this toner! My family and I went out on the boat and when I got out of the water this toner was great to use to wash off all the crud that&#x27;s in the water and it leaves your skin feeling clean and very refreshed. C Toner is also great for everyday use. I use it in the morning and it wakes up my skin and gives it a fresh glow. The smell is so refreshing my kids call it the &amp;#34;orange juice face spray&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s safe to use on the kids and a must have in my beach bag. I bought a second toner for everyday use as well. Give this a try this summer, I promise you will LOVE it!</li>
            <li> After using the Best Vitamin C Hydrating Toner for 10 days, I noticed an improvement in the softness of my skin, the color seemed to be more uniform, and my skin had a nice glow to it. I like the spray nozzle, so I didn&#x27;t have to take the cap off &amp; on. The scent is fresh &amp; delicious. I&#x27;m eager to try other products in this line.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot. The scent is fantastic! Very large quantity, and the packaging is great (spray bottle). Use it daily and would definitely purchase again!</li>
