            <li>I have tried so many lotions that claim to be the best, none really worked.  </li>
            <li>This lotion in the Cucumber/Jasmine is wonderful will purchase another bottle very soon, really enjoyed the thickness of the lotion</li>
            <li>This has a very strong &amp;#34;foofy&amp;#34; synthetic fragrance that I couldn&#x27;t stand, and neither could my family.</li>
            <li>Love the very light scent of this body lotion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of my top 3 favorite lotions ever.</li>
            <li>I love this brand of lotion but the scent of this one isn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li>We love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the way this lotion leaves my skin feeling.</li>
            <li>This is made of herbal extracts instead of the \\&quot;pertrolatum\\&quot; ingredient found in so many moisturizing lotions and creams.</li>
            <li>Its ok, but</li>
            <li>LOVE THE SMELL</li>
            <li>It smells great and it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Love this and will buy again when the rest of my body lotions run out.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>This lotion really provides great moisturizing that is long-lasting and not greasy in any way.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would be more floral smelling but its not.</li>
            <li>I love the hempz brand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try citrus blossom, hopefully it&#x27;ll be better than smelling like a cucumber.</li>
            <li>The Lotion is wonderful, different scent.</li>
            <li>Its my husbands favorite.</li>
            <li>You get a better price on line for this product rather than buying it in a salon.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the smell of the cucumber jasmine!</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.</li>
            <li>My wife loves all these different types of hempz she says they are the best thing out there</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s safe for my children as well.</li>
            <li>I love this Cucumber and Jasmine.  </li>
            <li>feel most massage oils leave.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer and the scent...</li>
            <li>The cream is very rich and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I will continue to buy it for as long as it is produced.</li>
            <li>Received exactly what I wanted, on time and for a good price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I found it&#x27;s pretty good for massages, as it absorbs into the skin without that greasy</li>
            <li>Happily, the psoriasis completely disappeared.</li>
            <li>Its a great moisturizer along with a soft scent.</li>
            <li>Gentle fragrance and good staying power without greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>Also, I had forgotten to pack my face cleanser and special face lotion!</li>
            <li>I have tried some of the other scents in the Hempz products, and like the cucumber/jasmine best.</li>
            <li>why i dont like other lotions and this is perfect!</li>
            <li>Quick and easy transaction!  </li>
            <li>I have always loved Hemps lotions, the new scent is fresh!&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin smooth and feeling healthy.</li>
            <li>Remove the strong scent and make a guy scent, and I will order a bunch along with 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I like the clean smell...and this is exactly that!!!</li>
            <li>I really like the original, but this lotion smells really good too.</li>
            <li>All is fine , wish this item and fragrance wasn&amp;#34;t  discontinued</li>
            <li>is better this one dries up really quick and it feels like its made from soup....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smells more like baby powder/lotion and is very powerful, but not completely unpleasant.  </li>
            <li>Very good quality, and came faster than expected.</li>
            <li>Absorbs into skin very well, nice smell.</li>
            <li>Wish it available for Subscribe and Save option.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion this sent is fresh and feels silky and cool!!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really enjoy Hempz products.</li>
            <li>but that is why I ordered all that you had available.</li>
            <li>, I used this primarily to soothe itching caused by medication, sunburns, or rashes, as well as moisturize after shaving.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cooling, refreshing smell; to me, it smells just like cucumber but not so much jasmine, since jasmine has more of a strong, sweet smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My favorite is the cucumber &amp; jasmine but other scents are great too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s GREAT in every other way! :)</li>
            <li>I would definintely go with the original over this.</li>
            <li>I prefer the original version, thus why I gave it a 4</li>
            <li>I also recommend the original also too.</li>
            <li>I use the Original Herbal Body Moisturizer after the shower, but I have the Cucumber &amp; Jasmine Moisturizer on my night stand because that&#x27;s the one I like to use before bed.  </li>
            <li>but I acutally prefer the original scent.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll stick to the original scent.</li>
            <li>Also, I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the smell (much better than the Original, which can get overpowering after a few hours of having it on.)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy to be able to purchase many of these online,as opposed to the local beauty stores,selling it for about double.</li>
            <li>I like the mild scent, and the great lotion for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>She said it made her feet feel so much better because they felt so much softer and smoother.  </li>
            <li>You might think you&#x27;re buying some kind of all natural hippety dippety hand lotion.</li>
            <li>I love this particular scent.  </li>
            <li>I love using this lotion and particularly the cucumer scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;(The merchant did include a free can of some kind of hair mousse, but the smell of that was equally offensive.</li>
            <li>Smells good, more jasmine than cucumber, but not strong.</li>
            <li>It obsorbs quickly, never greasy and has a light pleasant scent that isn&#x27;t over powering.  </li>
            <li>and I just fell in love with it, but couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere around where I live.  </li>
            <li>The lotion itself is actually pretty good - not greasy, quick to dry - but the smell is downright offensive.</li>
            <li>Its amazing lotion that I can use on my face without making it oily as well as my entire body.</li>
            <li>Top of this container was completely smashed in on arrival and lotion was all over in packaging.</li>
            <li>Fresh, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>They carry many natural herbal choices for this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>And it does not p, the cucumber wins.</li>
            <li>I love all of the hempz lotions, they all smell great and they are very different from other lotions i have, they also keep my skin moisturized in the winter and after tanning</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll most likely order the original then.</li>
            <li>favorite sent is the original once it&#x27;s applied the sent changes on the individual wearing it.</li>
            <li>Love this product but felt true price should have been posted since this item was sold by a seller outside the U.S.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only giving it two stars instead of one because it actually has some really great ingredients in it.</li>
            <li>I use this lotion all over my body and even feel comfortable using it on my young daughters.    </li>
            <li>I use it every day after my shave, and my cheeks feel nourished for 24 hours straight!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still pretty pricey.</li>
            <li>Just received the other day and LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>but it was well worth it because the bottle came completely sealed in plastic which is reassuring to me because I know I&#x27;m getting the full 18 oz and no one else</li>
            <li>Wanted a different scent, love the Cucumber and Jasmine.</li>
            <li>Someone gave me about a half bottle of the original many yeas ago</li>
            <li>Some of the ingredients had been changed and the previous bottle that I liked was distributed by Supre, Inc, whereas the bottle I&#x27;m reviewing now, was distributed by Hemp Technologies, LLC.</li>
            <li>I love hempz products...great for dry skin to soften and heal.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just such a STRONG scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So this lotion is not the best quality not sure y the other&#x27;s</li>
            <li>The first hempz lotion I bought was the original at a local beauty supply store for about $20..</li>
            <li>The lotion is of a medium thickness but it absorbs immediately, it is creamy, not greasy, and not oily, and I love the delicate scent of the jasmine, for me it is a soothing light fragrance that relaxes me to sleep after</li>
            <li>The scent is light enough that it will not over power your perfume.</li>
            <li>Otherwise than that I really like this product.</li>
            <li>The whole order is now in the trashcan.)</li>
            <li>never thought I would complain about too MUCH scent, but who wants to be the girl walking around leaving a trail of people rubbing at their noses to get the smell out??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really helps with my Psoriasis.</li>
            <li>(gee mom, thanks for stealing the rest of the bottle)</li>
            <li>I have a really good sense of smell, i mean like a dog</li>
            <li>Soaks right in and leaves skin soft and moist.</li>
            <li>This is a nice cucumber subtle smell and last most of the day.  </li>
            <li>When I ordered this, I didn&#x27;t notice the specific scent and just assumed it would be the original scent.</li>
            <li>I will probably switch up ordering this scent and the original, just for variation, and will definitely continue ordering this product.</li>
            <li>Lotion texture and feel is different from the original and pomegranate fragrances.</li>
            <li>You can go to any discount store and buy a top name brand such as Elizabeth Arden and it would be just as good for less than half the money.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended this item.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li>Nothing worked long term, so I just lived with it and always kept my face clean and</li>
            <li>maybe a little lacking in the Jasmine department, but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>so I ordered a few more bottles.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t worth my time to send it back.</li>
            <li>So overall I&#x27;m pleased with my order, but when it runs out (which with the size of the bottle will be a very long time from now...</li>
            <li>I live in Florida</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the scent lingers for a long long time.  </li>
            <li>On super dry days I will use this as a body lotion.</li>
            <li>larger size lasts a long time and dispenses easily and doesn&#x27;t leave a lot you can&#x27;t get to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Light but long lasting scent.</li>
            <li>It was a huge mess.</li>
            <li>I came upon Hempz quite by accident, started using it and low and behold, it really works.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, look elsewhere for a natural lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but has become far too pricey.</li>
            <li>it was the first lotion I used on my hands all winter that eased the dry, cracked feeling.  </li>
            <li>It is absorbed easily into the skin without a shine, does not feel greasy, and leaves behind only the slightest bit of a scent.</li>
            <li>I love this product as it not only softens, moistens skin, it is also not overwhelming with a scent thus doesn&#x27;t interfere with cologne if worn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My only complaint would be I tried the cucumber &amp; Jasmine scent hoping it was more Jasmine</li>
            <li>Pomegranate is my fav scent so far next</li>
            <li>The scent is really fresh and oozes relaxation.</li>
            <li>It did not have either a cucumber or jasmine smell, rather a stale kind of odor.  </li>
            <li>The staff member sold this moisturizer (and body wash) to me by claiming that it does not have paraffin or petroleum products, and it will not cause the spray tan to disappear as fast as other brands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for the past few weeks, it&#x27;s such a great lotion, after a few uses I&#x27;ve seen major improvement in the softness of the skin.</li>
            <li>It helps hold and make my tan last much longer than other lotions.</li>
            <li>Keeps moisture in and makes your skin feel soft and silky all day long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and leaves your skin so soft all day long!</li>

            <li> I have tried so many lotions that claim to be the best, none really worked.  </li>
            <li> This lotion in the Cucumber/Jasmine is wonderful will purchase another bottle very soon, really enjoyed the thickness of the lotion</li>
            <li> This has a very strong &amp;#34;foofy&amp;#34; synthetic fragrance that I couldn&#x27;t stand, and neither could my family.</li>
            <li> Love the very light scent of this body lotion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of my top 3 favorite lotions ever.</li>
            <li> I love this brand of lotion but the scent of this one isn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li> We love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the way this lotion leaves my skin feeling.</li>
            <li> This is made of herbal extracts instead of the \\&quot;pertrolatum\\&quot; ingredient found in so many moisturizing lotions and creams.</li>
            <li> Its ok, but</li>
            <li> LOVE THE SMELL</li>
            <li> It smells great and it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Love this and will buy again when the rest of my body lotions run out.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> This lotion really provides great moisturizing that is long-lasting and not greasy in any way.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would be more floral smelling but its not.</li>
            <li> I love the hempz brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try citrus blossom, hopefully it&#x27;ll be better than smelling like a cucumber.</li>
            <li> The Lotion is wonderful, different scent.</li>
            <li> Its my husbands favorite.</li>
            <li> You get a better price on line for this product rather than buying it in a salon.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the smell of the cucumber jasmine!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.</li>
            <li> My wife loves all these different types of hempz she says they are the best thing out there</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s safe for my children as well.</li>
            <li> I love this Cucumber and Jasmine.  </li>
            <li> feel most massage oils leave.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer and the scent...</li>
            <li> The cream is very rich and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I will continue to buy it for as long as it is produced.</li>
            <li> Received exactly what I wanted, on time and for a good price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I found it&#x27;s pretty good for massages, as it absorbs into the skin without that greasy</li>
            <li> Happily, the psoriasis completely disappeared.</li>
            <li> Its a great moisturizer along with a soft scent.</li>
            <li> Gentle fragrance and good staying power without greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Also, I had forgotten to pack my face cleanser and special face lotion!</li>
            <li> I have tried some of the other scents in the Hempz products, and like the cucumber/jasmine best.</li>
            <li> why i dont like other lotions and this is perfect!</li>
            <li> Quick and easy transaction!  </li>
            <li> I have always loved Hemps lotions, the new scent is fresh!&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin smooth and feeling healthy.</li>
            <li> Remove the strong scent and make a guy scent, and I will order a bunch along with 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I like the clean smell...and this is exactly that!!!</li>
            <li> I really like the original, but this lotion smells really good too.</li>
            <li> All is fine , wish this item and fragrance wasn&amp;#34;t  discontinued</li>
            <li> is better this one dries up really quick and it feels like its made from soup....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells more like baby powder/lotion and is very powerful, but not completely unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> Very good quality, and came faster than expected.</li>
            <li> Absorbs into skin very well, nice smell.</li>
            <li> Wish it available for Subscribe and Save option.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion this sent is fresh and feels silky and cool!!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really enjoy Hempz products.</li>
            <li> but that is why I ordered all that you had available.</li>
            <li> , I used this primarily to soothe itching caused by medication, sunburns, or rashes, as well as moisturize after shaving.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cooling, refreshing smell; to me, it smells just like cucumber but not so much jasmine, since jasmine has more of a strong, sweet smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My favorite is the cucumber &amp; jasmine but other scents are great too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s GREAT in every other way! :)</li>
            <li> I would definintely go with the original over this.</li>
            <li> I prefer the original version, thus why I gave it a 4</li>
            <li> I also recommend the original also too.</li>
            <li> I use the Original Herbal Body Moisturizer after the shower, but I have the Cucumber &amp; Jasmine Moisturizer on my night stand because that&#x27;s the one I like to use before bed.  </li>
            <li> but I acutally prefer the original scent.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll stick to the original scent.</li>
            <li> Also, I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the smell (much better than the Original, which can get overpowering after a few hours of having it on.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to be able to purchase many of these online,as opposed to the local beauty stores,selling it for about double.</li>
            <li> I like the mild scent, and the great lotion for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> She said it made her feet feel so much better because they felt so much softer and smoother.  </li>
            <li> You might think you&#x27;re buying some kind of all natural hippety dippety hand lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this particular scent.  </li>
            <li> I love using this lotion and particularly the cucumer scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(The merchant did include a free can of some kind of hair mousse, but the smell of that was equally offensive.</li>
            <li> Smells good, more jasmine than cucumber, but not strong.</li>
            <li> It obsorbs quickly, never greasy and has a light pleasant scent that isn&#x27;t over powering.  </li>
            <li> and I just fell in love with it, but couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere around where I live.  </li>
            <li> The lotion itself is actually pretty good - not greasy, quick to dry - but the smell is downright offensive.</li>
            <li> Its amazing lotion that I can use on my face without making it oily as well as my entire body.</li>
            <li> Top of this container was completely smashed in on arrival and lotion was all over in packaging.</li>
            <li> Fresh, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> They carry many natural herbal choices for this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> And it does not p, the cucumber wins.</li>
            <li> I love all of the hempz lotions, they all smell great and they are very different from other lotions i have, they also keep my skin moisturized in the winter and after tanning</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll most likely order the original then.</li>
            <li> favorite sent is the original once it&#x27;s applied the sent changes on the individual wearing it.</li>
            <li> Love this product but felt true price should have been posted since this item was sold by a seller outside the U.S.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving it two stars instead of one because it actually has some really great ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> I use this lotion all over my body and even feel comfortable using it on my young daughters.    </li>
            <li> I use it every day after my shave, and my cheeks feel nourished for 24 hours straight!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still pretty pricey.</li>
            <li> Just received the other day and LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> but it was well worth it because the bottle came completely sealed in plastic which is reassuring to me because I know I&#x27;m getting the full 18 oz and no one else</li>
            <li> Wanted a different scent, love the Cucumber and Jasmine.</li>
            <li> Someone gave me about a half bottle of the original many yeas ago</li>
            <li> Some of the ingredients had been changed and the previous bottle that I liked was distributed by Supre, Inc, whereas the bottle I&#x27;m reviewing now, was distributed by Hemp Technologies, LLC.</li>
            <li> I love hempz products...great for dry skin to soften and heal.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just such a STRONG scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So this lotion is not the best quality not sure y the other&#x27;s</li>
            <li> The first hempz lotion I bought was the original at a local beauty supply store for about $20..</li>
            <li> The lotion is of a medium thickness but it absorbs immediately, it is creamy, not greasy, and not oily, and I love the delicate scent of the jasmine, for me it is a soothing light fragrance that relaxes me to sleep after</li>
            <li> The scent is light enough that it will not over power your perfume.</li>
            <li> Otherwise than that I really like this product.</li>
            <li> The whole order is now in the trashcan.)</li>
            <li> never thought I would complain about too MUCH scent, but who wants to be the girl walking around leaving a trail of people rubbing at their noses to get the smell out??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really helps with my Psoriasis.</li>
            <li> (gee mom, thanks for stealing the rest of the bottle)</li>
            <li> I have a really good sense of smell, i mean like a dog</li>
            <li> Soaks right in and leaves skin soft and moist.</li>
            <li> This is a nice cucumber subtle smell and last most of the day.  </li>
            <li> When I ordered this, I didn&#x27;t notice the specific scent and just assumed it would be the original scent.</li>
            <li> I will probably switch up ordering this scent and the original, just for variation, and will definitely continue ordering this product.</li>
            <li> Lotion texture and feel is different from the original and pomegranate fragrances.</li>
            <li> You can go to any discount store and buy a top name brand such as Elizabeth Arden and it would be just as good for less than half the money.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended this item.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> Nothing worked long term, so I just lived with it and always kept my face clean and</li>
            <li> maybe a little lacking in the Jasmine department, but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> so I ordered a few more bottles.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t worth my time to send it back.</li>
            <li> So overall I&#x27;m pleased with my order, but when it runs out (which with the size of the bottle will be a very long time from now...</li>
            <li> I live in Florida</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the scent lingers for a long long time.  </li>
            <li> On super dry days I will use this as a body lotion.</li>
            <li> larger size lasts a long time and dispenses easily and doesn&#x27;t leave a lot you can&#x27;t get to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Light but long lasting scent.</li>
            <li> It was a huge mess.</li>
            <li> I came upon Hempz quite by accident, started using it and low and behold, it really works.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, look elsewhere for a natural lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but has become far too pricey.</li>
            <li> it was the first lotion I used on my hands all winter that eased the dry, cracked feeling.  </li>
            <li> It is absorbed easily into the skin without a shine, does not feel greasy, and leaves behind only the slightest bit of a scent.</li>
            <li> I love this product as it not only softens, moistens skin, it is also not overwhelming with a scent thus doesn&#x27;t interfere with cologne if worn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be I tried the cucumber &amp; Jasmine scent hoping it was more Jasmine</li>
            <li> Pomegranate is my fav scent so far next</li>
            <li> The scent is really fresh and oozes relaxation.</li>
            <li> It did not have either a cucumber or jasmine smell, rather a stale kind of odor.  </li>
            <li> The staff member sold this moisturizer (and body wash) to me by claiming that it does not have paraffin or petroleum products, and it will not cause the spray tan to disappear as fast as other brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past few weeks, it&#x27;s such a great lotion, after a few uses I&#x27;ve seen major improvement in the softness of the skin.</li>
            <li> It helps hold and make my tan last much longer than other lotions.</li>
            <li> Keeps moisture in and makes your skin feel soft and silky all day long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and leaves your skin so soft all day long!</li>
            <li> As soon as you put it on, it soaks right into your skin and moisturizes it, without making you feel the least bit oily.</li>
            <li> It has a delicate and fresh scent that lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually put lotion on my whole body after my shower, but I can&#x27;t do that with this....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recently, I tried one of those new spray on tans before departing on a little vacation.</li>
            <li> get a cosmetologist discount and got this for a little less than $10 in stores, so the fact that Amazon is selling it for that same discounted price is a real steal!</li>
            <li> I noticed the smell and feel of the lotion was far from the previous bottle.</li>
            <li> I have long suffered from two spots of psoriasis on my face.</li>
            <li> Strange because it was within bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> Hydrates your skin well and for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if that makes a difference, but I do know that I dont like the new bottle.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the original was sold out, but they had the Cucumber and Jasmine for sale.  </li>
            <li> daughters swipe a squirt regularly, even though they have plenty of other choices conveniently located in their rooms.</li>
            <li> AND HOW IT HELPS WITH REALLY DRY SKIN.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin, and since moving to the desert over 10 years ago, it has been a challenge for me to keep moisturized.  </li>
            <li> to sum up my review, Hempz Herbal Moisturizer, is creamy and absorbs immediately, there is no greasy or oily film to stain or ruin clothing, softens and heals scaly dry skin, and protects me from all the drying effects of living in the desert.</li>
            <li> The skin on my feet is always dry and sometimes cracks.  </li>
            <li> Many other less expensive lotions do the job.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed as Hempz products are generally very nice.</li>
            <li> Have been buying this product for the last few years.</li>
            <li> It does not leave a wet feeling.</li>
            <li> I keep a big bottle by my bedside and a small bottle in my purse.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try the other scents</li>
            <li> I also use it on a few dry patches I have on my ankles.</li>
            <li> It also leaves your hands feeling oily for a few minutes after use which can be frustrating when you&#x27;ve used it while trying to get ready in the morning.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge lotion fan because I hate the greasy feel most of them give me</li>
            <li> and I still have half the 17oz bottle.</li>
            <li> This bottle of hand lotion was $10 less than what it costs at the salon where I get my hair done...</li>
            <li> The cost at Amazon is MUCH less than stores in my area.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The jasmine is a little heavy though.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes, but doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy.</li>
            <li> I saved a few dollars ordering it through amazon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Hempz lotion for a few years now after receiving a sample size bottle as a gift one year.</li>
            <li> No allergy problems because no strong chemical odors.</li>
            <li> I borrowed it one day this past winter....</li>
            <li> I was forced to use both the body wash and the moisturizer on my face, hoping that the damage wouldn&#x27;t be so bad that I would have some sort of psoriasis explosion on my whole face.</li>
            <li> This stuff has such an overpowering artificial perfume, the homeless could use it for job interviews.</li>
            <li> so I was also worried it would be too thick because thats also</li>
            <li> I lotion myself with this, I&#x27;m afraid half the people in my office will get headaches from it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too bad they go so heavy on the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Forget the expensive prices at the tanning salon</li>
            <li> So sad that you cannot find it any longer in STL.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So if you&#x27;re the type of person who likes fake flowers, plastic fruit, and smelling like a car air freshener, then this product is for you.</li>
            <li> I USE THIS PRODUCT EVERYDAY!!!!!</li>
            <li> Was shocked when I got the bill.  </li>
            <li> After 20 years of two troublesome spots making my life miserable, they just went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are looking to cover up some of the worst BO, this is the stuff will do it and then some.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge lotion fan because I hate the greasy feel most of them give me but Hempz is an exception. It&#x27;s one of my top 3 favorite lotions ever. As soon as you put it on, it soaks right into your skin and moisturizes it, without making you feel the least bit oily. Also, I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the smell (much better than the Original, which can get overpowering after a few hours of having it on.) It&#x27;s a cooling, refreshing smell; to me, it smells just like cucumber but not so much jasmine, since jasmine has more of a strong, sweet smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get a cosmetologist discount and got this for a little less than $10 in stores, so the fact that Amazon is selling it for that same discounted price is a real steal!</li>
            <li> Love the very light scent of this body lotion. Soaks right in and leaves skin soft and moist. No allergy problems because no strong chemical odors. Thank you Hempz!</li>
            <li> This has to be the best lotion on the market.  It doesn&#x27;t matter what scent you get, they are all  wonderful.  I&#x27;m a life time customer!</li>
            <li> I love this brand of lotion but the scent of this one isn&#x27;t my favorite. I would definintely go with the original over this.</li>
            <li> Someone gave me about a half bottle of the original many yeas ago and I just fell in love with it, but couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere around where I live.  So one day I hopped on Amazon.com and just wanted to see if they had it.  Unfortunately the original was sold out, but they had the Cucumber and Jasmine for sale.  I use a cucumber scented perfume so I decided to order it and try it out.    Well it arrived today, in excellent condition, and I tried it out immediately.  It&#x27;s still as moisturizing and silky as I remember, but the smell was not what I was expecting.  It&#x27;s smells more like baby powder/lotion and is very powerful, but not completely unpleasant.  And thankfully it won&#x27;t clash with my perfume nor my deodorant.  So overall I&#x27;m pleased with my order, but when it runs out (which with the size of the bottle will be a very long time from now...LOL) I&#x27;ll most likely order the original then.</li>
            <li> My mom was given a sample of this lotion from her hairdresser.  I borrowed it one day this past winter....it was the first lotion I used on my hands all winter that eased the dry, cracked feeling.  My Mom had to start chemotherapy.  During chemo, her feet started to cramp.  I took out this lotion and used it to rub and massage my Mom&#x27;s feet.    She said it made her feet feel so much better because they felt so much softer and smoother.  The smell is great, too.  We love this product.</li>
            <li> I prefer the original version, thus why I gave it a 4*. It also leaves your hands feeling oily for a few minutes after use which can be frustrating when you&#x27;ve used it while trying to get ready in the morning.     It&#x27;s a year later and I still have half the 17oz bottle. I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this, I didn&#x27;t notice the specific scent and just assumed it would be the original scent. I really like the original, but this lotion smells really good too. The scent is really fresh and oozes relaxation. I love the way this lotion leaves my skin feeling. It moisturizes, but doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy. The feeling lasts for hours, too. I use this lotion all over my body and even feel comfortable using it on my young daughters.    I will probably switch up ordering this scent and the original, just for variation, and will definitely continue ordering this product.</li>
            <li> This is perhaps the best moisturizer that I&#x27;ve used! It is absorbed easily into the skin without a shine, does not feel greasy, and leaves behind only the slightest bit of a scent. I use it every day after my shave, and my cheeks feel nourished for 24 hours straight! This is made of herbal extracts instead of the \\&quot;pertrolatum\\&quot; ingredient found in so many moisturizing lotions and creams.</li>
            <li> A friend gave me a bottle about 10 years ago and have been using it ever since. Highly recommended this item.</li>
            <li> This product may have outworn its shelf life.  It did not have either a cucumber or jasmine smell, rather a stale kind of odor.  Was very disappointed as Hempz products are generally very nice.</li>
            <li> Have been buying this product for the last few years. I like the mild scent, and the great lotion for dry skin.  I have tried some of the other scents in the Hempz products, and like the cucumber/jasmine best.</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of the cucumber &amp; jasmine herbal body moisturizer about two years ago and I finally ran out. I loved it! However, when I ordered this bottle (the one being reviewed), something was different about it. I noticed the smell and feel of the lotion was far from the previous bottle. Some of the ingredients had been changed and the previous bottle that I liked was distributed by Supre, Inc, whereas the bottle I&#x27;m reviewing now, was distributed by Hemp Technologies, LLC. I&#x27;m not sure if that makes a difference, but I do know that I dont like the new bottle. Its ok, but I&#x27;ll probably try to order from Supre, Inc next time. Thank you for reading.</li>
            <li> I was kind of nervous before getting this because of the smell... I have a really good sense of smell, i mean like a dog and I dont like to smell like a fruit or like vanilla.. I like the clean smell...and this is exactly that!!! I live in Florida so I was also worried it would be too thick because thats also why i dont like other lotions and this is perfect!! I will forver buy this!!!</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT!  LOVE THE SMELL AND HOW IT HELPS WITH REALLY DRY SKIN.  I USE THIS PRODUCT EVERYDAY!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! Forget the expensive prices at the tanning salon</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the scent lingers for a long long time.  I also recommend the original also too.</li>
            <li> The scent is light enough that it will not over power your perfume. The cream is very rich and moisturizing. It does not leave a wet feeling.</li>
            <li> This bottle of hand lotion was $10 less than what it costs at the salon where I get my hair done... but it&#x27;s still pretty pricey. Guess I just can&#x27;t resist treating myself... compensation for Wisconsin winters? I keep a big bottle by my bedside and a small bottle in my purse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to be able to purchase many of these online,as opposed to the local beauty stores,selling it for about double.</li>
            <li> Just received the other day and LOVE IT! Gentle fragrance and good staying power without greasy feeling. Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Ths product is awesome! It smells great and it is very moisturizing. you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I have long suffered from two spots of psoriasis on my face. Nothing worked long term, so I just lived with it and always kept my face clean and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I tried one of those new spray on tans before departing on a little vacation. The staff member sold this moisturizer (and body wash) to me by claiming that it does not have paraffin or petroleum products, and it will not cause the spray tan to disappear as fast as other brands. While the price at the tanning business was greatly inflated, I purchased it in the hopes that what she said was true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My spray tan lasted almost a week. Also, I had forgotten to pack my face cleanser and special face lotion! I was forced to use both the body wash and the moisturizer on my face, hoping that the damage wouldn&#x27;t be so bad that I would have some sort of psoriasis explosion on my whole face. Happily, the psoriasis completely disappeared. After 20 years of two troublesome spots making my life miserable, they just went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more expensive $50 bottles of facial moisturizer. This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I will continue to buy it for as long as it is produced.</li>
            <li> This has a very strong &amp;#34;foofy&amp;#34; synthetic fragrance that I couldn&#x27;t stand, and neither could my family. I had to give it to a friend who doesn&#x27;t mind smelling like a perfume factory. I&#x27;m only giving it two stars instead of one because it actually has some really great ingredients in it. Too bad they go so heavy on the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love this particular scent.  So sad that you cannot find it any longer in STL.</li>
            <li> We love this lotion and I especially love the summery smell; smells a bit of banana. Light but long lasting scent. Moisture all day and night, not greasy. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great for after tanning. It helps hold and make my tan last much longer than other lotions.</li>
            <li> So this lotion is not the best quality not sure y the other&#x27;s I&#x27;ve bought elsewhere is better this one dries up really quick and it feels like its made from soup....</li>
            <li> Love this and will buy again when the rest of my body lotions run out.  Absorbs into skin very well, nice smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past few weeks, it&#x27;s such a great lotion, after a few uses I&#x27;ve seen major improvement in the softness of the skin. Very good quality, and came faster than expected. Only problem I have with it is the smelly is a bit too cucumber scented. Otherwise than that I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, and since moving to the desert over 10 years ago, it has been a challenge for me to keep moisturized.  I am very happy with Hempz Body Moisturizer.  I use the Original Herbal Body Moisturizer after the shower, but I have the Cucumber &amp; Jasmine Moisturizer on my night stand because that&#x27;s the one I like to use before bed.  The lotion is of a medium thickness but it absorbs immediately, it is creamy, not greasy, and not oily, and I love the delicate scent of the jasmine, for me it is a soothing light fragrance that relaxes me to sleep after a hectic day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to sum up my review, Hempz Herbal Moisturizer, is creamy and absorbs immediately, there is no greasy or oily film to stain or ruin clothing, softens and heals scaly dry skin, and protects me from all the drying effects of living in the desert. The Cucumber &amp; Jasmine Moisturizing lotion is used before bed, for a relaxing, soothing nights sleep.</li>
            <li> A friend gave me a bottle last year as she didn&#x27;t like it. I tried it and I love it. Non greasy, great smelling, not overpowering at all. Keeps moisture in and makes your skin feel soft and silky all day long. The cost at Amazon is MUCH less than stores in my area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to everyone. You never know if you don&#x27;t try it.</li>
            <li> I have gotten this lotion several times and I will continue to purchase!  Its a great moisturizer along with a soft scent.</li>
            <li> This is a nice cucumber subtle smell and last most of the day.  Skin never gets cracked with this cream.  Use it on my heels too.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy transaction!  This lotion really provides great moisturizing that is long-lasting and not greasy in any way.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I wanted to see how the smell was but I acutally prefer the original scent.  This is good but not as good as I though it would smell.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife. Have no idea how she decided on this brand. Smells good, more jasmine than cucumber, but not strong. I prefer unscented, but it wasn&#x27;t for me. Absorbs well, and not too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughters swipe a squirt regularly, even though they have plenty of other choices conveniently located in their rooms. I suppose this is the best sort of endorsement.</li>
            <li> I have a thyroid problem.  The skin on my feet is always dry and sometimes cracks.  I have tried so many lotions that claim to be the best, none really worked.  I came upon Hempz quite by accident, started using it and low and behold, it really works.  I don&#x27;t ever want to be without it so I ordered a few more bottles.</li>
            <li> This lotion in the Cucumber/Jasmine is wonderful will purchase another bottle very soon, really enjoyed the thickness of the lotion</li>
            <li> The first hempz lotion I bought was the original at a local beauty supply store for about $20.. I saved a few dollars ordering it through amazon but it was well worth it because the bottle came completely sealed in plastic which is reassuring to me because I know I&#x27;m getting the full 18 oz and no one else has sampled it like they do in the store.. I love all of the hempz lotions, they all smell great and they are very different from other lotions i have, they also keep my skin moisturized in the winter and after tanning</li>
            <li> I love using this lotion and particularly the cucumer scent.</li>
            <li> Top of this container was completely smashed in on arrival and lotion was all over in packaging. It was a huge mess. Strange because it was within bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> You might think you&#x27;re buying some kind of all natural hippety dippety hand lotion. Think again. This stuff has such an overpowering artificial perfume, the homeless could use it for job interviews. The lotion itself is actually pretty good - not greasy, quick to dry - but the smell is downright offensive. I have to go wash my hands again to try and get the smell off me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re the type of person who likes fake flowers, plastic fruit, and smelling like a car air freshener, then this product is for you. Otherwise, look elsewhere for a natural lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(The merchant did include a free can of some kind of hair mousse, but the smell of that was equally offensive. The whole order is now in the trashcan.)</li>
            <li> I thought it would be more floral smelling but its not. I gave one to my daughter. I think I&#x27;ll stick to the original scent.</li>
            <li> I love the hempz brand. Its amazing lotion that I can use on my face without making it oily as well as my entire body. Plus its a tan extender! My only complaint would be I tried the cucumber &amp; Jasmine scent hoping it was more Jasmine but it just smells like cucumbers, no Jasmine, which I personally don&#x27;t like. Pomegranate is my fav scent so far next I&#x27;ll try citrus blossom, hopefully it&#x27;ll be better than smelling like a cucumber.</li>
            <li> All is fine , wish this item and fragrance wasn&amp;#34;t  discontinued</li>
            <li> Wanted a different scent, love the Cucumber and Jasmine. Fresh, not overpowering. Wish it available for Subscribe and Save option.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion. I want to love it! It rubs in well, it smells nice...  But the smell is also the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice scent... maybe a little lacking in the Jasmine department, but that&#x27;s okay. It&#x27;s just such a STRONG scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I lotion myself with this, I&#x27;m afraid half the people in my office will get headaches from it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually put lotion on my whole body after my shower, but I can&#x27;t do that with this....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never thought I would complain about too MUCH scent, but who wants to be the girl walking around leaving a trail of people rubbing at their noses to get the smell out??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not me. Hopefully not you either. Wish it wasn&#x27;t so smelly!! It&#x27;s GREAT in every other way! :)</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent and it&#x27;s the best lotion I use.  You can find it all over but this is the best price</li>
            <li> Love this lotion this sent is fresh and feels silky and cool!!!!&lt;br /&gt;My favorite sent is the original once it&#x27;s applied the sent changes on the individual wearing it.</li>
            <li> The Lotion is wonderful, different scent. Not as overpowering as some of the others. Its my husbands favorite. Hydrates your skin well and for a long time.</li>
            <li> I love this product as it not only softens, moistens skin, it is also not overwhelming with a scent thus doesn&#x27;t interfere with cologne if worn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The larger size lasts a long time and dispenses easily and doesn&#x27;t leave a lot you can&#x27;t get to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my third bottle of this and it has become a staple in my home.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve been using Hempz lotion for a few years now after receiving a sample size bottle as a gift one year. The cucumber and jasmine scent is very nice!</li>
            <li> Great lotion but has become far too pricey. Many other less expensive lotions do the job.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best Excellent Herbal Moisturizer I have used yet. For years I used Lubriderm, but now I use Hempz. It has good herbal content in it &amp; makes your skin feel really great. They carry many natural herbal choices for this moisturizer.  You get a better price on line for this product rather than buying it in a salon. Just buy one of these, use it every day or so, &amp; you will be ordering it like I do. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Loved the quality of that lotion . It hydrates without leaving a greasy film. My only concern: I was hoping that the jasmine smell would overcome the cucumber ... And it does not p, the cucumber wins.</li>
            <li> Hempz is the best skin lotion I have ever used. The jasmine is a little heavy though. My wife likes it but I prefer the pomegranate.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the smell of the cucumber jasmine! It isn&#x27;t too overpowering. On super dry days I will use this as a body lotion.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells great and absorbs easily with no sticky residue. I can&#x27;t wait to use it daily after my shower.</li>
            <li> The Hempz lotion is great stuff, I just wish there was a version that was not so darn fragrant!  The scents are just way too overpowering, and everywhere you go, everyone else is hit with the scent as well.  If you are looking to cover up some of the worst BO, this is the stuff will do it and then some.  Remove the strong scent and make a guy scent, and I will order a bunch along with 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Love this product but felt true price should have been posted since this item was sold by a seller outside the U.S.  Was shocked when I got the bill.  Have located local source for this product to prevent this surprise in the future.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion money can buy!! It&#x27;s not greasy and leaves your skin so soft all day long! Very happy with this product and i&#x27;m ordering more for myself and as gifts for friends and family! Great Product!!</li>
            <li> I love hempz products...great for dry skin to soften and heal.  Also awesome to use after being in the sun.</li>
            <li> Lotion texture and feel is different from the original and pomegranate fragrances. This fragrance doesn&#x27;t feel as good on your hands and body.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. It obsorbs quickly, never greasy and has a light pleasant scent that isn&#x27;t over powering.  I can&#x27;t wait to try the other scents</li>
            <li> You can go to any discount store and buy a top name brand such as Elizabeth Arden and it would be just as good for less than half the money.</li>
            <li> Received exactly what I wanted, on time and for a good price.&lt;br /&gt;I was very pleased with the experience and will order again.</li>
            <li> My wife loves all these different types of hempz she says they are the best thing out there</li>
            <li> Very good value.  Just what my Grandson likes, he has used this product for years and continues to use it.</li>
            <li> I have always loved Hemps lotions, the new scent is fresh!&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin smooth and feeling healthy. I would buy again!</li>
            <li> Probably the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used!  Great service and great product.  I highly recommend trying it. My favorite is the cucumber &amp; jasmine but other scents are great too.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy Hempz products. It&#x27;s really helps with my Psoriasis. It&#x27;s safe for my children as well. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Excellent product worth the money and the results is rewarding.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Great gift!</li>
            <li> I love this Cucumber and Jasmine.  It appears Hempz has stopped making it and I am so upset about that.  It&#x27;s the best fragrance they&#x27;ve ever made.  Hope they will bring it back but that is why I ordered all that you had available.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST PRODUCT THAT I HAVE EVER USED...EVERY TIME THAT I TRY ANOTHER CREAM OR LOTION, IT JUST DOES NOT MEASURE UP.</li>
            <li> I bought a sample of this a while back and I finally ran out of it (gee mom, thanks for stealing the rest of the bottle), I used this primarily to soothe itching caused by medication, sunburns, or rashes, as well as moisturize after shaving. I also use it on a few dry patches I have on my ankles. I found it&#x27;s pretty good for massages, as it absorbs into the skin without that greasy feel most massage oils leave. It has a delicate and fresh scent that lasts for a long time. Best to use in the morning!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer and the scent...but it came with a damaged pump.  It wasn&#x27;t worth my time to send it back.</li>
