            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I love SHANY products!</li>
            <li>I really love the colors and the staying power they have!  </li>
            <li>THIS IS AN AMAZING PALETTE.  </li>
            <li>but everything else is amazing</li>
            <li>Omg didn&#x27;t think that this product was sooo amazing</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>An amazing eyeshadow palette.</li>
            <li>The quality is amazing for the price.</li>
            <li>I had purchased all my Christmas gifts online this year including this amazing eyeshadow pallette.</li>
            <li>i think 192 was an honest mistake the 9 and 6 were switched</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a 5 1/4\\&quot; x 5 3/4\\&quot; mirror inside the case that is quite handy.  </li>
            <li>There is a nice variety of color, and using the primer helps to ensure long-lasting coverage.  </li>
            <li>Packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>It folds up nicely when you&#x27;re not using it too.</li>
            <li>She liked it.  </li>
            <li>But to each her own I guess.</li>
            <li>I love it great colors and easy to apply</li>
            <li>The colors are wonderful but my package was completely botched!</li>
            <li>all that matters is that u got a set of shades, a good price and fine quality.</li>
            <li>I would have liked more greens, and maybe browns</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure its a good product but its so fragile that shipping it might not be the best Idea.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d expect something a teeny bit better than that, even if most people will throw them away and use their own brushes.  </li>
            <li>When first getting this product, I was happy.</li>
            <li>I must say I love your palettes they are so suitable and affordable</li>
            <li>I love this product, and I love the color, it work the waiting,came just on time..</li>
            <li>I was pleased</li>
            <li>and I love the warmer shades.</li>
            <li>and they are ok    </li>
            <li>I have to say, I love the product.  </li>
            <li>This pallette has so many colors.</li>
            <li>I ordered this pallette and when I received it, I could not believe that I got this many colors in one set.</li>
            <li>the pallete has soo many colors.</li>
            <li>THe item was wrapped and safely shipped.</li>
            <li>IM GOING TO BUY SOME MORE FOR XMAS GIFTS :)</li>
            <li>I really love this pallette.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways, love this product.</li>
            <li>x 1 1/4\\&quot; (D), belies how many colors are tucked inside.  </li>
            <li>Most people tend to do this as they have their favorites.  </li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the product in reference to its price; however, I do have qualms with the way in which it was packaged for shipping.</li>
            <li>I really love the colors that come in this set.</li>
            <li>I just wish the mirror was more durable.</li>
            <li>The price is wonderful too!The only problem is deciding which colors to use.</li>
            <li>I wish the product had arrived in better condition.</li>
            <li>Already played around with different &amp;#34;looks&amp;#34; and am really happy with the results!  </li>
            <li>but Im really glad i bought it.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love, Shany products.</li>

            <li>I was so pleased as compartments kept opening up.</li>
            <li>The Make up pallette was cracked when they opened it and the top fell off.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>

            <li>and I&#x27;m so in love with it</li>
            <li>Maybe they r packaging better now.</li>
            <li>I like this product because it had so many colors and its way cheaper than buying stuff individuals.</li>
            <li>they are cute to wear it</li>
            <li>so it can travel safe</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I will buy more again.</li>
            <li>A gift she is really enjoying.</li>
            <li>I think the shadow colors blend lovely together without a ton of effort.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>Okay I said I wasn&#x27;t gong to knock the product for the mishap I had...</li>
            <li>4 stars :)</li>
            <li>I was very excited my husband bought me this and fell in love</li>
            <li>You can wear them along or layer to create your own unique</li>
            <li>the product&#x27;s quality is very good comes on and off nicely, blends well, neither too oily or dry</li>
            <li>my daughter loves this, the quality is good and the color last well and shows up good.  </li>
            <li>I love everything about their products they are awesome and a well quality product just like the over priced items from other companies.</li>
            <li>it does fit it&#x27;s name :) and</li>
            <li>There are so many colors and they are so smooth and go on easily.</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t any extremes here (no black), but rather a great variety for anyone to work with.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is a shimmer pallet I do wish the pallet included some matte colors but definitely not disappointed in my purchase</li>
            <li>Other than that, this is a beautiful makeup set and the colors are just the ones I&#x27;ve been wanting!</li>
            <li>This palette has so many fun colors!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get it off easily.</li>
            <li>soooooooo many colors to chose from, such great quality and in a way</li>
            <li>All said and done I am happy with the product and the only thing that would have made it better</li>
            <li>very pigmented ,has soft colors that are very beautiful ,this palete can be worn for days at work, proms,weddings even  </li>
            <li>it was easy</li>
            <li>However the box it comes in isn&#x27;t as strong of plastic as I would like to see.  </li>
            <li>good value and nice rich colors that actually show up on darker skin.</li>
            <li>Luckily they were able to find it.</li>
            <li>This really isn&#x27;t fitting for a MUA who is doing bridal makeup or anything of that nature, as the colors are quite bold and daring.  </li>
            <li>It is soft, an rich in pigment, I have used all kinds of make up, and i would compare this to the higher end cosmetic companies, love it, gonna get more!!</li>
            <li>and Im super excited to use this!</li>
            <li>There are a *lot* of colors here, which is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>it has a great range in colors and they last all day..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Grandma&#x27;s $0.02 - If you wear makeup every day and like to experiment with color, this is a fantastic set.  </li>
            <li>And its cheap.</li>
            <li>What I thought would turn in to a battle to get my stuff ended up being a smooth experience.</li>
            <li>They felt like silk and went on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and stayed on all day without wearing off.</li>
            <li>They are light too.</li>
            <li>i really enjoy using this product,it gives me a varity of chices in make up.</li>
            <li>They are cheap and upon lifting one up it decided to fall off of it&#x27;s stick.</li>
            <li>The Shany Professional Eyeshadow palette arrived in great condition at the right time.  </li>
            <li>The box is very pretty, and overall, the shades are beautiful.</li>
            <li>I do wish the red was a bit more bold, and if you are not one for shimmer colors this is not for you, most of the colors are shimmery, which I love!  </li>
            <li>They are nicely pigmented and the selection is quite generous, though more skewed toward neutral eyes (but great pinks and purples too), I especially like the big purple shadow.</li>
            <li>get creative ;)    3)</li>
            <li>RICH IN COLOR.</li>
            <li>totally :P</li>
            <li>The color is rich and well saturated.  </li>
            <li>This was a gift for my sister she love painting her face as I say, she really like it!</li>
            <li>and I was so excited about it, as soon as I opened the box the colors spreaded all over my clothes and seat.</li>
            <li>and it would definitely be fun for a Runway shoot!  </li>
            <li>Considering how many colors they packed into this baby, it is pretty compact.  </li>
            <li>It is fun and refreshing and I will definitely buy more of Shany&#x27;s shadows :)</li>
            <li>I was super excited when I saw it was delivered</li>
            <li>The colors are all very pigmented, true to color, and fabulous!</li>
            <li>I love it,very much now is one of my favor.</li>
            <li>and she really enjoys it--so many choices and experimenting to be done.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to purchase this product and experiment with the fun colors included.</li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>i have done different makeup looks with this pallet and each one has been very satisfying to the eye.</li>
            <li>It has alot of different colors and they are very pretty!!!</li>
            <li>which by my personal standards is pretty darn good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very professional product and the clients love the way it wares well.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t interested in!</li>
            <li>Will fit into any large purse when folded&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it everyday and the quality is great.</li>
            <li>and it was fun giving it as a gift.</li>
            <li>This palette is definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>So far pleased with purchase and used it couple of times</li>
            <li>this is worth your money.</li>
            <li>The fallout is minimal if at all, and it feels good on your skin.</li>
            <li>, just right.</li>
            <li>If you think the price is right, it is.  </li>
            <li>this isnt the right product for you.</li>
            <li>i was like my dad was right never buy makeup online.</li>
            <li>not really purse friendly though, but would fit into an overnight bag just fine in my opinion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and she was super happy with it colors last long and plenty to chose from</li>
            <li>Although I had to return the first one, this time they got it right</li>
            <li>I bought this item as a Deal of the Day thinking it would be cheap but perhaps contain a few nice colors.</li>
            <li>but....... one of the most amazing colors i loved about it is damaged :-(</li>
            <li>It was delivered very fast too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very nice palette for traveling, I also dropped it once (when open) and only one shadow broke.</li>
            <li>I liked the product very much, eyeshadows are of a very high quality and lasts for a very long time.</li>
            <li>im guessing they are starting to package it a lot better now.    </li>
            <li>I got exactly what was shown in all of the pictures from the supplier.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a palette on par quality range with some of the higher priced ones.  </li>
            <li>My eyeshadow applicators all ended up breaking within the first couples uses.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve seen kits like this for more than double this amount.  </li>
            <li>Would make a stunning gift for every teenage girl you know!</li>
            <li>First I was worried about the eyeshadows breaking</li>
            <li>Thanks shany!</li>
            <li>It said 162 colors the first time not 192</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re ordering a pressed powder make sure to give yourself enough time before the event, just in case!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bright and popping colors and a few neutrals</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, satisfied with the actual product!</li>
            <li>There is a great variety but very small containers.</li>
            <li>compared to most brands these eyeshadows have hardly any fall out which i love and is quite pigmented .</li>
            <li>I bought this for a teen who demands name brand only, and she loved it.</li>
            <li>Set with 2 Free Eye Shadow Brush and reusable case, SHANY Professional Eyeshadow Pallette, Runway Collection, 162 Colors, Shany Mineral Eye sparkle - Eyeshadow - Stack of 40 Favorite colors - USA Made,SHANY Masterpiece Signature Collection Brush Set - 24pcs Natural/Synthetic Bristle With Pouch, Storage &amp; Instruction - Limited Time Offer and SHANY Super Professional Brush Set with Leather Pouch, 32 Count, SHANY Cosmetics 3D</li>
            <li>i usually have problems getting colors to showup brightly even tho  </li>
            <li>Being a first time buyer i really did not know what to expect.</li>
            <li>I wish it had more mattes as all the shadows have a satin finish (although this can be more subtle for some, but still not matte).</li>
            <li>because something will happen to them for certain.</li>
            <li>The lid contains a large magnifying mirror and the set comes with 4 applicator brushes.  </li>
            <li>Great choices to choose from and compact enough to take up little space.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall my satisfaction is pretty high because despite my problems my supplier was very helpful and resolved the issue immediately.</li>
            <li>I still am, but not as much as I was before.</li>
            <li>It was packaged very well</li>
            <li>it was better than I expected.</li>
            <li>i was very surperized with the fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The real problem is that the quality of the eyeshadow is just acceptable.  </li>
            <li>I was like stunned, and I really wanted to try it.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>They are very temperamental.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered this around Christmas time for my sister who is really into makeup.</li>
            <li>I got really nervous and upset</li>
            <li>I really, really like this product.</li>
            <li>The price was great and none of the colors were broken or smeared.</li>
            <li>Very flattering taupe tones as well.</li>
            <li>thanks 👌</li>
            <li>looks really digging this Palette</li>
            <li>The brushes are very below par.  </li>
            <li>really.  </li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:mo1ZMAZY7BTWHBE]]If you are the experimental type and don&#x27;t like to have the same appearance whether you are at home, work, or at a party, you&#x27;re going to love the variety in this palette.  </li>
            <li>Once you open it, it will slide open so you can see a nice burst of color in front of you to experiment</li>
            <li>Now im using it every single day i highly recommend it. :)</li>
            <li>Long stay, easy to spread on eyes.</li>
            <li>OKAY I DONT KNOW ABOUT OTHER PPL</li>
            <li>Other than that, seems ok.</li>
            <li>The colors are a little sheerer than I expected for runway, but very good for office work, floresent lighting (give that natural look).</li>
            <li>Like colors are placed near each other and complimentary colors (love it)are near.</li>
            <li>They are actually more of a metallic/shimmer than I expected, but I LIKE that!!</li>
            <li>Other than that the color&#x27;s are amazing and last a long time, and are easy to get off.</li>
            <li>BUT WHY PAY MORE FOR LESS?</li>
            <li>I still love my choice, but next time have FRAGILE.</li>
            <li>The colors don&#x27;t look so vibrant either, however I have not tried them one because I&#x27;m giving this as a gift.</li>
            <li>only know it&#x27;s eyeshadow because of the title, but seems that this might be an issue with the quality that makes so many people have the same issue when it arrives??</li>
            <li>I am more into theatrical makeup but all of it is overpriced and regular makeup works well anyways.</li>
            <li>what the post office does is their problem and eventhough the box was damaged (obvious postal problem) not one shade of this beautiful set was damaged only one little scratch on the cover.</li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>If yours does come broken I really urge you to call and get a new one, because it&#x27;s a good deal</li>
            <li>All in all, if you are lucky enough to receive this product without much damage due to improper packing and all your brushes are intact (I also purchased their 13-piece brush set, so this aspect doesn&#x27;t bother me as much), then the product is well worth ordering.</li>
            <li>Too much trouble to return but seller could have done a better wrapping.</li>
            <li>Good product, but falsely advertised.</li>
            <li>I mean the color payoff is amazing</li>
            <li>It is just a waste of time and money, I am just lucky i called right away and am getting my refund.</li>
            <li>The levels of eyeshadow slide out smoothly, but I only found this out after trying to pry the box open.</li>
            <li>and they got back to very fast.</li>
            <li>Seemed like high quality and she loves it so far.</li>
            <li>some of the shadows are repeated &amp; one of the blue shadows broke during shipping and got blue pigment all over most of them... but simple dusting</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Looks exactly the same as the pictures.</li>
            <li>No, it&#x27;s not tiny, but it is pretty portable if you need to bring it somewhere...</li>
            <li>This product is nice, but a few of the shadows were broken, i think SHANY should package it better</li>
            <li>I got a new order and returned the old one (</li>
            <li>(experience says, dont pry open:), but I do like the hidden clamping.</li>
            <li>(it had a clear plastic insert over the blush wells).  </li>
            <li>mine completely shut anymore</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I have contacted the seller directly regarding this problem.  </li>
            <li>B0034XRY7W SHANY Professional Eyeshadow Pallette, Runway Collection]].  </li>
            <li>every conceivable color in the universe, is represented in this Shany Pallette.  </li>
            <li>but it came completely intact.  </li>
            <li>i am new to makeup so not sure what exactly to use what for yet wish it provided on what exactly was what.</li>
            <li>just rest it on the top and dont push down to hear the \\&quot;click\\&quot;    2) a bit loose.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find that the eye shadow is of a decent quality and there are numerous shades that I find are wearable.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t have to pay ANYTHING extra to return it and get a new one!</li>
            <li>So if youre looking for boldness and very colorful colors like a hot pink or neon green</li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical at first, but I LOVE this palette.  </li>
            <li>Indeed, one can argue that this was not an issue with the company itself -- minus the broken brush; however, if they were to better secure their product prior to shipping, as they do with their 6-color blush set, this would not be an issue.</li>
            <li>The other thing is that if you are interested in greens beyond the neutral range (khakis), this pallets doesn&#x27;t offer any.</li>
            <li>I also had ordered from Groupon and it was supposed to be delivered the same time as when this eyeshadow pallette was originally supposed to be received but was missing as well...</li>
            <li>then i expected but overall ill use it and its great for travel</li>
            <li>I cant review the actual product itself because I never made it that far.  </li>
            <li>The variety of colors is pretty solid, although there are some shades that are almost exactly the same and some shades that are missing entirely, so that could be tweaked.  </li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is that the pallette comes with A LOT of red shades, which just don&#x27;t match my skin tone and say more &amp;#34;I&#x27;m open for business&amp;#34; then &amp;#34;I work at a respected business.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I received this as a gift &amp; don&#x27;t normally do eye shadow from pallettes I got hooked on Shany loose powder</li>
            <li>One of the top color and one of the biggest blue color were broken.</li>
            <li>Okay, I admit, maybe I&#x27;m exaggerating a little teeny tiny little bit.</li>
            <li>and that turned out absolutely pristine due to the way it was packaged prior to shipping</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely suggest this to anyone wanting to try a whole slew of colors at once, and people just getting into makeup due to the variety.  </li>
            <li>This was supposed to be a Christmas gift for my wife, so I was excited when it arrived before Christmas only to be heart broken to see most of the colors were broken when she opened it Christmas morning.</li>
            <li>It was just a little bit, cuz I wanted to save it for when I really needed it.</li>

            <li> Very pleased with the product.  </li>

            <li> it has so many colors!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I love SHANY products!</li>
            <li> I really love the colors and the staying power they have!  </li>
            <li> THIS IS AN AMAZING PALETTE.  </li>
            <li> but everything else is amazing</li>
            <li> Omg didn&#x27;t think that this product was sooo amazing</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> An amazing eyeshadow palette.</li>
            <li> The quality is amazing for the price.</li>
            <li> I had purchased all my Christmas gifts online this year including this amazing eyeshadow pallette.</li>
            <li> i think 192 was an honest mistake the 9 and 6 were switched</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a 5 1/4\\&quot; x 5 3/4\\&quot; mirror inside the case that is quite handy.  </li>
            <li> There is a nice variety of color, and using the primer helps to ensure long-lasting coverage.  </li>
            <li> Packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> It folds up nicely when you&#x27;re not using it too.</li>
            <li> She liked it.  </li>
            <li> But to each her own I guess.</li>
            <li> I love it great colors and easy to apply</li>
            <li> The colors are wonderful but my package was completely botched!</li>
            <li> all that matters is that u got a set of shades, a good price and fine quality.</li>
            <li> I would have liked more greens, and maybe browns</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure its a good product but its so fragile that shipping it might not be the best Idea.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d expect something a teeny bit better than that, even if most people will throw them away and use their own brushes.  </li>
            <li> When first getting this product, I was happy.</li>
            <li> I must say I love your palettes they are so suitable and affordable</li>
            <li> I love this product, and I love the color, it work the waiting,came just on time..</li>
            <li> I was pleased</li>
            <li> and I love the warmer shades.</li>
            <li> and they are ok    </li>
            <li> I have to say, I love the product.  </li>
            <li> This pallette has so many colors.</li>
            <li> I ordered this pallette and when I received it, I could not believe that I got this many colors in one set.</li>
            <li> the pallete has soo many colors.</li>
            <li> THe item was wrapped and safely shipped.</li>
            <li> IM GOING TO BUY SOME MORE FOR XMAS GIFTS :)</li>
            <li> I really love this pallette.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways, love this product.</li>
            <li> x 1 1/4\\&quot; (D), belies how many colors are tucked inside.  </li>
            <li> Most people tend to do this as they have their favorites.  </li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the product in reference to its price; however, I do have qualms with the way in which it was packaged for shipping.</li>
            <li> I really love the colors that come in this set.</li>
            <li> I just wish the mirror was more durable.</li>
            <li> The price is wonderful too!The only problem is deciding which colors to use.</li>
            <li> I wish the product had arrived in better condition.</li>
            <li> Already played around with different &amp;#34;looks&amp;#34; and am really happy with the results!  </li>
            <li> but Im really glad i bought it.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love, Shany products.</li>

            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased as compartments kept opening up.</li>
            <li> The Make up pallette was cracked when they opened it and the top fell off.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> and she love it the colors and everything about it</li>

            <li> Maybe they r packaging better now.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it had so many colors and its way cheaper than buying stuff individuals.</li>
            <li> they are cute to wear it</li>
            <li> so it can travel safe</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I will buy more again.</li>
            <li> A gift she is really enjoying.</li>
            <li> I think the shadow colors blend lovely together without a ton of effort.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> Okay I said I wasn&#x27;t gong to knock the product for the mishap I had...</li>
            <li> 4 stars :)</li>
            <li> I was very excited my husband bought me this and fell in love</li>
            <li> You can wear them along or layer to create your own unique</li>
            <li> the product&#x27;s quality is very good comes on and off nicely, blends well, neither too oily or dry</li>
            <li> my daughter loves this, the quality is good and the color last well and shows up good.  </li>
            <li> I love everything about their products they are awesome and a well quality product just like the over priced items from other companies.</li>
            <li> it does fit it&#x27;s name :) and</li>
            <li> There are so many colors and they are so smooth and go on easily.</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t any extremes here (no black), but rather a great variety for anyone to work with.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is a shimmer pallet I do wish the pallet included some matte colors but definitely not disappointed in my purchase</li>
            <li> Other than that, this is a beautiful makeup set and the colors are just the ones I&#x27;ve been wanting!</li>
            <li> This palette has so many fun colors!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get it off easily.</li>
            <li> soooooooo many colors to chose from, such great quality and in a way</li>
            <li> All said and done I am happy with the product and the only thing that would have made it better</li>
            <li> very pigmented ,has soft colors that are very beautiful ,this palete can be worn for days at work, proms,weddings even  </li>
            <li> it was easy</li>
            <li> However the box it comes in isn&#x27;t as strong of plastic as I would like to see.  </li>
            <li> good value and nice rich colors that actually show up on darker skin.</li>
            <li> Luckily they were able to find it.</li>
            <li> This really isn&#x27;t fitting for a MUA who is doing bridal makeup or anything of that nature, as the colors are quite bold and daring.  </li>
            <li> It is soft, an rich in pigment, I have used all kinds of make up, and i would compare this to the higher end cosmetic companies, love it, gonna get more!!</li>
            <li> and Im super excited to use this!</li>
            <li> There are a *lot* of colors here, which is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> it has a great range in colors and they last all day..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Grandma&#x27;s $0.02 - If you wear makeup every day and like to experiment with color, this is a fantastic set.  </li>
            <li> And its cheap.</li>
            <li> What I thought would turn in to a battle to get my stuff ended up being a smooth experience.</li>
            <li> They felt like silk and went on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and stayed on all day without wearing off.</li>
            <li> They are light too.</li>
            <li> i really enjoy using this product,it gives me a varity of chices in make up.</li>
            <li> They are cheap and upon lifting one up it decided to fall off of it&#x27;s stick.</li>
            <li> The Shany Professional Eyeshadow palette arrived in great condition at the right time.  </li>
            <li> The box is very pretty, and overall, the shades are beautiful.</li>
            <li> I do wish the red was a bit more bold, and if you are not one for shimmer colors this is not for you, most of the colors are shimmery, which I love!  </li>
            <li> They are nicely pigmented and the selection is quite generous, though more skewed toward neutral eyes (but great pinks and purples too), I especially like the big purple shadow.</li>
            <li> get creative ;)    3)</li>
            <li> RICH IN COLOR.</li>
            <li> totally :P</li>
            <li> The color is rich and well saturated.  </li>
            <li> This was a gift for my sister she love painting her face as I say, she really like it!</li>
            <li> and I was so excited about it, as soon as I opened the box the colors spreaded all over my clothes and seat.</li>
            <li> and it would definitely be fun for a Runway shoot!  </li>
            <li> Considering how many colors they packed into this baby, it is pretty compact.  </li>
            <li> It is fun and refreshing and I will definitely buy more of Shany&#x27;s shadows :)</li>
            <li> I was super excited when I saw it was delivered</li>
            <li> The colors are all very pigmented, true to color, and fabulous!</li>
            <li> I love it,very much now is one of my favor.</li>
            <li> and she really enjoys it--so many choices and experimenting to be done.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to purchase this product and experiment with the fun colors included.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> i have done different makeup looks with this pallet and each one has been very satisfying to the eye.</li>
            <li> It has alot of different colors and they are very pretty!!!</li>
            <li> which by my personal standards is pretty darn good.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very professional product and the clients love the way it wares well.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t interested in!</li>
            <li> Will fit into any large purse when folded&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it everyday and the quality is great.</li>
            <li> and it was fun giving it as a gift.</li>
            <li> This palette is definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li> So far pleased with purchase and used it couple of times</li>
            <li> this is worth your money.</li>
            <li> The fallout is minimal if at all, and it feels good on your skin.</li>
            <li> , just right.</li>
            <li> If you think the price is right, it is.  </li>
            <li> this isnt the right product for you.</li>
            <li> i was like my dad was right never buy makeup online.</li>
            <li> not really purse friendly though, but would fit into an overnight bag just fine in my opinion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and she was super happy with it colors last long and plenty to chose from</li>
            <li> Although I had to return the first one, this time they got it right</li>
            <li> I bought this item as a Deal of the Day thinking it would be cheap but perhaps contain a few nice colors.</li>
            <li> but....... one of the most amazing colors i loved about it is damaged :-(</li>
            <li> It was delivered very fast too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice palette for traveling, I also dropped it once (when open) and only one shadow broke.</li>
            <li> I liked the product very much, eyeshadows are of a very high quality and lasts for a very long time.</li>
            <li> im guessing they are starting to package it a lot better now.    </li>
            <li> I got exactly what was shown in all of the pictures from the supplier.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a palette on par quality range with some of the higher priced ones.  </li>
            <li> My eyeshadow applicators all ended up breaking within the first couples uses.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen kits like this for more than double this amount.  </li>
            <li> Would make a stunning gift for every teenage girl you know!</li>
            <li> First I was worried about the eyeshadows breaking</li>
            <li> Thanks shany!</li>
            <li> It said 162 colors the first time not 192</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re ordering a pressed powder make sure to give yourself enough time before the event, just in case!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bright and popping colors and a few neutrals</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, satisfied with the actual product!</li>
            <li> There is a great variety but very small containers.</li>
            <li> compared to most brands these eyeshadows have hardly any fall out which i love and is quite pigmented .</li>
            <li> I bought this for a teen who demands name brand only, and she loved it.</li>

            <li> i usually have problems getting colors to showup brightly even tho  </li>
            <li> Being a first time buyer i really did not know what to expect.</li>
            <li> I wish it had more mattes as all the shadows have a satin finish (although this can be more subtle for some, but still not matte).</li>
            <li> because something will happen to them for certain.</li>
            <li> The lid contains a large magnifying mirror and the set comes with 4 applicator brushes.  </li>
            <li> Great choices to choose from and compact enough to take up little space.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall my satisfaction is pretty high because despite my problems my supplier was very helpful and resolved the issue immediately.</li>
            <li> I still am, but not as much as I was before.</li>
            <li> It was packaged very well</li>
            <li> it was better than I expected.</li>
            <li> i was very surperized with the fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The real problem is that the quality of the eyeshadow is just acceptable.  </li>
            <li> I was like stunned, and I really wanted to try it.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> They are very temperamental.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered this around Christmas time for my sister who is really into makeup.</li>
            <li> I got really nervous and upset</li>
            <li> I really, really like this product.</li>
            <li> The price was great and none of the colors were broken or smeared.</li>
            <li> Very flattering taupe tones as well.</li>
            <li> thanks 👌</li>
            <li> looks really digging this Palette</li>
            <li> The brushes are very below par.  </li>
            <li> really.  </li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1ZMAZY7BTWHBE]]If you are the experimental type and don&#x27;t like to have the same appearance whether you are at home, work, or at a party, you&#x27;re going to love the variety in this palette.  </li>
            <li> Once you open it, it will slide open so you can see a nice burst of color in front of you to experiment</li>
            <li> Now im using it every single day i highly recommend it. :)</li>
            <li> Long stay, easy to spread on eyes.</li>
            <li> OKAY I DONT KNOW ABOUT OTHER PPL</li>
            <li> Other than that, seems ok.</li>
            <li> The colors are a little sheerer than I expected for runway, but very good for office work, floresent lighting (give that natural look).</li>
            <li> Like colors are placed near each other and complimentary colors (love it)are near.</li>
            <li> They are actually more of a metallic/shimmer than I expected, but I LIKE that!!</li>
            <li> Other than that the color&#x27;s are amazing and last a long time, and are easy to get off.</li>
            <li> BUT WHY PAY MORE FOR LESS?</li>
            <li> I still love my choice, but next time have FRAGILE.</li>
            <li> The colors don&#x27;t look so vibrant either, however I have not tried them one because I&#x27;m giving this as a gift.</li>
            <li> only know it&#x27;s eyeshadow because of the title, but seems that this might be an issue with the quality that makes so many people have the same issue when it arrives??</li>
            <li> I am more into theatrical makeup but all of it is overpriced and regular makeup works well anyways.</li>
            <li> what the post office does is their problem and eventhough the box was damaged (obvious postal problem) not one shade of this beautiful set was damaged only one little scratch on the cover.</li>
            <li> highly recommended.</li>
            <li> If yours does come broken I really urge you to call and get a new one, because it&#x27;s a good deal</li>
            <li> All in all, if you are lucky enough to receive this product without much damage due to improper packing and all your brushes are intact (I also purchased their 13-piece brush set, so this aspect doesn&#x27;t bother me as much), then the product is well worth ordering.</li>
            <li> Too much trouble to return but seller could have done a better wrapping.</li>
            <li> Good product, but falsely advertised.</li>
            <li> I mean the color payoff is amazing</li>
            <li> It is just a waste of time and money, I am just lucky i called right away and am getting my refund.</li>
            <li> The levels of eyeshadow slide out smoothly, but I only found this out after trying to pry the box open.</li>
            <li> and they got back to very fast.</li>
            <li> Seemed like high quality and she loves it so far.</li>
            <li> some of the shadows are repeated &amp; one of the blue shadows broke during shipping and got blue pigment all over most of them... but simple dusting</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Looks exactly the same as the pictures.</li>
            <li> No, it&#x27;s not tiny, but it is pretty portable if you need to bring it somewhere...</li>
            <li> This product is nice, but a few of the shadows were broken, i think SHANY should package it better</li>
            <li> I got a new order and returned the old one (</li>
            <li> (experience says, dont pry open:), but I do like the hidden clamping.</li>
            <li> (it had a clear plastic insert over the blush wells).  </li>
            <li> mine completely shut anymore</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I have contacted the seller directly regarding this problem.  </li>
            <li> B0034XRY7W SHANY Professional Eyeshadow Pallette, Runway Collection]].  </li>
            <li> every conceivable color in the universe, is represented in this Shany Pallette.  </li>
            <li> but it came completely intact.  </li>
            <li> i am new to makeup so not sure what exactly to use what for yet wish it provided on what exactly was what.</li>
            <li> just rest it on the top and dont push down to hear the \\&quot;click\\&quot;    2) a bit loose.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find that the eye shadow is of a decent quality and there are numerous shades that I find are wearable.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have to pay ANYTHING extra to return it and get a new one!</li>
            <li> So if youre looking for boldness and very colorful colors like a hot pink or neon green</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first, but I LOVE this palette.  </li>
            <li> Indeed, one can argue that this was not an issue with the company itself -- minus the broken brush; however, if they were to better secure their product prior to shipping, as they do with their 6-color blush set, this would not be an issue.</li>
            <li> The other thing is that if you are interested in greens beyond the neutral range (khakis), this pallets doesn&#x27;t offer any.</li>
            <li> I also had ordered from Groupon and it was supposed to be delivered the same time as when this eyeshadow pallette was originally supposed to be received but was missing as well...</li>
            <li> then i expected but overall ill use it and its great for travel</li>
            <li> I cant review the actual product itself because I never made it that far.  </li>
            <li> The variety of colors is pretty solid, although there are some shades that are almost exactly the same and some shades that are missing entirely, so that could be tweaked.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the pallette comes with A LOT of red shades, which just don&#x27;t match my skin tone and say more &amp;#34;I&#x27;m open for business&amp;#34; then &amp;#34;I work at a respected business.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift &amp; don&#x27;t normally do eye shadow from pallettes I got hooked on Shany loose powder</li>
            <li> One of the top color and one of the biggest blue color were broken.</li>
            <li> Okay, I admit, maybe I&#x27;m exaggerating a little teeny tiny little bit.</li>
            <li> and that turned out absolutely pristine due to the way it was packaged prior to shipping</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely suggest this to anyone wanting to try a whole slew of colors at once, and people just getting into makeup due to the variety.  </li>
            <li> This was supposed to be a Christmas gift for my wife, so I was excited when it arrived before Christmas only to be heart broken to see most of the colors were broken when she opened it Christmas morning.</li>
            <li> It was just a little bit, cuz I wanted to save it for when I really needed it.</li>
            <li> The colors are very vibrant and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> At least half of the colors were broken, which I discovered as I opened the box and had makeup fly all over my face.</li>
            <li> I am so sad I can&#x27;t use it, because the colors looked beautiful but everything is all broken.</li>
            <li> LAST A LONG TIME.  </li>
            <li> When my product got here the side was cracked, which is pretty ridiculous as it was double boxed and wrapped in bubble wrap.  </li>
            <li> I suggested to my wife to vacuum the pink from the others to avoid color contamination as much as possible.</li>
            <li> At first it came totally messed up, the eyeshadows where all mixed and cracked and the lid was broken off.</li>
            <li> We received this product as promised, even a little early.  </li>
            <li> and then I finally finished cleaning it up on the outside, I opened it and it was an even bigger mess in the inside.</li>
            <li> They are the colors that I have been looking for and been wanting for a long time.</li>
            <li> Pink eyeshadow was all on the outside</li>
            <li> it just took too long to come</li>
            <li> One little color was broken and unusable - not that big of a deal - overall - worth the money.</li>
            <li> Another issue is that there is nothing between the layers to protect them from each other, so your colors will probably get a bit mixed up as time goes</li>
            <li> About 5.5 inches wide and 11 inches long, the three tier pallette pulls out from both sides to reveal 162 colors in every shade in the rainbow.</li>
            <li> This is simply loose pigment that is gathered on the edges somewhat like a dust.  </li>
            <li> Well i got it the other day, and it used to be 192 colors, but they changed the packaging, which sort of annoys me since i was hoping for 192 colors, and then when i get it the big green and the big blue ruined the whole bottom left palette, which makes me sad since it had all the orange&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> if i had to say anything is wrong with the product is that it is a little hard to open, other than that i love it !</li>
            <li> And if that wasn&#x27;t bad enought the top lid hinges broke after a week.</li>
            <li> witha fluff brush solved that ... it came shipped in layers of bubble wrap..</li>
            <li> This kit is made for the experimenter with a wide variety of shades.  </li>
            <li> is that when closed, it will pick up a bit of eyeshadow on the inside edges.  </li>
            <li> and I expected amazon and SHANY to be like</li>
            <li> a lil powder came off a couple colors, not much of a loss.</li>
            <li> It has a wide assortment of colors.</li>
            <li> One of the squares broke apart, and now all the shadows in the area are covered with the pink color.</li>
            <li> It is certainly not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was just mine or if other people had that problem, but just to let you know it is a possibility.</li>
            <li> I was expecting some extent of &#x27;wear&#x27; due to its having to be shipped through the mail; but, I also had them ship me a 6-color blush set</li>
            <li> Nail Art Decoration Mini Bottles with Nail Art Tweezer, 48 Count, plus other nail polish, nail art sets and brushes.</li>
            <li> OTHER THAN THAT</li>
            <li> i was skeptical at first because of my dark sink tone</li>
            <li> the box closes very tightly if ur nails are weak or nailpolish still not completely dry if u just paid a lot to get ur nails done just dont us them to open the lid!</li>
            <li> My fiance had to file down the tab with a nail file.</li>
            <li> I hope they did not rate down for this because that is probably something that happened during Transit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like to keep my makeup looking natural, nothing too dramatic</li>
            <li> /&gt;The case closes tightly to protect the palette, but don&#x27;t try to use your fingernail to pop it because it&#x27;s tight.  </li>
            <li> And I put on blush, little lipstick and a little eye shadow.</li>
            <li> I just tucked it under the lid of the latch and gave a little twist.  </li>
            <li> A little bit of a pain, but manageable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The palette is little powdery..</li>
            <li> When I got it ,it was a little damage and the makeup doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as others</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not knocking the product at all for that little mishap though as a whole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li> Her&#x27;s was a little tiny bit broken...</li>
            <li> Kit slides from slides to open and will be approximately 20 inches when opened</li>
            <li> and when I finally got it opened, I could see something had been broken.</li>
            <li> However when I got home my package was missing.</li>
            <li> I thought the quality of the eye shadow was poor as they did not last on her eyes.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, several colors were broken and make-up was spread all over the box.</li>
            <li> During shipping there was a few that where shattered, but thank god they where colors</li>
            <li> Pallets were broken mixed up making the kit unusable.  </li>
            <li> pallets were broken, returned for a 2nd</li>
            <li> The makeup stayed on all day and night with very little fallout.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This really isn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> I had order this product and had been waiting for it anxiously based on the reviwes.</li>
            <li> The only problem i had was that it was deliver to the wrong address because the delivery guy made a mistake.</li>
            <li> The closure to the box was very tough to get open and handle.</li>
            <li> It was such a mess as well as disappointing.</li>
            <li> I read reviews of people saying their colors were broken and the lid was broken off, and just my luck a brown and white one was broken along with the right side of the lid! :(</li>
            <li> Im very upset about it :(</li>
            <li> its very tight!</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow when applied is so shear that you can hardly see it.  </li>
            <li> The one complaint I have is that the trays do not slide well.  </li>
            <li> I had to call around and try to find my package that was 2 days late after the estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li> and it is common.  </li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed to find out that there is only 162(still a lot) colors and not 192, like they advertise.</li>
            <li> I received my order on time but half of the colors were shattered and broken!</li>
            <li> but they are all very shoddy.</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a Christmas gift for my sister and now I have to go through the hassle of returning the terrible quality product and stressing over whether this new one will come in acceptable shape AND be here in TIME for Christmas!!</li>
            <li> The bubble wrap is way too thin?</li>
            <li> However, upon the package&#x27;s arrival I discovered that it was broken beyond use.</li>
            <li> I am now addicted to all Shany products.</li>
            <li> One piece arrived broken and spreading into rest..</li>
            <li> The colors fell out and the mirror was broken off.</li>
            <li> n was a bit worried about getting broken</li>
            <li> , ordered another one and was even worse.  </li>
            <li> it was broken as well..</li>
            <li> All the Pallets were broken into pieces as soon as i got it</li>
            <li> The box came covered in shadow dust and when I opened it, I found where all the dust came from...about six of the shadows where broken and the dust was EVERYWHERE so the colors that weren&#x27;t broken were covered in the broken shadow.</li>
            <li> She has dramatic eyes and loves to play them up.  </li>
            <li> I have SHANY Cosmetics Mineral base Loose Pearl Eye Shadow Glitter/Eye Shadow 40pc</li>
            <li> im not too sad because i had already read the reviews and knew what i was expecting.</li>
            <li> so sad.</li>
            <li> lousy, given all deteriorated</li>
            <li> but with things like eyeshadow it does happen a lot unfortunately, so</li>
            <li> the sliding is a bit awkward.    </li>
            <li> I am so disappointed and angry! -_-</li>
            <li> and I must say we are disappointed with the quality of the product.  </li>
            <li> :(.</li>
            <li> a bit annoying</li>
            <li> i use a base on my eyes</li>
            <li> but i can use these colors with or without my base depending on the effect</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> I love this product, and I love the color, it work the waiting,came just on time.. I love it,very much now is one of my favor.</li>
            <li> Being a first time buyer i really did not know what to expect. But when I got my pallet I was pleased I mean the color payoff is amazing I love the fact that it is a shimmer pallet I do wish the pallet included some matte colors but definitely not disappointed in my purchase</li>
            <li> When first getting this product, I was happy. I still am, but not as much as I was before. There aren&#x27;t 192 colors in this palette. There&#x27;s 162 by my count. The levels of eyeshadow slide out smoothly, but I only found this out after trying to pry the box open. The closure to the box was very tough to get open and handle. I don&#x27;t know if it was just mine or if other people had that problem, but just to let you know it is a possibility. My fiance had to file down the tab with a nail file. The box is very pretty, and overall, the shades are beautiful. Good product, but falsely advertised.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PALLETE! I&#x27;ve been looking for a cheaper shadow that shows well on colored skin and this is it! There is a great variety but very small containers. But hey for this price, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> some of the shadows are repeated &amp; one of the blue shadows broke during shipping and got blue pigment all over most of them... but simple dusting witha fluff brush solved that ... it came shipped in layers of bubble wrap.. good value and nice rich colors that actually show up on darker skin.</li>
            <li> Pros:   1) It was packaged very well what the post office does is their problem and eventhough the box was damaged (obvious postal problem) not one shade of this beautiful set was damaged only one little scratch on the cover. im guessing they are starting to package it a lot better now.    2) the product&#x27;s quality is very good comes on and off nicely, blends well, neither too oily or dry, just right. colors are plenty and I love the warmer shades. get creative ;)    3) the box is very beautiful the shades slide aside one after another and they are ok    Cons:    1) the box closes very tightly if ur nails are weak or nailpolish still not completely dry if u just paid a lot to get ur nails done just dont us them to open the lid! because something will happen to them for certain. its very tight! a bit annoying but i dont close mine completely shut anymore just rest it on the top and dont push down to hear the \\&quot;click\\&quot;    2) a bit loose. the sliding is a bit awkward.    3) i think 192 was an honest mistake the 9 and 6 were switched im not too sad because i had already read the reviews and knew what i was expecting. its 162 colors. :) 162 beautiful good quality colors!     all in all at the end all that matters is that u got a set of shades, a good price and fine quality.</li>
            <li> Upon delivery, it was bubble wrapped,  However one of the bigger eyeshadows had broke inside, however it was a color I would never use, so I decided against sending it back to be replaced.  I have to say, I love the product.  It is soft, an rich in pigment, I have used all kinds of make up, and i would compare this to the higher end cosmetic companies, love it, gonna get more!!</li>
            <li> This pallette has so many colors. it was better than I expected. it has good color and I can say I will use all of them. highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I ordered this pallette and when I received it, I could not believe that I got this many colors in one set. very good colors and perfect quality.</li>
            <li> I Bought this as a Christmas Gift for my sister. She fell in love with all the bright colors and she was so Ecstatic! I Would Recommend this product to all makeup lovers!</li>
            <li> the pallete has soo many colors. i was very surperized with the fast shipping. THe item was wrapped and safely shipped. I had to contact shany since i was staying at a hotel at the time and they got back to very fast. The customer serivce manager actully called me and helped me out. 5/5 customer service.</li>
            <li> There are a *lot* of colors here, which is fantastic.  The variety of colors is pretty solid, although there are some shades that are almost exactly the same and some shades that are missing entirely, so that could be tweaked.  The real problem is that the quality of the eyeshadow is just acceptable.  Definitely use a primer with these.</li>
            <li> i got this product about a month ago. I LOVE IT !! it came in about 2 days and all the shadows were in great condition. it has a great range in colors and they last all day.. if i had to say anything is wrong with the product is that it is a little hard to open, other than that i love it !</li>
            <li> I liked the product very much, eyeshadows are of a very high quality and lasts for a very long time. colors are on any taste</li>
            <li> THIS IS AN AMAZING PALETTE.  RICH IN COLOR. GREAT PIGMENTS.  LAST A LONG TIME.  BEAUTIFUL COLORS.  GREAT PRODUCT FOR AN AMAZING PRICE.  IM GOING TO BUY SOME MORE FOR XMAS GIFTS :)</li>
            <li> Arrived perfectly. I&#x27;ve been using it everyday and the quality is great. All the colors have shimmer. They do not crease, they blend well and last all day.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I was very excited my husband bought me this and fell in love but....... one of the most amazing colors i loved about it is damaged :-( but everything else is amazing i am new to makeup so not sure what exactly to use what for yet wish it provided on what exactly was what.</li>
            <li> Well i got it the other day, and it used to be 192 colors, but they changed the packaging, which sort of annoys me since i was hoping for 192 colors, and then when i get it the big green and the big blue ruined the whole bottom left palette, which makes me sad since it had all the orange&#x27;s. Other than that the color&#x27;s are amazing and last a long time, and are easy to get off.</li>
            <li> The Shany Professional Eyeshadow palette arrived in great condition at the right time.  Great colors and it was fun giving it as a gift.</li>
            <li> Wow. This really isn&#x27;t that bad. I saved up enough money to buy this and I wear it almost ALL the time. Okay, I admit, maybe I&#x27;m exaggerating a little teeny tiny little bit. The thing is, 2 years ago, for my 10th birthday, I got this makeup set that was like pros. I was like stunned, and I really wanted to try it. So I did. And I put on blush, little lipstick and a little eye shadow. And it wasn&#x27;t a lot. It was just a little bit, cuz I wanted to save it for when I really needed it. Well, 10 minutes later, it started to itch. And itch. And sting. And sting. And it made my face red. I couldn&#x27;t get it off easily. So, when this didn&#x27;t itch or sting or make my face red, I was totally stoked.  Quality: 90%  Color:  99%  Lasting: 75%  Would I recommend it?  yeah totally :P</li>
            <li> I really love this pallette. I got exactly what was shown in all of the pictures from the supplier. The colors are very vibrant and a little goes a long way. I saw pictures from people who&#x27;s shadow was shattered. I hope they did not rate down for this because that is probably something that happened during Transit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, love this product. I will buy more from Shany!</li>
            <li> I agreed with Sky 07.  It happened to me that happened to this viewer.  One of the top color and one of the biggest blue color were broken. I do like the pigmentation of the colors. Too much trouble to return but seller could have done a better wrapping. The bubble wrap is way too thin?</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1ZMAZY7BTWHBE]]If you are the experimental type and don&#x27;t like to have the same appearance whether you are at home, work, or at a party, you&#x27;re going to love the variety in this palette.  If you think the price is right, it is.  The case, which is a compact 10 3/4\\&quot; (L) x 5 1/4\\&quot; (W) x 1 1/4\\&quot; (D), belies how many colors are tucked inside.  Once you open it, it will slide open so you can see a nice burst of color in front of you to experiment with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case closes tightly to protect the palette, but don&#x27;t try to use your fingernail to pop it because it&#x27;s tight.  Each time I wanted to open it I used something solid like an envelope opener or scissors.  I just tucked it under the lid of the latch and gave a little twist.  A little bit of a pain, but manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FEATURES:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;►  162 eyeshadow colors&lt;br /&gt;►  Kit slides from slides to open and will be approximately 20 inches when opened&lt;br /&gt;►  Similar size kits retail for over $100 in some department stores&lt;br /&gt;►  Will fit into any large purse when folded&lt;br /&gt;►  Day/Night colors Warm/Cool range both included&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are pigmented and a bit shimmery.  This kit is made for the experimenter with a wide variety of shades.  There aren&#x27;t any extremes here (no black), but rather a great variety for anyone to work with.  You can wear them along or layer to create your own unique look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a palette on par quality range with some of the higher priced ones.  The applicators can be replaced by ones of your choosing.  Most people tend to do this as they have their favorites.  There&#x27;s a 5 1/4\\&quot; x 5 3/4\\&quot; mirror inside the case that is quite handy.  When the layers of eyeshadow slide open, there&#x27;s sufficient room so the layers don&#x27;t hit one another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I noticed that you may wish to do is that when closed, it will pick up a bit of eyeshadow on the inside edges.  Wipe that off to prevent any mixing.  This is simply loose pigment that is gathered on the edges somewhat like a dust.  There&#x27;s not a lot, but wipe that off and give the mirror a swipe now and then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice value, and yes there are 162 colors (I counted).  If you like variety this may be a palette you&#x27;d like to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.d on the edges somewhat like a dust.

            <li> Although I had to return the first one, this time they got it right and I am happy about it.  thanks</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the product in reference to its price; however, I do have qualms with the way in which it was packaged for shipping. Upon receiving the product, about a third of the palettes were disheveled (a few to the point of being absolutely emptied) and one of the &#x27;brush&#x27; heads was detached from the body... Indeed, one can argue that this was not an issue with the company itself -- minus the broken brush; however, if they were to better secure their product prior to shipping, as they do with their 6-color blush set, this would not be an issue. I was expecting some extent of &#x27;wear&#x27; due to its having to be shipped through the mail; but, I also had them ship me a 6-color blush set and that turned out absolutely pristine due to the way it was packaged prior to shipping (it had a clear plastic insert over the blush wells).  All in all, if you are lucky enough to receive this product without much damage due to improper packing and all your brushes are intact (I also purchased their 13-piece brush set, so this aspect doesn&#x27;t bother me as much), then the product is well worth ordering.</li>
            <li> I really love the colors that come in this set. They are the colors that I have been looking for and been wanting for a long time. It&#x27;s a great variety and I can&#x27;t wait to try them on! I just wish the mirror was more durable. Mine ended up breaking while being delivered to me. My eyeshadow applicators all ended up breaking within the first couples uses. Other than that, this is a beautiful makeup set and the colors are just the ones I&#x27;ve been wanting!</li>
            <li> There are so many colors and they are so smooth and go on easily.The price is wonderful too!The only problem is deciding which colors to use.</li>
            <li> We received this product as promised, even a little early.  This was a birthday gift and I must say we are disappointed with the quality of the product.  The eyeshadow when applied is so shear that you can hardly see it.  It is certainly not what I expected.  I have contacted the seller directly regarding this problem.  Hopefully we can reach a resolution.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to purchase this product and experiment with the fun colors included. However, upon the package&#x27;s arrival I discovered that it was broken beyond use. At least half of the colors were broken, which I discovered as I opened the box and had makeup fly all over my face. I wish the product had arrived in better condition. I&#x27;m not going to be ordering anything like this off of amazon again.</li>
            <li> This palette is definitely worth the money.  The color is rich and well saturated.  I use eye primer before shadow application, and I know this helps make the color pop and last.  There is a nice variety of color, and using the primer helps to ensure long-lasting coverage.  The one complaint I have is that the trays do not slide well.  They are very temperamental.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen kits like this for more than double this amount.  It really is a good buy.</li>
            <li> I received a package from Shany Cosmetics last week that included this [[ASIN:B0034XRY7W SHANY Professional Eyeshadow Pallette, Runway Collection]].  About 5.5 inches wide and 11 inches long, the three tier pallette pulls out from both sides to reveal 162 colors in every shade in the rainbow. The lid contains a large magnifying mirror and the set comes with 4 applicator brushes.  The set arrived in great condition.  The colors give very good coverage and blend well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grandma&#x27;s $0.02 - If you wear makeup every day and like to experiment with color, this is a fantastic set.  Would make a stunning gift for every teenage girl you know!</li>
            <li> Wow! every conceivable color in the universe, is represented in this Shany Pallette.  Seems like a great buy as the quality looks really good.  Already played around with different &amp;#34;looks&amp;#34; and am really happy with the results!  A must buy!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my sister she love painting her face as I say, she really like it! it has so many colors!</li>
            <li> Omg didn&#x27;t think that this product was sooo amazing but Im really glad i bought it. Now im using it every single day i highly recommend it. :)</li>
            <li> My wife bought this as a gift for someone, she loves make-up she seem to like it when she opened it. That&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love, Shany products. I received this as a gift &amp; don&#x27;t normally do eye shadow from pallettes I got hooked on Shany loose powder but I must say that this eyeshadow is wonderful &amp; I am now addicted to all Shany products. I have purchased lots of their items &amp; received them as gifts as well and absolutely love them all. I have SHANY Cosmetics Mineral base Loose Pearl Eye Shadow Glitter/Eye Shadow 40pc Set with 2 Free Eye Shadow Brush and reusable case, SHANY Professional Eyeshadow Pallette, Runway Collection, 162 Colors, Shany Mineral Eye sparkle - Eyeshadow - Stack of 40 Favorite colors - USA Made,SHANY Masterpiece Signature Collection Brush Set - 24pcs Natural/Synthetic Bristle With Pouch, Storage &amp; Instruction - Limited Time Offer and SHANY Super Professional Brush Set with Leather Pouch, 32 Count, SHANY Cosmetics 3D Nail Art Decoration Mini Bottles with Nail Art Tweezer, 48 Count, plus other nail polish, nail art sets and brushes. I love everything about their products they are awesome and a well quality product just like the over priced items from other companies. I won&#x27;t use anything else except Shany. Thank you for making such wonderful products at a very fair price.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first, but I LOVE this palette.  The colors last all day and night.  I do wish the red was a bit more bold, and if you are not one for shimmer colors this is not for you, most of the colors are shimmery, which I love!  While there are a lot of colors, I felt they missed some, and over did others.  I would have liked more greens, and maybe browns (but you canfind those all over).</li>
            <li> OKAY I DONT KNOW ABOUT OTHER PPL BUT WHEN I GOT MINE THERE WERE NOT 192 COLORS THERE IS ONLY ABOUT 160 I KNOW IT DOESNT SEEM LIKE A BIG DIFFERENCE BUT WHY PAY MORE FOR LESS? OTHER THAN THAT I DO LIKE THE COLORS</li>
            <li> Well I have just received this and when I finally got it opened, I could see something had been broken. Pink eyeshadow was all on the outside and then I finally finished cleaning it up on the outside, I opened it and it was an even bigger mess in the inside. I still love my choice, but next time have FRAGILE. WROTE. ON THE OUTSIDE. NOT JUST INSIDE.</li>
            <li> these colors are absolutely beautiful...i love them i was skeptical at first because of my dark sink tone i usually have problems getting colors to showup brightly even tho  i use a base on my eyes but i can use these colors with or without my base depending on the effect i want i absolutely love SHANY eyeshadows....</li>
            <li> I like it and used almost a year</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing. First I was worried about the eyeshadows breaking but it came completely intact.  There is such a big variety in colors. I absolutely loved the shadows they aren&#x27;t think they look nice and have a glitter tone to some of them.</li>
            <li> i love it. its a bargin. soooooooo many colors to chose from, such great quality and in a way i technically dont ever need another eyeshadow. the veriety is  just so great.</li>
            <li> I just received this yesterday and havent used it yet but Im already happy with this product. I did swipe my finger against one of the colors to see how it would look on my skin and the pigments are great. Doing makeup for a fashion show next month and Im super excited to use this! Recommended</li>
            <li> I ordered this around Christmas time for my sister who is really into makeup.At first it came totally messed up, the eyeshadows where all mixed and cracked and the lid was broken off. I got a new order and returned the old one (for free, amazon sent me a bar code) and now it just came today.. in perfect condition. I am happy i reordered it because my sister LOVES it. If yours does come broken I really urge you to call and get a new one, because it&#x27;s a good deal and I didn&#x27;t have to pay ANYTHING extra to return it and get a new one!</li>
            <li> Amazed by the colors and placement. Long stay, easy to spread on eyes. The palette is little powdery.. One piece arrived broken and spreading into rest.. But given the powdery structure and reviews .. I think it is not possible to ship in intact .. So far pleased with purchase and used it couple of times</li>
            <li> purple broke. But that could have occur during shipping.</li>
            <li> When I got it ,it was a little damage and the makeup doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as others</li>
            <li> An amazing eyeshadow palette. I love it.</li>
            <li> This was a,\\&quot;because you are pretty\\&quot; gift from my husband. I was told the product came on time. Packaged nicely. Had to take a minute to see how the case opened (experience says, dont pry open:), but I do like the hidden clamping. I was so pleased as compartments kept opening up. Like colors are placed near each other and complimentary colors (love it)are near. The colors are a little sheerer than I expected for runway, but very good for office work, floresent lighting (give that natural look). All said and done I am happy with the product and the only thing that would have made it better is if they would have encluded a tube of eye shadow primer for longer wear.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for someone for christmas. The Make up pallette was cracked when they opened it and the top fell off.</li>
            <li> I reaally like this pallet..its a bit smaller then i expected but overall ill use it and its great for travel</li>
            <li> I was spectacle ordering from this company because I never heard of their product before.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it and I love it. And its cheap. The quality is amazing for the price. I would recommend this product to all my friends.</li>
            <li> llego roto, las sombras duran poco tiempo, se tardo una eternidad en llegar y a la final fue poco funcional</li>
            <li> I love it great colors and easy to apply</li>
            <li> I brought it as a gift and she love it the colors and everything about it she cant stop thanking me for it</li>
            <li> this is worth your money. it just took too long to come</li>
            <li> Looks great at our makeup bar in our day spa. It&#x27;s a very professional product and the clients love the way it wares well.</li>
            <li> very pigmented ,has soft colors that are very beautiful ,this palete can be worn for days at work, proms,weddings even  those days when you don&#x27;t feel like wearing makeup ,I suggest you should get this palette it does fit it&#x27;s name :) and shany cosmetics I must say I love your palettes they are so suitable and affordable</li>
            <li> I had purchased all my Christmas gifts online this year including this amazing eyeshadow pallette. I was super excited when I saw it was delivered and I couldn&#x27;t wait to see what it looked like! However when I got home my package was missing. I got really nervous and upset and I expected amazon and SHANY to be like well it&#x27;s not our fault... Well the next day I contacted amazon and told them that it said delivered but my merchandise wasn&#x27;t there. They IMMEDIATELY apologized for any inconveniences and even reshipped my product at NO COST to me and I even received it within a day! They didn&#x27;t question me or make me feel like I was hassling them. What I thought would turn in to a battle to get my stuff ended up being a smooth experience. I also had ordered from Groupon and it was supposed to be delivered the same time as when this eyeshadow pallette was originally supposed to be received but was missing as well... Lets just say I already emailed them 3 times with not response and called the post office and called Groupon today and nothing was resolved... Lets just say I will ONLY deal with Amazon for future purposed. AMAZON &amp; SHANY ROCK!</li>
            <li> I received my order on time but half of the colors were shattered and broken! This was purchased as a Christmas gift for my sister and now I have to go through the hassle of returning the terrible quality product and stressing over whether this new one will come in acceptable shape AND be here in TIME for Christmas!! I am so disappointed and angry! -_-</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my mother for christmas.  She loves it.  There are so many colors she can choose from.</li>
            <li> I received my order on time and in great condition.  The colors were perfect, but the best part were the textures.  They felt like silk and went on smoothly.</li>
            <li> This eyeshadow pallette is great. It came intact and none of the colors were messed up. I ordered it on the 9th of Feb and it arrived on the 13th. Goes on smoothly and stayed on all day without wearing off. I was a little disappointed to find out that there is only 162(still a lot) colors and not 192, like they advertise. With all that said, I would recommend it someone.</li>
            <li> I had order this product and had been waiting for it anxiously based on the reviwes. I love this product! It has alot of different colors and they are very pretty!!! They are light too. So if youre looking for boldness and very colorful colors like a hot pink or neon green this isnt the right product for you. I like to keep my makeup looking natural, nothing too dramatic so this was great for me. When i received it it was in great condition. all the colors in its section, nothing broken,etc. it had a lot of bubble wrap. The only problem i had was that it was deliver to the wrong address because the delivery guy made a mistake. I had to call around and try to find my package that was 2 days late after the estimated delivery date.Luckily they were able to find it.</li>
            <li> The colors are wonderful but my package was completely botched! The colors fell out and the mirror was broken off. 3 stars</li>
            <li> I really, really like this product. Looks exactly the same as the pictures. It was delivered very fast too. Would definitely buy their products again!</li>
            <li> I read reviews of people saying their colors were broken and the lid was broken off, and just my luck a brown and white one was broken along with the right side of the lid! :( so sad. The colors don&#x27;t look so vibrant either, however I have not tried them one because I&#x27;m giving this as a gift.</li>
            <li> I just received my pallete and I was so excited about it, as soon as I opened the box the colors spreaded all over my clothes and seat. I am so sad I can&#x27;t use it, because the colors looked beautiful but everything is all broken.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a teen who demands name brand only, and she loved it. The price was great and none of the colors were broken or smeared.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors! They are actually more of a metallic/shimmer than I expected, but I LIKE that!! Arrived in great condition. Very impressive pallette. Will be giving this one as a gift, but am considering buying another for myself! :)</li>
            <li> Great colors...love it!</li>
            <li> i really enjoy using this product,it gives me a varity of chices in make up. I love my eyeshadow i recomend this to anyone(:</li>
            <li> I got this palette for my daughter as a birthday gift and she just loves it.  It has about every color you could think of.  It folds up nicely when you&#x27;re not using it too.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my teenage daughter.  She liked it.  I thought the quality of the eye shadow was poor as they did not last on her eyes.  But It worked out great for her.</li>
            <li> my daughter loves this, the quality is good and the color last well and shows up good.  A good deal for the money</li>
            <li> This is the 1st item I ever bougth off amazon, it was perfect packaging, and the colors were perfect, just like in the picture</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product.  One little color was broken and unusable - not that big of a deal - overall - worth the money.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly. Unfortunately, several colors were broken and make-up was spread all over the box. The item looked as if it had been used to play volleyball with. Not an exaggeration. Very disappointed. Item was returned. Wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> Bought this item for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it.  It is the one that she uses pretty much everyday!  Lots of colors and stays on all day!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for our 20 something daughter for Christmas.  She has dramatic eyes and loves to play them up.  The colors are stunning in this collection.  I am sure she will be one happy girl this Christmas morning!  Sturdy packaging and came in mint condition.  Great gift for the &amp;#34;hard to shop for&amp;#34; girl or woman!</li>
            <li> this is a present for my sister, she loves doing make up and does everyone&#x27;s make up for parties, weddings, dances, everything under the sun!</li>
            <li> This was supposed to be a Christmas gift for my wife, so I was excited when it arrived before Christmas only to be heart broken to see most of the colors were broken when she opened it Christmas morning. She accepted it as is, saying she will use whats left, but I will never buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my daughter in law and she loves it!  She is a cosmetology student and does contests and has alot of colors to choose from.</li>
            <li> The box came covered in shadow dust and when I opened it, I found where all the dust came from...about six of the shadows where broken and the dust was EVERYWHERE so the colors that weren&#x27;t broken were covered in the broken shadow. It was such a mess as well as disappointing. And if that wasn&#x27;t bad enought the top lid hinges broke after a week.</li>
            <li> Back when I bought this (Dec 2010) it was advertised as 196 colors when, in fact, it was just 169. They are nicely pigmented and the selection is quite generous, though more skewed toward neutral eyes (but great pinks and purples too), I especially like the big purple shadow. It&#x27;s a very nice palette for traveling, I also dropped it once (when open) and only one shadow broke. Very flattering taupe tones as well. I wish it had more mattes as all the shadows have a satin finish (although this can be more subtle for some, but still not matte). The other thing is that if you are interested in greens beyond the neutral range (khakis), this pallets doesn&#x27;t offer any. It does carry a gorgeous teal shade, though. I would recommend this, it&#x27;s a good deal considering the variety and the quality you are getting.</li>
            <li> Love how there is so many colors. During shipping there was a few that where shattered, but thank god they where colors I wasn&#x27;t interested in!</li>
            <li> this product is actually really good. compared to most brands these eyeshadows have hardly any fall out which i love and is quite pigmented . i love it. As a makeup artist in training i would definitely recommend this product. i have done different makeup looks with this pallet and each one has been very satisfying to the eye.</li>
            <li> I got mines today and I&#x27;m so in love with it</li>
            <li> This eye shadow is excellent!!!. I read the reviews n was a bit worried about getting broken make up... but then my daughter ordered some n I tried it...n it stayed on all day!! Her&#x27;s was a little tiny bit broken...she just blew on it n a lil powder came off a couple colors, not much of a loss. So I ordered my own and it was completely perfect with no flaws! Maybe they r packaging better now. No complaints here...beautiful colors!!!!</li>
            <li> bought this for my gf and she was super happy with it colors last long and plenty to chose from</li>
            <li> I like this product because it had so many colors and its way cheaper than buying stuff individuals. Thanks shany!</li>
            <li> Great collection of eye colors  they are cute to wear it comes with a nice case and space saving great as a gift or for yourself</li>
            <li> My husband got this for me. It has a wide assortment of colors. Very good quality and well pigmented. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product is nice, but a few of the shadows were broken, i think SHANY should package it better so it can travel safe&lt;br /&gt;its good but i would not buy this again</li>
            <li> Theses colors are very bright, shiny and plentiful. Every colors of the rainbow is in this set there are blues, pinks, yellow, and etc.</li>
            <li> Everythin is good and the shipment in it best condition, thanks 👌</li>
            <li> I love this product. I will buy more again.</li>
            <li> One of the squares broke apart, and now all the shadows in the area are covered with the pink color. I suggested to my wife to vacuum the pink from the others to avoid color contamination as much as possible. Other than that, seems ok. Not a makeup artist, expert, and only know it&#x27;s eyeshadow because of the title, but seems that this might be an issue with the quality that makes so many people have the same issue when it arrives??</li>
            <li> lousy, given all deteriorated</li>
            <li> I bought it for someone&#x27;s birthday gift. But I got it broke. Im very upset about it :( :(. Not like as picture.&lt;br /&gt;I want to return this item.</li>
            <li> It said 162 colors the first time not 192, it was a typo. It&#x27;s a great product. I am more into theatrical makeup but all of it is overpriced and regular makeup works well anyways. I love SHANY products!</li>
            <li> When I recieved this item it was damage ask to replace it.  it was easy no question at all newitem shipped out no problem what so ever.  GREAT!!!!!! plus the product it a great item my daughter loved it.</li>
            <li> Seemed like high quality and she loves it so far. Lot of colors, brushes that seem well made. Buy it!</li>
            <li> I cant review the actual product itself because I never made it that far.  I got this for my girlfriend for christmas and upon opening the box we noticed and explosion of colors.  I&#x27;m talking literally looked like it exploded inside the box.  Pallets were broken mixed up making the kit unusable.  So Im like whatevs, ordered another one and was even worse.  I&#x27;m sure its a good product but its so fragile that shipping it might not be the best Idea.  Might want to just buy this in one in the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cliff note:  ordered 1.. pallets were broken, returned for a 2nd it was broken as well.. i give up.</li>
            <li> I bought this item as a Deal of the Day thinking it would be cheap but perhaps contain a few nice colors. I was surprised to find that the eye shadow is of a decent quality and there are numerous shades that I find are wearable. The only complaint I have is that the pallette comes with A LOT of red shades, which just don&#x27;t match my skin tone and say more &amp;#34;I&#x27;m open for business&amp;#34; then &amp;#34;I work at a respected business.&amp;#34; But to each her own I guess.</li>
            <li> A gift for my teenage Granddaughter and she really enjoys it--so many choices and experimenting to be done. A gift she is really enjoying.</li>
            <li> Got this as a birthday gift for a dear friend.  She loves it.  Great choices to choose from and compact enough to take up little space.</li>
            <li> All the Pallets were broken into pieces as soon as i got it i opened the box and boom there was powder even before i opened the makeup box once it was opened i was like my dad was right never buy makeup online. It is just a waste of time and money, I am just lucky i called right away and am getting my refund.</li>
            <li> I do want to address that I ordered my product off of amazon and had issues with receiving broke makeup, which is always a bummer when it happens...but with things like eyeshadow it does happen a lot unfortunately, so if you&#x27;re ordering a pressed powder make sure to give yourself enough time before the event, just in case!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not knocking the product at all for that little mishap though as a whole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall Review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall my satisfaction is pretty high because despite my problems my supplier was very helpful and resolved the issue immediately. I really love the colors and the staying power they have!  The fallout is minimal if at all, and it feels good on your skin. I&#x27;d definitely suggest this to anyone wanting to try a whole slew of colors at once, and people just getting into makeup due to the variety.  This really isn&#x27;t fitting for a MUA who is doing bridal makeup or anything of that nature, as the colors are quite bold and daring.  I can see someone who likes those looks really digging this Palette and it would definitely be fun for a Runway shoot!  It is fun and refreshing and I will definitely buy more of Shany&#x27;s shadows :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The colors are all very pigmented, true to color, and fabulous! I tried a look without a primer and it lasted about 6 hours before it started to fade, which by my personal standards is pretty darn good.  I am an eye rubber, I can&#x27;t help it...but despite that it still looked even and good without primer.&lt;br /&gt;2. With primer however was a dream!  The makeup stayed on all day and night with very little fallout.&lt;br /&gt;3. I think the shadow colors blend lovely together without a ton of effort.&lt;br /&gt;4. This palette has so many fun colors! Bright and popping colors and a few neutrals, you can do a LOT with this baby.&lt;br /&gt;5. Considering how many colors they packed into this baby, it is pretty compact.  No, it&#x27;s not tiny, but it is pretty portable if you need to bring it somewhere...not really purse friendly though, but would fit into an overnight bag just fine in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Packaging.  Okay I said I wasn&#x27;t gong to knock the product for the mishap I had...because it was eyeshadow and it is common.  However the box it comes in isn&#x27;t as strong of plastic as I would like to see.  When my product got here the side was cracked, which is pretty ridiculous as it was double boxed and wrapped in bubble wrap.  I think Shany could definitely improve their packaging.  Another issue is that there is nothing between the layers to protect them from each other, so your colors will probably get a bit mixed up as time goes on.&lt;br /&gt;2. The brushes are very below par.  I know they&#x27;re just a couple spongy things and I wasn&#x27;t expecting excellence, but...really.  They are cheap and upon lifting one up it decided to fall off of it&#x27;s stick. I thought it was a fluke but they are all very shoddy. I&#x27;d expect something a teeny bit better than that, even if most people will throw them away and use their own brushes.  I figured I could use them when friends came over and dispose of them afterwards, but nope, not going to happen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, satisfied with the actual product! 4 stars :)</li>
