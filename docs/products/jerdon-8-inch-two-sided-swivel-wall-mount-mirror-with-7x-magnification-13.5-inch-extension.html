            <li>After staying at a nice hotel which had a bathroom mirror that swiveled toward you and allowed me to put on my eye make-up without glasses, I was determined to find one for our own bathroom.  </li>
            <li>The installation was very easy and included everything needed and it looks great in our recently remodeled bath - works great too!</li>

            <li>and i love this handy mirror that i installed.  </li>
            <li>After receiving the mirror and installing it on the wall (5 minutes), my wife liked it better than the one at Westin.   </li>
            <li>Amazon was by far the best price.  </li>
            <li>Perfect size - I can easily see my whole face.  </li>

            <li>This is a great mirror for seeing really up close!</li>
            <li>At first I thought I would need a lighted mirror, but I positioned it by my mirror and the lighting is great.  </li>
            <li>Very important to those whose eyesight is no longer 20/20.</li>
            <li>Easy installation, nice quality look and feel.</li>
            <li>Love this mirror.  </li>

            <li>and I love the extension arm.  </li>

            <li>My husband has installed this produce and we love it.  </li>
            <li>Saw this mirror in Westin Orlando Hotel and love it.</li>
            <li>Amazon needs better quality control.</li>
            <li>We just hoped the shipping package was a bit more sturdy to keep it from breaking in transit (not that our was damaged) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;</li>
            <li>and I love how it swivels in and out.</li>
            <li>I would be extremely pleased with this product except that is has an ineffective mounting system.  </li>
            <li>You will love this item.</li>
            <li>It seems to be well made and is very attractive with my current decor.  </li>

            <li>It was easy to install</li>
            <li>Seems well made, easy to hang.</li>
            <li>My husband, who is good with this kind of stuff, followed the instructions and the mirror, when folded back against the wall, looked like it was slanted.</li>
            <li>I experienced some eye strain because of it, but nothing major.</li>
            <li>Love this mirror can quickly and was you as describe.&lt;br /&gt;Match</li>

            <li>This mirror fit the requirements, so I bought it.    </li>
            <li>She needed a place with light and a movable mirror.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look cheap, but it doesn&#x27;t look or feel like a high-end item either.  </li>
            <li>I just wish it came with a light.</li>
            <li>Make sure you hang it at the right height for you.  </li>
            <li>This should be a very rare, just check yours when you unpack it.</li>

            <li>The magnification shows more than you really want to see!</li>
            <li>This mirror is perfect for my small bathroom.</li>
            <li>At my last place I bought the \\&quot;Wall Mount Scissors Extension Arm 5X Magnifying Mirror\\&quot; which I liked MUCH better.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone -- got my old mirror off my counter and the size and magnification is great!!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and the installation was so easy!</li>
            <li>The quality is overall good, though it shows some bumps on a dot, as if it is not evenly mirrored.  </li>
            <li>Nice finish and classy looking.</li>
            <li>So much that I ordered more for family members.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s cute and very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Very pleased to discover the quality of the mirror, it was better than I expected.</li>
            <li>The two sides allow good vision at regular and magnification levels and adjust at lots of angles to get the right light.</li>
            <li>Installation was pretty easy.</li>
            <li>Needed to put something in the bathroom to fill two holes that were there and the mirrow fit perfectly, plus it matched the new towel bar and the magnification was perfect for such a blind person as myself.  </li>
            <li>I first used this product in a hotel and decided I wanted one for my own use and mainly for my contact lens and shaving.</li>
            <li>it is great for those close up views of stray hairs and other imperfections.</li>
            <li>other than that very nice.</li>
            <li>My third time was about a five minute installation - wife has been very pleased each and every time.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to put up and very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to find this product because it was exactly what I had been looking for.</li>
            <li>Thanks again Amazon!!</li>
            <li>First to take off the factory stickers and clean the mirror.</li>
            <li>If I had designed it myself, I would have made the swing arm a little longer so that it would come away from the wall farther, but it is a great mirror.  </li>
            <li>But i&#x27;m sure the product would work perfectly fine for someone who isn&#x27;t trying to match a specific wall mount!</li>
            <li>I had to wait for the handyman to originally install it just right in the first place.</li>
            <li>She said that she didn&#x27;t realize how much she would enjoy the magnification for putting on her eye make-up etc...</li>
            <li>Like I said, the mirror is nice, but is definitely does not have a brass or gold tone of any sort to it.</li>
            <li>The design is elegant and simple and I discovered how necessary a good magnifying mirror is, which is on the reverse side.</li>
            <li>Like the powerful magnification, have not noticed any distortion</li>
            <li>It swings out nice and back up against the wall when your done.  </li>
            <li>And I love the clear magnification.</li>
            <li>just the right magnification for what I need.  </li>
            <li>We have it mounted on just wallboard right now and hope it stays in place.</li>
            <li>The Magnification on this product met my needs andwas just right.  </li>
            <li>I screwed it right into a stud using an electric screwdriver</li>
            <li>OK, so nothing a few washer can&#x27;t fix, although it is a hassle to have to take it off again and search for suitable washers to fix an engineering problem with the product.</li>
            <li>I ordered Jerdon first class 7x wall mount mirror as I liked the style of the swing arm and double sided mirror that magnified and a choice of nichol, chrome or gold.     </li>
            <li>Still a great product overall, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>easy to hang and pretty clear for 7x magnification.</li>
            <li>and so far it is holding up fine.</li>
            <li>This is a first class product.</li>
            <li>I first saw one of these in a hotel.</li>
            <li>, i took the measure while i was wearing hills, that was silly, but we reinstall it, now is perfect</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll last forever.</li>
            <li>Only problem was the wife deciding where to mount it, and of course where it was mounted is not the correct place. :-)</li>
            <li>This is a well made item, exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I do believe I paid more for it back in 2007 than what Amazon has it listed for.  </li>
            <li>My wife had to have one, or one like it, so, the Jerdon First Class 7X seemed to fill the bill.  </li>
            <li>I first saw one of these mirrors in a hotel and knew it was a \\&quot;must have\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>My only concern is after using this 7x magnifying compared to a 5x, I found that I like the 5x better.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Most mirrors are only 5X.</li>
            <li>I have seen similar standing mirrors in department stores selling for much more.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>First a washer fell out..</li>
            <li>This mirror is exactly what we wanted in our bathroom.  </li>
            <li>This was perfect, not too expensive and exactly what the doctor ordered.  </li>
            <li>By design, you&#x27;re going to be moving and pulling on this thing a lot, and you need to have a good, firm attachment to the wall.  </li>
            <li>Much nicer than the cheap one I nearly bought at Ikea.</li>
            <li>It has a little extra detail that makes it look classy and decorative and the nickel finish matches her bathroom perfectly.  </li>
            <li>This is good for a guest or kids bathroom, but if you&#x27;re upgrading your master bath, you really should look at a more expensive, solidly-built mirror.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This mirror seems high quality and should last, I was able to hang this myself in about fifteen minutes.  </li>
            <li>The arm is easy to maneuver to swing out to your face and then back to the wall again.</li>
            <li>The assembly and mounting was very simple and easy to understand, and the mirror is sturdily made and doesn&#x27;t wobble.</li>
            <li>postioning it with my large bathroom mirror.</li>
            <li>After a certain age you have additional hair growth on your face, ears, and nose that you did not have before.</li>
            <li>It easily moves around so you can view the whole back of the head.</li>
            <li>It is better than what i was expecting, i use it every day, my husband didn&#x27;t like at the begining, he said he could see every single detail in his face, but i have discovered him using it, haha, i recomended it.</li>
            <li>Its much cheaper than those found at large retailers like Bed Bath and Beyond.</li>
            <li>Some of us call it the Ugly Stick because you will see all your flaws in this great mirror.  :-)  </li>
            <li>My only suggestion would be to consider the model with the light.  </li>
            <li>Jerdon really needs to address this.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just what I needed at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I returned from my vacation and knew immediately I needed to find one fast.  </li>
            <li>This is either a production or design defect, but for this price, I expected something more sturdy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not fancy but sturdy, well made and priced very competitively.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I had looked all over for a reasonably priced magnifying mirror for my updated bathroom.  </li>
            <li>The magnifying really helps my husband when he is shaving.  </li>
            <li>so you see your whole face.</li>
            <li>If you are boomers like we are, you really need one of these mirrors.  </li>
            <li>It is even better than I expected.</li>
            <li>This one mounts on the wall very conveniently</li>
            <li>Would recommend this for anyone looking for a wall mounted mirror at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Glad I spent the extra few dollars and got a very nice mirror.</li>
            <li>So, it is getting more use than I expected!</li>
            <li>My husband installed it for me, and when I tried to extend the arm, the whole bracket moved because the mounting bracket bolts are too long for the nut to securely anchor the product.</li>
            <li>After a few months, it will pay for itself because now I can see well enough to tweeze my own eyebrows!</li>
            <li>swivels nicely and fits well in my small bath.  </li>
            <li>Also, like another reviewer, the screws that secure the mirror to its wall mounting plate are about 3/16\\&quot; TOO LONG... and they are metric!  </li>
            <li>This mirror really exposes your new flaws.</li>
            <li>Wish the decorate beading was on the regular mirror side and not the magnified side, since I use the regular mirror more often.</li>
            <li>As I get older my eyesite isn&#x27;t what it used to be so</li>
            <li>Love the mirror, the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because I did have to use different screws to attach it to the wall; the hardware provided was not sufficient.</li>
            <li>Looks very classy!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommended it if you don&#x27;t mind screwing it into your bathroom wall.</li>
            <li>High quality product.</li>
            <li>Just pick a stud where the mirror, when folded flat, will fit in a desirable location - also make sure the arms will be &amp;#34;level&amp;#34; when it is folded away (so be extra careful when mounting the backing plate to ensure this leveling).  </li>
            <li>The magnifying is enough to see all of your facial hairs you are trying to pluck easily.</li>
            <li>I mounted it right next to the medicine cabinet</li>
            <li>Had to adjust the rotating tension on the extender joints to turn more easily so not to rip the wall out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been on the wall for a couple of years now and the finish still looks new.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t care about this new growth, or don&#x27;t want to know don&#x27;t buy this mirror.</li>
            <li>If your area doesn&#x27;t have side lighting, only overhead lighting like mine, you might appreciate the extra light.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t be able to miss any of those pesky little chin hairs ever again!</li>
            <li>I have gotten to where I cannot see very clearly without my glasses and this fills the bill.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time an obviously returned item was sold as new.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I originally bought one from HOme Depot, but it was cheesy, very flimsy and cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>I installed this easily by myself in a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how long I lived without this mirror in my daily life, I really love it &amp; use it daily!!</li>
            <li>Being wall mounted, it can be easily pushed back out of the way, plus, you have the option of the regular mirror on the opposite side.  </li>
            <li>Well, under one of the stickers is a LARGE, DEEP scratch in the mirror.</li>
            <li>would definitely recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s eyes are getting older faster than the rest of the body!</li>
            <li>The mirrors easily turn over from regular to extreme magnification.</li>
            <li>, just crystal clear views.  </li>
            <li>Clearly, the old one was an 3x, not an 5x as I had feared.</li>
            <li>So, that fixed I try again.</li>
            <li>am a frequent Amazon customer.  </li>
            <li>My mom (68 yrs old) discovered that she has a mole on her eyelid that she had never seen before.</li>
            <li>but it was old .I</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m in my early 60&#x27;s, I need a magnified makeup mirror.  </li>
            <li>It was a bummer because the wall mount didn&#x27;t match my mom&#x27;s old wall mount.</li>
            <li>I have always mounted these directly to a wall stud, so acquiring a stud finder is a recommended tool before you get started.  </li>
            <li>Super Saver shipping &#x3D; SUPER SLOW!   </li>
            <li>I hardly even use the 7x magnification side because the other side is close enough to me that I can see to do my hair and makeup (also great for eyebrow tweezing).  </li>
            <li>too low 10x is too high.  </li>
            <li>Be careful about putting it near open windows since it can and will reflect sun light which potentially could cause a fire.</li>
            <li>Having looked through all of the stores, I finally found exactly what I needed here at Amazon; a simple wall mounted adjustable mirror to put my hair up in back using both hands and still see what I was doing.</li>
            <li>It is not terrible, just a little annoying, but overall I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>The manufacturers need to make it CLEAR, that  following the template is not enough.</li>
            <li>I held the base against the wall while my wife extended the mirror &amp; when she had it in the perfect position I marked drill holes and had it installed in less than five minutes.</li>
            <li>The arms were a bit stiff at first, but after some use they loosened up.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s &#x27;eyes have aged&#x27; but they still like to put eye makeup on!</li>
            <li>This wall mounted brushed nickel finish makeup mirror matches back very well to other brushed nickel pieces in our remodeled bathroom.</li>
            <li>The mirror show very clear I&#x27;m just not use to the other side which is a magnifying  class.  </li>

            <li> It looks nice but is not&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Nice mirror lacks ability to move vertically.</li>
            <li> I used my own achors to mount in drywall.</li>
            <li> After staying in a nice hotel in San Antonio that had one of these mirrors in the bathroom, my wife just had to have one.</li>
            <li> May be nice lamps, but I&#x27;ll never know.</li>
            <li> Nice mirror.  </li>
            <li> It is slim and fits nicely against the wall.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with the quality and feel that it was an extremely good buy.</li>
            <li> Nice quality mirror.  </li>
            <li> After staying at a nice hotel which had a bathroom mirror that swiveled toward you and allowed me to put on my eye make-up without glasses, I was determined to find one for our own bathroom.  </li>
            <li> The installation was very easy and included everything needed and it looks great in our recently remodeled bath - works great too!</li>
            <li> It is a bit on the light weight side but works well and looks very nice.</li>
            <li> Great mirror and works really well, good quality and looks it.  </li>
            <li> A well made product and very easy to mount on the wall.</li>
            <li> Very easy to install.  </li>
            <li> great  quality, nice to pull magnifying mirror right up to your face.  </li>
            <li> and I found many varieties that I liked.  </li>
            <li> and i love this handy mirror that i installed.  </li>
            <li> After receiving the mirror and installing it on the wall (5 minutes), my wife liked it better than the one at Westin.   </li>
            <li> Amazon was by far the best price.  </li>
            <li> Perfect size - I can easily see my whole face.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re lucky that I&#x27;m handy!  </li>
            <li> This is a great mirror for seeing really up close!</li>
            <li> At first I thought I would need a lighted mirror, but I positioned it by my mirror and the lighting is great.  </li>
            <li> Very important to those whose eyesight is no longer 20/20.</li>
            <li> Easy installation, nice quality look and feel.</li>
            <li> Love this mirror.  </li>
            <li> Love these wall mount shaving/makeup mirrors.</li>
            <li> , I purchased this mirror to help me see better when applying my make-up.  </li>
            <li> Recently had the use of one of these mirrors in a wonderful hotel and found this one through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I guess you could get a more substantial mirror</li>
            <li> I use it many times every day.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this.  </li>
            <li> and I love the extension arm.  </li>
            <li> But I love it and can&#x27;t shave or trim without it.</li>
            <li> My husband has installed this produce and we love it.  </li>
            <li> Saw this mirror in Westin Orlando Hotel and love it.</li>
            <li> Amazon needs better quality control.</li>
            <li> We just hoped the shipping package was a bit more sturdy to keep it from breaking in transit (not that our was damaged) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;</li>
            <li> and I love how it swivels in and out.</li>
            <li> I would be extremely pleased with this product except that is has an ineffective mounting system.  </li>
            <li> You will love this item.</li>

            <li> Couldn&#x27;t have been a better buy.  </li>
            <li> Which it does reference in the description, however I was expecting a more goldfish hue</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a magnifying mirror that would attach to the wall and be able to be extended from the wall.  </li>

            <li> Very nice styling and very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> This mirror is especially nice because it folds flat against the wall and out of the way when you don&#x27;t need it.  </li>
            <li> I first used this mirror in a hotel in NYC, and I loved it.  </li>
            <li> Finish and mirrors are not flawed in any way and look good.    </li>
            <li> it matches the other hardware great and it was very easy to install!</li>
            <li> It looks very nice in our new bathroom.   </li>
            <li> I PURCHASED THIS ITEM FROM AMAZON AND RETURNED IT, THE LIGHT UP VERSION IS ALOT MORE HELPFUL.......</li>
            <li> Make sure you really want to see your face, ladies!!!</li>
            <li> easy to install</li>

            <li> It also was so easy to install, but we have to do it twice</li>
            <li> It easily moves out of my way when it&#x27;s not in use</li>
            <li> Unit easily mounted on wall.</li>
            <li> It attached to the wall easily and performs just like I wanted.  </li>

            <li> This is well made and easy to install.</li>
            <li> It is sturdy, mounts easily  </li>
            <li> She is extremely happy - the mirror is sturdy and the magnification is more than enough.</li>
            <li> Great quality and better price than inferior products at the local building supply stores.</li>
            <li> Easy to install</li>
            <li> It was easy to install</li>
            <li> Seems well made, easy to hang.</li>
            <li> My husband, who is good with this kind of stuff, followed the instructions and the mirror, when folded back against the wall, looked like it was slanted.</li>
            <li> I experienced some eye strain because of it, but nothing major.</li>
            <li> Love this mirror can quickly and was you as describe.&lt;br /&gt;Match</li>
            <li> Easy to mount and very useful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy and very pretty with the edging!  </li>
            <li> It attaches securely to you wall</li>
            <li> The mirror articulates smoothly and holds its position well.</li>
            <li> This mirror fit the requirements, so I bought it.    </li>
            <li> She needed a place with light and a movable mirror.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look cheap, but it doesn&#x27;t look or feel like a high-end item either.  </li>
            <li> I just wish it came with a light.</li>
            <li> Make sure you hang it at the right height for you.  </li>
            <li> This should be a very rare, just check yours when you unpack it.</li>
            <li> Easy to mount,looks good and folds out of the way nice and tight.</li>
            <li> The magnification shows more than you really want to see!</li>
            <li> This mirror is perfect for my small bathroom.</li>
            <li> At my last place I bought the \\&quot;Wall Mount Scissors Extension Arm 5X Magnifying Mirror\\&quot; which I liked MUCH better.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone -- got my old mirror off my counter and the size and magnification is great!!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and the installation was so easy!</li>
            <li> The quality is overall good, though it shows some bumps on a dot, as if it is not evenly mirrored.  </li>
            <li> Nice finish and classy looking.</li>
            <li> So much that I ordered more for family members.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s cute and very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Very pleased to discover the quality of the mirror, it was better than I expected.</li>
            <li> The two sides allow good vision at regular and magnification levels and adjust at lots of angles to get the right light.</li>
            <li> Installation was pretty easy.</li>
            <li> Needed to put something in the bathroom to fill two holes that were there and the mirrow fit perfectly, plus it matched the new towel bar and the magnification was perfect for such a blind person as myself.  </li>
            <li> I first used this product in a hotel and decided I wanted one for my own use and mainly for my contact lens and shaving.</li>
            <li> it is great for those close up views of stray hairs and other imperfections.</li>
            <li> other than that very nice.</li>
            <li> My third time was about a five minute installation - wife has been very pleased each and every time.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to put up and very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to find this product because it was exactly what I had been looking for.</li>
            <li> Thanks again Amazon!!</li>
            <li> First to take off the factory stickers and clean the mirror.</li>
            <li> If I had designed it myself, I would have made the swing arm a little longer so that it would come away from the wall farther, but it is a great mirror.  </li>
            <li> But i&#x27;m sure the product would work perfectly fine for someone who isn&#x27;t trying to match a specific wall mount!</li>
            <li> I had to wait for the handyman to originally install it just right in the first place.</li>
            <li> She said that she didn&#x27;t realize how much she would enjoy the magnification for putting on her eye make-up etc...</li>
            <li> Like I said, the mirror is nice, but is definitely does not have a brass or gold tone of any sort to it.</li>
            <li> The design is elegant and simple and I discovered how necessary a good magnifying mirror is, which is on the reverse side.</li>
            <li> Like the powerful magnification, have not noticed any distortion</li>
            <li> It swings out nice and back up against the wall when your done.  </li>
            <li> And I love the clear magnification.</li>
            <li> just the right magnification for what I need.  </li>
            <li> We have it mounted on just wallboard right now and hope it stays in place.</li>
            <li> The Magnification on this product met my needs andwas just right.  </li>
            <li> I screwed it right into a stud using an electric screwdriver</li>
            <li> OK, so nothing a few washer can&#x27;t fix, although it is a hassle to have to take it off again and search for suitable washers to fix an engineering problem with the product.</li>
            <li> I ordered Jerdon first class 7x wall mount mirror as I liked the style of the swing arm and double sided mirror that magnified and a choice of nichol, chrome or gold.     </li>
            <li> Still a great product overall, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> easy to hang and pretty clear for 7x magnification.</li>
            <li> and so far it is holding up fine.</li>
            <li> This is a first class product.</li>
            <li> I first saw one of these in a hotel.</li>
            <li> , i took the measure while i was wearing hills, that was silly, but we reinstall it, now is perfect</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll last forever.</li>
            <li> Only problem was the wife deciding where to mount it, and of course where it was mounted is not the correct place. :-)</li>
            <li> This is a well made item, exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> I do believe I paid more for it back in 2007 than what Amazon has it listed for.  </li>
            <li> My wife had to have one, or one like it, so, the Jerdon First Class 7X seemed to fill the bill.  </li>
            <li> I first saw one of these mirrors in a hotel and knew it was a \\&quot;must have\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> My only concern is after using this 7x magnifying compared to a 5x, I found that I like the 5x better.  </li>
            <li> It is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Most mirrors are only 5X.</li>
            <li> I have seen similar standing mirrors in department stores selling for much more.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> First a washer fell out..</li>
            <li> This mirror is exactly what we wanted in our bathroom.  </li>
            <li> This was perfect, not too expensive and exactly what the doctor ordered.  </li>
            <li> By design, you&#x27;re going to be moving and pulling on this thing a lot, and you need to have a good, firm attachment to the wall.  </li>
            <li> Much nicer than the cheap one I nearly bought at Ikea.</li>
            <li> It has a little extra detail that makes it look classy and decorative and the nickel finish matches her bathroom perfectly.  </li>
            <li> This is good for a guest or kids bathroom, but if you&#x27;re upgrading your master bath, you really should look at a more expensive, solidly-built mirror.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This mirror seems high quality and should last, I was able to hang this myself in about fifteen minutes.  </li>
            <li> The arm is easy to maneuver to swing out to your face and then back to the wall again.</li>
            <li> The assembly and mounting was very simple and easy to understand, and the mirror is sturdily made and doesn&#x27;t wobble.</li>
            <li> postioning it with my large bathroom mirror.</li>
            <li> After a certain age you have additional hair growth on your face, ears, and nose that you did not have before.</li>
            <li> It easily moves around so you can view the whole back of the head.</li>
            <li> It is better than what i was expecting, i use it every day, my husband didn&#x27;t like at the begining, he said he could see every single detail in his face, but i have discovered him using it, haha, i recomended it.</li>
            <li> Its much cheaper than those found at large retailers like Bed Bath and Beyond.</li>
            <li> Some of us call it the Ugly Stick because you will see all your flaws in this great mirror.  :-)  </li>
            <li> My only suggestion would be to consider the model with the light.  </li>
            <li> Jerdon really needs to address this.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I needed at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I returned from my vacation and knew immediately I needed to find one fast.  </li>
            <li> This is either a production or design defect, but for this price, I expected something more sturdy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not fancy but sturdy, well made and priced very competitively.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I had looked all over for a reasonably priced magnifying mirror for my updated bathroom.  </li>
            <li> The magnifying really helps my husband when he is shaving.  </li>
            <li> so you see your whole face.</li>
            <li> If you are boomers like we are, you really need one of these mirrors.  </li>
            <li> It is even better than I expected.</li>
            <li> This one mounts on the wall very conveniently</li>
            <li> Would recommend this for anyone looking for a wall mounted mirror at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Glad I spent the extra few dollars and got a very nice mirror.</li>
            <li> So, it is getting more use than I expected!</li>
            <li> My husband installed it for me, and when I tried to extend the arm, the whole bracket moved because the mounting bracket bolts are too long for the nut to securely anchor the product.</li>
            <li> After a few months, it will pay for itself because now I can see well enough to tweeze my own eyebrows!</li>
            <li> swivels nicely and fits well in my small bath.  </li>
            <li> Also, like another reviewer, the screws that secure the mirror to its wall mounting plate are about 3/16\\&quot; TOO LONG... and they are metric!  </li>
            <li> This mirror really exposes your new flaws.</li>
            <li> Wish the decorate beading was on the regular mirror side and not the magnified side, since I use the regular mirror more often.</li>
            <li> As I get older my eyesite isn&#x27;t what it used to be so</li>
            <li> Love the mirror, the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because I did have to use different screws to attach it to the wall; the hardware provided was not sufficient.</li>
            <li> Looks very classy!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommended it if you don&#x27;t mind screwing it into your bathroom wall.</li>
            <li> High quality product.</li>
            <li> Just pick a stud where the mirror, when folded flat, will fit in a desirable location - also make sure the arms will be &amp;#34;level&amp;#34; when it is folded away (so be extra careful when mounting the backing plate to ensure this leveling).  </li>
            <li> The magnifying is enough to see all of your facial hairs you are trying to pluck easily.</li>
            <li> I mounted it right next to the medicine cabinet</li>
            <li> Had to adjust the rotating tension on the extender joints to turn more easily so not to rip the wall out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been on the wall for a couple of years now and the finish still looks new.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t care about this new growth, or don&#x27;t want to know don&#x27;t buy this mirror.</li>
            <li> If your area doesn&#x27;t have side lighting, only overhead lighting like mine, you might appreciate the extra light.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be able to miss any of those pesky little chin hairs ever again!</li>
            <li> I have gotten to where I cannot see very clearly without my glasses and this fills the bill.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time an obviously returned item was sold as new.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I originally bought one from HOme Depot, but it was cheesy, very flimsy and cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> I installed this easily by myself in a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how long I lived without this mirror in my daily life, I really love it &amp; use it daily!!</li>
            <li> Being wall mounted, it can be easily pushed back out of the way, plus, you have the option of the regular mirror on the opposite side.  </li>
            <li> Well, under one of the stickers is a LARGE, DEEP scratch in the mirror.</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s eyes are getting older faster than the rest of the body!</li>
            <li> The mirrors easily turn over from regular to extreme magnification.</li>
            <li> , just crystal clear views.  </li>
            <li> Clearly, the old one was an 3x, not an 5x as I had feared.</li>
            <li> So, that fixed I try again.</li>
            <li> am a frequent Amazon customer.  </li>
            <li> My mom (68 yrs old) discovered that she has a mole on her eyelid that she had never seen before.</li>
            <li> but it was old .I</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m in my early 60&#x27;s, I need a magnified makeup mirror.  </li>
            <li> It was a bummer because the wall mount didn&#x27;t match my mom&#x27;s old wall mount.</li>
            <li> I have always mounted these directly to a wall stud, so acquiring a stud finder is a recommended tool before you get started.  </li>
            <li> Super Saver shipping &#x3D; SUPER SLOW!   </li>
            <li> I hardly even use the 7x magnification side because the other side is close enough to me that I can see to do my hair and makeup (also great for eyebrow tweezing).  </li>
            <li> too low 10x is too high.  </li>
            <li> Be careful about putting it near open windows since it can and will reflect sun light which potentially could cause a fire.</li>
            <li> Having looked through all of the stores, I finally found exactly what I needed here at Amazon; a simple wall mounted adjustable mirror to put my hair up in back using both hands and still see what I was doing.</li>
            <li> It is not terrible, just a little annoying, but overall I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The manufacturers need to make it CLEAR, that  following the template is not enough.</li>
            <li> I held the base against the wall while my wife extended the mirror &amp; when she had it in the perfect position I marked drill holes and had it installed in less than five minutes.</li>
            <li> The arms were a bit stiff at first, but after some use they loosened up.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s &#x27;eyes have aged&#x27; but they still like to put eye makeup on!</li>
            <li> This wall mounted brushed nickel finish makeup mirror matches back very well to other brushed nickel pieces in our remodeled bathroom.</li>
            <li> The mirror show very clear I&#x27;m just not use to the other side which is a magnifying  class.  </li>
            <li> The only negative I found was that the joints on the swivel arms are stiff and require more effort to open and close than I would expect.  </li>
            <li> Images are clear and sharp, and the arm extends and stays in place for as long as I need it to.  </li>
            <li> and it lays flat against the wall when not in use.</li>
            <li> I was expecting to have to hang a typical chrome finish mirror but was pleasantly surprised to see this nickel finish.</li>
            <li> I saw this same mirror several other places.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I lived so long without one.  </li>
            <li> The hardware it comes with is NOT sufficient for \\&quot;dry wall\\&quot; sheathed walls.  </li>
            <li> a side note, when installing a wall mirror, you should either screw it straight into a stud, or buy some serious wall anchors.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t remember what the magnification was on the mirror that has been in my bathroom for the past nearly 8 years, so got this one -- 7x -- just in case.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this to anyone needing a little extra help seeing!!</li>
            <li> Wish mirror was a little larger.</li>
            <li> it is all that I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> Just not the quality I expected.</li>
            <li> I Installed this mirror in our bathroom a few years ago after we stayed at a hotel with a similar model.</li>
            <li> So took longer than I expected to arrive</li>
            <li> After reading reviews, I threw out the included screws and used real drywall mounts that unclip behind the wall.  </li>
            <li> This was everything that I expected.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback is that the extension arm is very tight in one direction.</li>
            <li> not good quality but enough quality to last</li>
            <li> It is extremely practical with the moving arm and oscillating mirror.  </li>
            <li> The mounting plate is slightly curved, and (2) the attached mounting screws are slightly too long.  </li>
            <li> but you would have to pay at least double the price.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is how it fastens to the wall.</li>
            <li> Too frustrated now to take the thing down to ship back, I will leave it up but am very dissatisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Still going strong, although the base attached to the wall does slightly jiggle due to the weight of the mirror when extended.  </li>
            <li> We even put WD40 on it in hopes of loosening it up, but to no avail - they are still tight.  </li>
            <li> I looked all over to find this little gem.</li>
            <li> The arms were a little stiff, but they adjust to make them less stiff with a turn of the screw.  </li>
            <li> Use it everyday for shaving, wife uses it for makeup.</li>
            <li> I went to a few stores looking for one that could work for me.  </li>
            <li> As you can guess I was not happy that I had to return back to store for a refund.      </li>
            <li> Not cheap.</li>
            <li> When you wear glasses, trying to do your hair or makeup using a regular mirror in front of the sink is not great</li>
            <li> Having done that, now the return time has played out and I am left with a broken item.</li>
            <li> If you want them to ship out of the warehouse within a few days you will need to pay!</li>
            <li> No problems, just hard to find it to order it.</li>
            <li> Always throw away the little plastic anchors that ship with any product like this, they are useless and are guaranteed to fail, sooner if not later.</li>
            <li> This unit is lightweight, with thin, hollow tubes and a hollow stamped base.  </li>
            <li> This means I cannot tighten the nut down enough so that the base is flush to the wall, and the base of the mirror will rattle loosely whenever the mirror is moved.  </li>
            <li> The outer edge was broken off which allowed it to slip through the bushing, making it wobble.</li>
            <li> The package arrived as promised with all the instructions and nothing broken.</li>
            <li> Broken within a week.</li>
            <li> But the swing part is broken.</li>
            <li> It does the job, but the hinges were poorly designed so the mirror is difficult to move.  </li>
            <li> If you are using it to apply makeup you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> You cant go wrong with this mirror.  </li>
            <li> it stinks to wear glasses</li>
            <li> Quality is a bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> and I can see things that you usually don&#x27;t want to!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought a mirror and was disappointed that it broke during the mounting process.  </li>
            <li> Two problems: (1)</li>

            <li> Scary!!!!! Make sure you really want to see your face, ladies!!! I couldn&#x27;t remember what the magnification was on the mirror that has been in my bathroom for the past nearly 8 years, so got this one -- 7x -- just in case. Clearly, the old one was an 3x, not an 5x as I had feared. You won&#x27;t be able to miss any of those pesky little chin hairs ever again! Of course, you won&#x27;t be able to miss the crow&#x27;s feet, either!!!</li>
            <li> Love this mirror.  The finish is very nice and extends perfectly out.  Wish the decorate beading was on the regular mirror side and not the magnified side, since I use the regular mirror more often.</li>
            <li> A well made product and very easy to mount on the wall. I am very happy with the quality for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> just the right magnification for what I need.  swivels nicely and fits well in my small bath.  easy to install</li>
            <li> This mirror is a of good quality. I have my vanity next to my walk in shower so this mirror is exposed to all the moisture of the shower as well. It has held up well. I would be lost without it.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with the mirrow. I ordered it for a gift and they were very pleased with the mirror. I would recommend the wall Mout mirrow to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a brushed nickel finished mirror and this one fit the bill perfectly.  It works as intended and for the $$ it is a great buy.  I recommend it to anyone looking for a magnifying mirror</li>
            <li> This wall mount 7X mirror is wonderful!  For those who need help in seeing up close, this is great.  Being wall mounted, it can be easily pushed back out of the way, plus, you have the option of the regular mirror on the opposite side.  It&#x27;s great for hands-free use!  My only suggestion would be to consider the model with the light.  If your area doesn&#x27;t have side lighting, only overhead lighting like mine, you might appreciate the extra light.</li>
            <li> Love these wall mount shaving/makeup mirrors. Easy installation, nice quality look and feel. Looks great in the bathroom. Use it everyday for shaving, wife uses it for makeup.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice mirror for the price. The satin nickel finish matches our bathroom faucet and towel racks perfectly.</li>
            <li> As I get older my eyesite isn&#x27;t what it used to be so, I purchased this mirror to help me see better when applying my make-up.  The mirror works great - just like I wanted and hoped it would.  It was easy to put on the wall.  The arms were a little stiff, but they adjust to make them less stiff with a turn of the screw.  Very happy I bought this mirror.</li>
            <li> A very welcome addition to my vanity.  Ensures that I don&#x27;t leave the house looking like a clown.  Very important to those whose eyesight is no longer 20/20.</li>
            <li> Recently had the use of one of these mirrors in a wonderful hotel and found this one through Amazon.  Just as good a product and I can see things that you usually don&#x27;t want to!!!!</li>
            <li> What a great product.   It looks very nice in our new bathroom.   We use it every day.   Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Super Saver shipping &#x3D; SUPER SLOW!   If you want them to ship out of the warehouse within a few days you will need to pay!</li>
            <li> Lov it  easy to hang.  7x. Is the way to go  5x  too low 10x is too high.  It came in two days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this mirror for 6 months now and I hate it.  It does the job, but the hinges were poorly designed so the mirror is difficult to move.  At my last place I bought the \\&quot;Wall Mount Scissors Extension Arm 5X Magnifying Mirror\\&quot; which I liked MUCH better.</li>
            <li> This mirror is a great mirror for the price. It is a bit on the light weight side but works well and looks very nice. I guess you could get a more substantial mirror but you would have to pay at least double the price.</li>
            <li> This is a first class product. it is all that I expected it to be. very easy to mount on bathroom wall and a really great space saver. I would recommend this to anyone thinking of purchasing a similar product.</li>
            <li> I first saw one of these in a hotel. I like the ideal,so I got this for the home.It does help when shaving.You don&#x27;t miss spots,anymore. I guess it would help for putting on makeup,too.</li>
            <li> It is extremely practical with the moving arm and oscillating mirror.  I use it many times every day. The quality is overall good, though it shows some bumps on a dot, as if it is not evenly mirrored.  I am very happy to have it.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this a 5 star rating is because it is only a 7x mirror.  If it were 10x I would give it 5 stars.  This mirror is wonderful!  I can now see while putting on my eye makeup and when tweezing my brows.  It folds back and out of the way neatly against the wall.  Good purchase for the price!</li>
            <li> I was excited to find this product because it was exactly what I had been looking for. My husband installed it for me, and when I tried to extend the arm, the whole bracket moved because the mounting bracket bolts are too long for the nut to securely anchor the product. OK, so nothing a few washer can&#x27;t fix, although it is a hassle to have to take it off again and search for suitable washers to fix an engineering problem with the product. So, that fixed I try again. First to take off the factory stickers and clean the mirror. Well, under one of the stickers is a LARGE, DEEP scratch in the mirror. Too frustrated now to take the thing down to ship back, I will leave it up but am very dissatisfied with the purchase. I only gave it two stars because it IS what I wanted. Just not the quality I expected.</li>
            <li> I use this daily and like the quality and the appearance.  It&#x27;s ideal for makeup application.</li>
            <li> I first used this product in a hotel and decided I wanted one for my own use and mainly for my contact lens and shaving.</li>
            <li> Not only does this mirror provide great image clarification but also has wonderful styling. Looks very classy!</li>
            <li> This is a great mirror for seeing really up close! It&#x27;s great for putting in contact lenses &amp; anything else that needs \\&quot;close up\\&quot; work. Very useful!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this.  I have gotten to where I cannot see very clearly without my glasses and this fills the bill.  It attaches securely to you wall and I love the extension arm.  I can use it to do my hair, makeup, etc. postioning it with my large bathroom mirror.</li>
            <li> well, if you don&#x27;t like the way you look, you will not like this. it is great for those close up views of stray hairs and other imperfections. But I love it and can&#x27;t shave or trim without it. my wife has one as well and loves it for putting on makeup. good style and finish. easy installation</li>
            <li> I needed magnification after cataract surgery. This mirror fit the bill perfectly and was easy to install.</li>
            <li> The quality of this mirror is really good.  I had to get better/ different wall anchor hardware.  The hardware it comes with is NOT sufficient for \\&quot;dry wall\\&quot; sheathed walls.  Also, like another reviewer, the screws that secure the mirror to its wall mounting plate are about 3/16\\&quot; TOO LONG... and they are metric!  Jerdon really needs to address this.  They&#x27;re lucky that I&#x27;m handy!  Had to adjust the rotating tension on the extender joints to turn more easily so not to rip the wall out.  Would I buy another?  YES, but I will be prepared with hardware next time.</li>
            <li> Made her happy, that&#x27;s what counts</li>
            <li> My husband has installed this produce and we love it.  The mirror show very clear I&#x27;m just not use to the other side which is a magnifying  class.  Great product.  Saw this mirror in Westin Orlando Hotel and love it.</li>
            <li> Item was re-packed - it must have been returned by another customer.  Item was as described.&lt;br /&gt;I am a frequent Amazon customer.  This is the first time an obviously returned item was sold as new.&lt;br /&gt;I did not want to bother with shipping the item back.  Amazon needs better quality control.</li>
            <li> Good sturdy and good looking/quality product.  We just hoped the shipping package was a bit more sturdy to keep it from breaking in transit (not that our was damaged) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;good product!</li>
            <li> I PURCHASED THIS ITEM FROM AMAZON AND RETURNED IT, THE LIGHT UP VERSION IS ALOT MORE HELPFUL.......</li>
            <li> It is better than what i was expecting, i use it every day, my husband didn&#x27;t like at the begining, he said he could see every single detail in his face, but i have discovered him using it, haha, i recomended it. It also was so easy to install, but we have to do it twice, i took the measure while i was wearing hills, that was silly, but we reinstall it, now is perfect</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I needed at a reasonable price. The two sides allow good vision at regular and magnification levels and adjust at lots of angles to get the right light. No problems, just hard to find it to order it.</li>
            <li> I was on vacation in Mexico and the resort I was staying at had this wall mount mirror that I loved.  I returned from my vacation and knew immediately I needed to find one fast.  I went to a few stores looking for one that could work for me.  I bought a mirror and was disappointed that it broke during the mounting process.  As you can guess I was not happy that I had to return back to store for a refund.      This time I checked out Amazon.com&#x27;s website and I found many varieties that I liked.  I ordered Jerdon first class 7x wall mount mirror as I liked the style of the swing arm and double sided mirror that magnified and a choice of nichol, chrome or gold.     I can&#x27;t believe how long I lived without this mirror in my daily life, I really love it &amp; use it daily!! It easily moves out of my way when it&#x27;s not in use and it&#x27;s not cluttering any counter space. I highly recommend this product and the installation was so easy!</li>
            <li> this mirror is a god-send.  I can see to put on makeup, do my eyebrows, etc. without having to break my back leaning over the vanity.  Images are clear and sharp, and the arm extends and stays in place for as long as I need it to.  would definitely recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s eyes are getting older faster than the rest of the body!</li>
            <li> not good quality but enough quality to last</li>
            <li> My wife loves this mirror! I Installed this mirror in our bathroom a few years ago after we stayed at a hotel with a similar model. Our bathroom is in FL, which means this mirror lives in constant humidity. It&#x27;s been on the wall for a couple of years now and the finish still looks new. The mirror articulates smoothly and holds its position well. Installation was pretty easy.</li>
            <li> The mirror is just what I was looking for and I love how it swivels in and out. My only complaint is how it fastens to the wall. Both of the screws on the sides could not fasten into a stud, only 1 could. We have it mounted on just wallboard right now and hope it stays in place.</li>
            <li> I would be extremely pleased with this product except that is has an ineffective mounting system.  Two problems: (1) The mounting plate is slightly curved, and (2) the attached mounting screws are slightly too long.  This means I cannot tighten the nut down enough so that the base is flush to the wall, and the base of the mirror will rattle loosely whenever the mirror is moved.  This is either a production or design defect, but for this price, I expected something more sturdy.</li>
            <li> This two-sided mirror was just what I was looking for.  It&#x27;s not fancy but sturdy, well made and priced very competitively.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife and she loves it, so do I.  The quality is very good with one exception, The screw/nut that connects the swing arm on my unit was defective. The outer edge was broken off which allowed it to slip through the bushing, making it wobble. This should be a very rare, just check yours when you unpack it. You will love this item.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical when I saw how inexpensive this mirror was compared to many others.  However, it is a great product!  The installation was very easy and included everything needed and it looks great in our recently remodeled bath - works great too!</li>
            <li> I used one of these mirrors in a swanky hotel and just had to have one for the home.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money, but I wanted an attractive piece of decor for the bathroom.  This mirror fit the requirements, so I bought it.    It is absolutely wonderful!  It seems to be well made and is very attractive with my current decor.  If I had designed it myself, I would have made the swing arm a little longer so that it would come away from the wall farther, but it is a great mirror.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a surprise for my wife as part of a bath remodel. It looks nice but is not&lt;br /&gt; the best quality, it is a bit chesp. Ok for the price i guesscheap</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t have been a better buy.  She needed a place with light and a movable mirror.  This does a great job.  Thanks</li>
            <li> The mirror is of good quality and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll last forever. Nice finish and classy looking. Not cheap. My only problem with it is that it showed up on Amazon&#x27;s search under &#x27;brass&#x27;  or &#x27;gold tone&#x27; mirrors. And it is not. It is brushed aluminum. Which it does reference in the description, however I was expecting a more goldfish hue since that is what I had searched for on the site. Like I said, the mirror is nice, but is definitely does not have a brass or gold tone of any sort to it. That is the only reason I deducted one star.</li>
            <li> I first used this mirror in a hotel in NYC, and I loved it.  It&#x27;s great for makeup, and my husband loves it for shaving as well.    You can&#x27;t beat the price either.   A great find!</li>
            <li> Needed to put something in the bathroom to fill two holes that were there and the mirrow fit perfectly, plus it matched the new towel bar and the magnification was perfect for such a blind person as myself.  Great buy.</li>
            <li> Very nice looking. the magnification is great!  I thought I needed a 10X But the 7X is perfect.  If you are using it to apply makeup you can&#x27;t go wrong. I don&#x27;t think it was Amazon prime eligible.  So took longer than I expected to arrive but I guess I&#x27;m used to getting things from Amazon prime within two days.</li>
            <li> Have used this product now for 5 months. Had a mirror with no magnification that I did not like.  The Magnification on this product met my needs andwas just right.  Unit easily mounted on wall.</li>
            <li> No complaints...mounting was a snap and it works great. Finish and mirrors are not flawed in any way and look good.    Only problem was the wife deciding where to mount it, and of course where it was mounted is not the correct place. :-)</li>
            <li> I had looked all over for a reasonably priced magnifying mirror for my updated bathroom.  I needed brushed nickel and a wall mount.  This product fit the bill perfectly.  I LOVE IT.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This mirror is almost too good! The magnification shows more than you really want to see! Easy to mount,looks good and folds out of the way nice and tight. Very glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> I recently bought two wall mirrors, this swing-out unit, and a more expensive scissors-arm unit.  The more expensive (about $110) unit is sturdy, hefty, and appears to be solid cast brass.  This unit is lightweight, with thin, hollow tubes and a hollow stamped base.  It doesn&#x27;t look cheap, but it doesn&#x27;t look or feel like a high-end item either.  This is good for a guest or kids bathroom, but if you&#x27;re upgrading your master bath, you really should look at a more expensive, solidly-built mirror.&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, when installing a wall mirror, you should either screw it straight into a stud, or buy some serious wall anchors.  By design, you&#x27;re going to be moving and pulling on this thing a lot, and you need to have a good, firm attachment to the wall.  Always throw away the little plastic anchors that ship with any product like this, they are useless and are guaranteed to fail, sooner if not later.</li>
            <li> The vendor didn&#x27;t have the mirror we ordered so they e-mailed and when we called they sent us the upgraded version. Great value for the price.</li>
            <li> This wall mounted brushed nickel finish makeup mirror matches back very well to other brushed nickel pieces in our remodeled bathroom. Faucets and robe hook from 2 different manufacturers match back to this Jerdon makeup mirror.&lt;br /&gt;My contractor installed it into the tile instead of on the sheetrocked wall. The arm is easy to maneuver to swing out to your face and then back to the wall again. I&#x27;ve been using the regular mirror side to apply my makeup and haven&#x27;t tried the 7X magnification yet. The mirrors easily turn over from regular to extreme magnification. This was the final finishing touch for our remodeled bathroom project.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for !!</li>
            <li> Very nice quality mirror. Just what I was looking for.  Would definitely recommend. Very pleased with purchase and would buy again.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a magnifying mirror that would attach to the wall and be able to be extended from the wall.  This is a well made item, exactly what I was looking for.  It attached to the wall easily and performs just like I wanted.  If you need to be able to pluck eyebrows up close, this is for you!</li>
            <li> Nice mirror lacks ability to move vertically. Easy install and compact.&lt;br /&gt;Great for make-up&lt;br /&gt;Nickle finish looks great in any bathroom</li>
            <li> Love this mirror can quickly and was you as describe.&lt;br /&gt;Match my hardware in the bath perfect&lt;br /&gt;i do recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is well made and easy to install. I would recommend to others considering this type of item. Delivery was on time and all parts were inclosed. I used my own achors to mount in drywall. I doubt if the ones included would hold.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice mirror for the price.  I&#x27;m impressed.  It looks great and works very well, too.  I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> It was easy to put up and very sturdy.  It&#x27;s a plus especially for those who must wear glasses, I can see what I need to see.  At first I thought I would need a lighted mirror, but I positioned it by my mirror and the lighting is great.  I greatly recommend this mirror.</li>
            <li> When you wear glasses, trying to do your hair or makeup using a regular mirror in front of the sink is not great (I can&#x27;t see what I am doing at all).  I love this mirror.  I hardly even use the 7x magnification side because the other side is close enough to me that I can see to do my hair and makeup (also great for eyebrow tweezing).  Make sure you hang it at the right height for you.  I screwed it right into a stud using an electric screwdriver and so far it is holding up fine.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent.  It is sturdy, mounts easily  and I can SEE to fix my hair!  I love it!</li>
            <li> After staying in a nice hotel in San Antonio that had one of these mirrors in the bathroom, my wife just had to have one. We searched the Amazon site and finally decided on this one. She is extremely happy - the mirror is sturdy and the magnification is more than enough.</li>
            <li> Zero complaints with this item. I´ve been using it daily for months now and have not noticed any rust. I would highly recommended it if you don&#x27;t mind screwing it into your bathroom wall.</li>
            <li> Love the mirror, the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because I did have to use different screws to attach it to the wall; the hardware provided was not sufficient.</li>
            <li> This mirror fits nicely behind my bathroom door and operates smoothly.  Much nicer than the cheap one I nearly bought at Ikea.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase through Amazon, however I&#x27;d like to add my two cents.  I purchased this in the satin/brushed nickel finish and had it mounted in 2007.  Still going strong, although the base attached to the wall does slightly jiggle due to the weight of the mirror when extended.  Not high-end quality, but it has served my purpose for the last 7 years with multiple daily uses.  I do believe I paid more for it back in 2007 than what Amazon has it listed for.  Try it, you may be happy with it.</li>
            <li> This one was a requested gift.  She loves it!</li>
            <li> I installed this easily by myself in a few minutes.  great  quality, nice to pull magnifying mirror right up to your face.  A must have for bathrooms.</li>
            <li> Use this every day, very sturdy and looks great.</li>
            <li> Feels sturdy, but I still support it at the wall when adjusting it ..... it matches the other hardware great and it was very easy to install!</li>
            <li> What a great deal!  Much better than what I have seen! It&#x27;s sturdy and very pretty with the edging!  THANKS AMAZON! !!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect wall swivel mirror and the magnetism is perfect for applying makeup. Thanks again Amazon!!</li>
            <li> This is a must have if you are elderly.  The magnifying really helps my husband when he is shaving.  He used to miss some of his beard, but all is gone now</li>
            <li> Love this mirror in my bathroom</li>
            <li> My eye sight isn&#x27;t what it use to be and a good quality magnifying mirror has become a must.  This mirror has worked out&lt;br /&gt;perfectly for me.  Love the 7x magnifying side.  I can see even the smallest of hairs. This mirror seems high quality and should last, I was able to hang this myself in about fifteen minutes.  The polished silver gives it a stylish look.  Would recommend this to anyone needing a little extra help seeing!!</li>
            <li> This mirror is a excellent. Be careful about putting it near open windows since it can and will reflect sun light which potentially could cause a fire. Quality is great and preferred it over brick and mortar stores mirrors that were $200+</li>
            <li> mounted it on the wall next to my vanity and omg......what i haven&#x27;t seen in a while was scary!!!!!!!!!  it stinks to wear glasses 24/7 and i love this handy mirror that i installed.  easy to hang and pretty clear for 7x magnification.</li>
            <li> I was staying in a hotel with a magnifying mirror mounted on the wall and thought, that would be nice to have at home!! So, found this one online. Great quality and better price than inferior products at the local building supply stores.</li>
            <li> Used a mirror like this one in the Swan Hotel in Orlando FL recently and had to have one for home. It&#x27;s big so you see your whole face. It flips for regular and magnifying. The magnifying is enough to see all of your facial hairs you are trying to pluck easily.</li>
            <li> Wow! We were really impressed with the quality and workmanship of this mirror. Also, the price was excellent.  We recently stayed at the Westin Resort and Spa in Savannah, and they had this type mirror in their baths. My wife had to have one, or one like it, so, the Jerdon First Class 7X seemed to fill the bill.  After receiving the mirror and installing it on the wall (5 minutes), my wife liked it better than the one at Westin.   If you are boomers like we are, you really need one of these mirrors.  After a certain age you have additional hair growth on your face, ears, and nose that you did not have before. This mirror really exposes your new flaws. If you don&#x27;t care about this new growth, or don&#x27;t want to know don&#x27;t buy this mirror. However, your friends and family will notice, and probably won&#x27;t tell you.</li>
            <li> Having looked through all of the stores, I finally found exactly what I needed here at Amazon; a simple wall mounted adjustable mirror to put my hair up in back using both hands and still see what I was doing. The design is elegant and simple and I discovered how necessary a good magnifying mirror is, which is on the reverse side. It easily moves around so you can view the whole back of the head. Just make sure the mirror is screwed into the wall at the height you require. The assembly and mounting was very simple and easy to understand, and the mirror is sturdily made and doesn&#x27;t wobble. I am very happy with my purchase and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this product. It is even better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I saw this same mirror several other places.  Amazon was by far the best price.  High quality product.</li>
            <li> Very pleased to discover the quality of the mirror, it was better than I expected. I held the base against the wall while my wife extended the mirror &amp; when she had it in the perfect position I marked drill holes and had it installed in less than five minutes. She loves it!</li>
            <li> More than I imagined regarding quality! Love this item as the newest bathroom addition. Installation only required one tool and a terrific son!</li>
            <li> Ordered the mirrors in mid July for my daughter&#x27;s birthday on July 29.  They shipped in time to be here by then.  The shipper (DHL) said they couldn&#x27;t deliver.  They shipped them back to shipper.  Called Amazon.  They shipped them again.  Same thing.  Got to post office.  DHL shipped them back to sender.  May be nice lamps, but I&#x27;ll never know.</li>
            <li> This mirror is really great! I purchased two mirrors and mounted them the same day in two different bathrooms. My mom (68 yrs old) discovered that she has a mole on her eyelid that she had never seen before. My hubby improved on his shaving.  Everyone loves it!  I use it every day for makeup and now I can see the slightest flaw.  I don&#x27;t know how I lived so long without one.  I first saw one of these mirrors in a hotel and knew it was a \\&quot;must have\\&quot;.  It folds neatly against the wall and is sturdy.  The package arrived as promised with all the instructions and nothing broken. I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Loved this Product and Great Price. Great for putting on my  makeup ,and the convenience of it being on the wall.</li>
            <li> Great seller and product.  Like the powerful magnification, have not noticed any distortion, just crystal clear views.  Everyone in our house uses it.  Some of us call it the Ugly Stick because you will see all your flaws in this great mirror.  :-)  After reading reviews, I threw out the included screws and used real drywall mounts that unclip behind the wall.  No problems at all after several months.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone -- got my old mirror off my counter and the size and magnification is great!!!</li>
            <li> Wish mirror was a little larger. other than that very nice. good quality and fair price. will probably purchase one for a gift.</li>
            <li> Great mirror and works really well, good quality and looks it.  Attractive silver finish.  Thinking about ordering another one for my second bath.</li>
            <li> I can see to put on my mascara and the rest of my makeup!  Very easy to install.  My husband has been using it too for trimming his beard.  So, it is getting more use than I expected!</li>
            <li> It is just as described and I can finally see while putting on my makeup.</li>
            <li> I really love the mirror. My eye makeup has never been as perfect!</li>
            <li> Jerdon mirrors were used in a motel I stayed at so when I got home I Googled Jerdon and found them here in plenty of styles and finishes, best for shaving and getting those nasty blackheads off your face.</li>
            <li> The finish is perfect to match my bathroom decor.  Feels sturdy. Had it in place for 1 week.  The price was great and the shipping was free.  Great shipping time.</li>
            <li> Best product for the money.  Very nice styling and very sturdy.  You cant go wrong with this mirror.  Buy it!</li>
            <li> Easy to mount and very useful.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror! I&#x27;m extremely happy with this purchase. So much that I ordered more for family members. I recommend this seller to anyone.</li>
            <li> Good price and good product, what else do you want from a product? &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cute and very sturdy.</li>
            <li> good product, great value. My only concern is after using this 7x magnifying compared to a 5x, I found that I like the 5x better.  It takes your eyes longer to adjust to the 7x. I experienced some eye strain because of it, but nothing major. Still a great product overall, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Quality is a bit disappointing. It was assembled crookedly where the arm is attached to the plate. Noticeable and annoying.&lt;br /&gt;Great to use.</li>
            <li> Nice mirror.  Easy to install and the wife loves it.</li>
            <li> I love it - i highly recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s &#x27;eyes have aged&#x27; but they still like to put eye makeup on!</li>
            <li> This was everything that I expected.  I love it. It swings out nice and back up against the wall when your done.  I saw this at a Hotel and when I got home I ordered it.  Also I like that it came in the Nickel finish too.</li>
            <li> I looked all over to find this little gem. I did my bathroom over &amp; used brushed silver to accessorize , lo and behold I found this mirror. I already had a similar one but it was old .I knew I wasn&#x27;t going to be without one because they are wonderful for applying makeup .</li>
            <li> I only wish I had known how the 7x power would be...Makes me stand closer that I would like...but now I can see to put on makeup..</li>
            <li> This mirror is great.  It was easy to install and I loved the price.  I would surely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The mirror is great.  I love the 7X magnification and nickel finish.  The mirror and arm are great quality.  It is exactly what I was looking for.  Most mirrors are only 5X.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m in my early 60&#x27;s, I need a magnified makeup mirror.  This one mounts on the wall very conveniently and I use it several times a day.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice mirror for the money.  I have seen similar standing mirrors in department stores selling for much more.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Perfect size - I can easily see my whole face.  Love the magnification on this mirror!!  At 7x it allows me to put on my eye make-up with no problem!  It is slim and fits nicely against the wall.  The only negative I found was that the joints on the swivel arms are stiff and require more effort to open and close than I would expect.  We even put WD40 on it in hopes of loosening it up, but to no avail - they are still tight.  It is not terrible, just a little annoying, but overall I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.  I would order again.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my mom.  She likes to see the back of her hair and this works great.  She said that she didn&#x27;t realize how much she would enjoy the magnification for putting on her eye make-up etc... I like the look of it.  It has a little extra detail that makes it look classy and decorative and the nickel finish matches her bathroom perfectly.  I am pleased with the quality and feel that it was an extremely good buy.</li>
            <li> It was a bummer because the wall mount didn&#x27;t match my mom&#x27;s old wall mount. But i&#x27;m sure the product would work perfectly fine for someone who isn&#x27;t trying to match a specific wall mount!</li>
            <li> Great! Just as advertised.  Got the idea of buying one for each of my home bathroom&#x27;s after I stayed at a Five Star hotel in Washington DC last week.</li>
            <li> helps a lot as we age</li>
            <li> Perfect for our bathroom. Just as advertised and arrived in amazingly short time.</li>
            <li> Broken within a week. And I love the clear magnification. But the swing part is broken. First a washer fell out.. When I looked to see, the mirror part came off in my hand.&lt;br /&gt; I had to wait for the handyman to originally install it just right in the first place. Having done that, now the return time has played out and I am left with a broken item.</li>
            <li> This mirror is perfect for my small bathroom. I mounted it right next to the medicine cabinet and it lays flat against the wall when not in use. Its much cheaper than those found at large retailers like Bed Bath and Beyond. The magnified side works wonders for makeup and such. The arms were a bit stiff at first, but after some use they loosened up.</li>
            <li> This mirror is exactly what we wanted in our bathroom.  The only drawback is that the extension arm is very tight in one direction.</li>
            <li> Nice quality mirror.  Seems well made, easy to hang. Good value for the money.  Would recommend this for anyone looking for a wall mounted mirror at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Definitely helps me while I&#x27;m putting on makeup. I just wish it came with a light. Great for using when tweezing your eyebrows too.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and a couple of people mentioned the finished product, when mounted, was off. My husband, who is good with this kind of stuff, followed the instructions and the mirror, when folded back against the wall, looked like it was slanted. It was, but I didn&#x27;t want to remount and have to repaint, etc.etc. The manufacturers need to make it CLEAR, that  following the template is not enough. You need to level the arms before finishing.</li>
            <li> This is the third time I have bought and mounted one of these Jerdon 7507 mirrors.  I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the price, the design and the ease of operation.  I have always mounted these directly to a wall stud, so acquiring a stud finder is a recommended tool before you get started.  Just pick a stud where the mirror, when folded flat, will fit in a desirable location - also make sure the arms will be &amp;#34;level&amp;#34; when it is folded away (so be extra careful when mounting the backing plate to ensure this leveling).  My third time was about a five minute installation - wife has been very pleased each and every time.  The pivoting mechanism is robust and the tension can be adjusted or tightened via the down-facing screws if desired or necessary.  Recommended product!</li>
            <li> Works great and is easy to mount. Does the job that it was designed to do and is not obtrusive in any way.</li>
            <li> Very nice, sturdy and attractive.  Looks great too.  Glad I spent the extra few dollars and got a very nice mirror.</li>
            <li> Needed a magnification and regular mirror that would allow me to put on makeup, etc., without having to lean over the bathroom sink and this does the job.</li>
            <li> After staying at a nice hotel which had a bathroom mirror that swiveled toward you and allowed me to put on my eye make-up without glasses, I was determined to find one for our own bathroom.  This was perfect, not too expensive and exactly what the doctor ordered.  This mirror is especially nice because it folds flat against the wall and out of the way when you don&#x27;t need it.  After a few months, it will pay for itself because now I can see well enough to tweeze my own eyebrows!</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror about 6 months ago. I originally bought one from HOme Depot, but it was cheesy, very flimsy and cheaply made.  This one is perfect.</li>
            <li> After having used a similar mirror for a week on a cruise ship, I decided I wanted one at home as well. I was expecting to have to hang a typical chrome finish mirror but was pleasantly surprised to see this nickel finish. Looks as great as its functional.</li>
