            <li>Love love love love this spray.</li>
            <li>so much more dignified than flapping hands or homemade fans:-)    </li>
            <li>I set my makeup with it &amp; spritz more during the day when it&#x27;s summer.</li>
            <li>i love with it.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This spray is nice and clean going on.  </li>
            <li>Very refreshing and my face looks glowy (not too much) after each use; took 5-10 yrs off!!</li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for, great product, quickly sent.</li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s great for my skin type (58 years old).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this mist for easily 6+ years.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t wear sunscreen underneath my makeup, it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth</li>
            <li>This is a nice spray on its own to refresh your face when it is feeling dry.</li>
            <li>and you actually have a nice healthy glow to your skin.</li>
            <li>I keep trying to clean it</li>
            <li>This really does give your face a very nice and natural glow.  </li>
            <li>Great for those chronic dry skin sufferers!</li>
            <li>I love this Glo Minerals mist but for some reason the hole where the spray comes out doesn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li>Keep in the fridge for a cool summer treat...</li>
            <li>It adds a natural glow and feels so refreshing.  </li>
            <li>I use with moisturizer at bedtime to hydrate and as a finish spray with fresh make up (powder.)</li>
            <li>Smooths make-up to just the right consistency as not to settle in creases or pores.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I spray this intermittently during the day and it freshens my make up right</li>
            <li>Clean smell that is not overpowering, which I have a very touch nose, so</li>
            <li>The moisture is practically microscopic and sinks into to your skin nicely, with or without makeup....</li>
            <li>Such a refreshing spray mist after applying foundation.  </li>
            <li>Once you apply your powder over your foundation, spray your face with this product, pat gently.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t gently mist the face.</li>
            <li>really moisturizes the skin</li>
            <li>After a few spritz his gives my skin hydration and helps my foundation go on smoothly and cleanly.</li>
            <li>have older skin and this to me is the one item I would not do without.</li>
            <li>Love that it has green tea extract , C , K AND E vitamins .&lt;br</li>
            <li>Living in a hot climate, your makeup feels washed out by the end of the day, and this is a terrific product to moisturize and freshen without having to start all over again from foundation up.</li>
            <li>When some mineral make up gets too thick and feels drying this spray helps to make it look more natural.  </li>
            <li>The icy ,cold mist feels great on your face after a long walk or day out at the pool.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried some other sprays, some of which left a strange residue on my skin that felt odd.  </li>

            <li> ... it makes the Glominerals pressed base look, but I think it&#x27;s adding to my already greasy skin.  </li>

            <li> Once you apply your powder over your foundation, spray your face with this product, pat gently.  The moisture gives your skin a moist, youthful appearance.</li>
            <li> Great product. Goes on smooth and you actually have a nice healthy glow to your skin. I have been using for years. I suggest purchasing a nice brush for application and a spritz of Glo Minerals moist hydration product after for the perfect finish.</li>
            <li> I love this Glo Minerals mist but for some reason the hole where the spray comes out doesn&#x27;t work very well.  I keep trying to clean it thinking it&#x27;s clogged, but it isn&#x27;t.  Otherwise I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> It gives your face the smoothest and softest finish!</li>
            <li> Used this mist for years now.  No burn or sting and feels refreshing.  Keep in the fridge for a cool summer treat...</li>
            <li> A very refreshing finishing spray</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for, great product, quickly sent. Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. The BEST hydrating mist on the market. Love that it has green tea extract , C , K AND E vitamins .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summer skin refresher idea- keep a bottle In the refrigerator. The icy ,cold mist feels great on your face after a long walk or day out at the pool.</li>
            <li> This really does give your face a very nice and natural glow.  Please fix the spray nozzle...it doesn&#x27;t gently mist the face.</li>
            <li> Love love love love this spray. It adds a natural glow and feels so refreshing.  Clean smell that is not overpowering, which I have a very touch nose, so no headaches is very important.</li>
            <li> Love, love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I keep it in my purse and give myself a little spray when I feel rush of heat coming on....so much more dignified than flapping hands or homemade fans:-)    The moisture is practically microscopic and sinks into to your skin nicely, with or without makeup....</li>
            <li> This one made my face break out, so I use it on my arms and legs for a cooling spritz.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mist for easily 6+ years. I&#x27;ve tried others but always go back to the Glo Minerals mist. I set my makeup with it &amp; spritz more during the day when it&#x27;s summer. I have oily combination skin &amp; it&#x27;s great for my skin type (58 years old).</li>
            <li> I use this on a regular basis for several things. Smooths make-up to just the right consistency as not to settle in creases or pores.&lt;br /&gt;Thins out my moisturizer and love the way it feels (I do not like heavy anything on my face and need a real heavy duty moisturizer).&lt;br /&gt;Use during the day for a moisture spritz. Works miracles as a &amp;#34;Freshen up, Pick-me-up&amp;#34;... Also as a cool-down after being out in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;I have older skin and this to me is the one item I would not do without.</li>
            <li> A must for the mineral makeup</li>
            <li> ... it makes the Glominerals pressed base look, but I think it&#x27;s adding to my already greasy skin.  If I don&#x27;t wear sunscreen underneath my makeup, it&#x27;s fine.  If I do, which I&#x27;m diligent about during the day, my face is sliding off within a couple of hours.  Use sparingly.</li>
            <li> A friend brought this on a trip and I fell i love with it.  I&#x27;ve tried some other sprays, some of which left a strange residue on my skin that felt odd.  This spray is nice and clean going on.  I use with moisturizer at bedtime to hydrate and as a finish spray with fresh make up (powder.)</li>
            <li> Very refreshing and the smell is divine!</li>
            <li> I like this spray.  When some mineral make up gets too thick and feels drying this spray helps to make it look more natural.  It is suppose to make the make up last longer, I am not sure if it is the spray of the makeup itself that last long.  This is a nice spray on its own to refresh your face when it is feeling dry.</li>
            <li> Consistently offer great products! Great for those chronic dry skin sufferers! The spritz effect is conveinent and easy to keep in your purse!</li>
            <li> I use this product just before I apply my foundation. My face tends to get very dry after I wash and even after moisturizer. After a few spritz his gives my skin hydration and helps my foundation go on smoothly and cleanly.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing and my face looks glowy (not too much) after each use; took 5-10 yrs off!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Even if not using foundation or bare minerals has Hyalauric  Acid which is awesome for your skin! I use at least 2 or 3 times a day depending if I&#x27;m out bought 2 bottles going to need to replenish my stock.</li>
            <li> GloMinerals had a hydration mist in 2009 that smelled wonderful. I was expecting the same thing. This mist does not smell good. Aromatherapy is part of the misting for me so I give this a thumbs down.</li>
            <li> I spray this intermittently during the day and it freshens my make up right up- really moisturizes the skin too!&lt;br /&gt; great product!</li>
            <li> helps face look flawless! great with glo pressed powder</li>
            <li> I was gifted with this originally, and when I ran out, was sad, sad, sad!  It&#x27;s an awesome product to freshen up your face during the day.

            <li> Such a refreshing spray mist after applying foundation.  It helps with moisturing my skin for the final touch!</li>
