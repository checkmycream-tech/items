            <li>but the price was good.</li>
            <li>These are pain free and will make you look great!</li>
            <li>It also tastes good.</li>

            <li>packaging good...</li>
            <li>The price is good, but user beware.  </li>
            <li>Best cleaning system available.  </li>
            <li>You must purchase the teeth trays from your dentist to get a excellent fit.</li>
            <li>These do just as good as what I got from my orthodontist after I got my braces off.</li>
            <li>and I would say my teeth are a good two or three shades lighter already</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s just not as good a result,in fact no result .</li>

            <li>It came in a timely fashion, thank you, and I was very pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used higher percentage bleach and this is the level that works best for me.</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>

            <li>You will love your teeth!</li>
            <li>works great, easy to use, too....  </li>
            <li>My teeth look naturally bright and healthy.</li>
            <li>Dentist wanted to charge me 25$ per syringe of this and after going to amazon I saw this amazing product.</li>
            <li>This works amazingly well and am still using it till this day.</li>
            <li>The whitening power is amazing.</li>
            <li>The product and this method of tooth whitening is effective but you need to be patient and diligent.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice if it came with directions</li>
            <li>This product is truly effective.  </li>
            <li>The whitening gel is effective.</li>
            <li>Nice stuff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an effective product, I would recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t seem honest.  </li>
            <li>You will need to have your own tray.</li>
            <li>Excellent product highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Originally purchased this product from my dentist and found it very effective for whitening teeth.  </li>
            <li>So happy it is available online as I used to purchase it from my dentist &amp; paid more for the product</li>
            <li>Great product and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>It is very strong stuff</li>
            <li>I have use this brand before with great success.  </li>
            <li>I believe it is as effective as the gel that I buy from my dentist for much more $$.</li>
            <li>Great price, and great product for keeping your teeth white.</li>
            <li>great product fast shipping!</li>
            <li>When something looks like it is too good to be true, it is.  </li>
            <li>Always effective and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This is not as strong as the 35%, but still effective for brightening your pearly whites.</li>
            <li>I love opalescence and everytime I order it, they send the product immediately.  </li>
            <li>but I need to do more just waiting because of the sensitivity.</li>
            <li>Love Opalescense.  </li>
            <li>I like the one I bought from my dental clinic better.  </li>
            <li>It works in a shorter amount of time and the results are more noticeable.</li>
            <li>I like this better, works faster.  </li>
            <li>Have used many tubes of this product.</li>
            <li>I have used Opalescence with my bleaching trays for many years and I feel that I know what to expect from the results.</li>
            <li>I have been using Opalescence for many, many years.</li>
            <li>Make sure you read the ingredients in any tooth whitening system if you&#x27;re avoiding fluoride.</li>
            <li>I have used opalescence for years and love the product.</li>
            <li>Much better deal than purchasing at the dentist.</li>
            <li>AND people have been noticing :).</li>
            <li>This is what you buy in most Dental Practices to whiten your teeth when you have custom teeth trays.</li>
            <li>Works very well and a great price.  </li>
            <li>my smile is bright again</li>
            <li>This is most noticeable during brushing.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased Opalescence before and had great results, however with this batch I did not notice much whitening at all.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal, and for a great deal.  </li>
            <li>Love the taste.</li>
            <li>Then instead of getting more gel from your dentist, just order it from Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most of the time I get 2 shades.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>love the ability to refill the whitening gel with the dentists mouth guard.  </li>
            <li>I like this brand better than Nuprogold.</li>
            <li>I use to buy this at the dentist and pay alot more money.  </li>
            <li>Currently approaching week 4.  Very happy with the product.  </li>
            <li>I still love it.</li>
            <li>What more could a girl want?</li>
            <li>Found it on Amazon  at a much better price.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say any more about it.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to get 2 treatments out of one syringe, and now I can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Love the way it works.</li>
            <li>Better than buyin from your Dentists office.</li>
            <li>It works but my teeth hurt more after this brand.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product, my friend paid a dentist $400 to whiten her teeth with same treatment.</li>
            <li>If you have used bleach before, one or two times works for touching up.</li>
            <li>I used to buy it from my dentist, love that I can buy it online instead.</li>
            <li>have used this tooth whitening system before, provided by my dentist who charged MANY times what you can pay for them on amazon.  </li>
            <li>My teeth tend to be slightly yellow, and that is the type of discoloration that responds best to whitening gels.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to store it in the fridge.</li>
            <li>What more can I say????</li>
            <li>but most of the reviews I read below, some had sensitivity with the 20%.  </li>
            <li>I was glad to see this on Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t keep it on for more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>I had ordered the 15% and I needed more whitening</li>
            <li>After all, I have been doing this for more years than I care to recall</li>
            <li>20% hurts the appropriate 15%</li>
            <li>$33 for opal + $3 trays, If I were to guess I think this will get a lot more use and whitening for the price vs strips.  </li>
            <li>Both top and bottom are whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think these would work better if they came with instructions.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product since I worked for a DMD for many years.</li>
            <li>I love it and rely on it.</li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;ve got your own trays, the Opalescence PF 20% teeth whitening syringes are very quick &amp; easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The stuff worked pretty good.</li>
            <li>The packaging is not the most convenient - it keeps the tubes together, but they can easily fall out of the holder.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it and you will love it too.</li>
            <li>Product is fresh and works amazingly.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic results in 30 mins, better then having a detest to it.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t think it would make that much difference sensitivity wise.</li>
            <li>Good value for the price and much lower than buying in the dentist office.  </li>
            <li>It really works great to whiten your teeth quickly.</li>
            <li>Syringes are easy to use to load tooth trays.</li>
            <li>Easy to uses with trays I had from set up my dentist</li>
            <li>I gain 1.5 shades easy per treatment.</li>
            <li>Noticeable difference easy to use</li>
            <li>This is such a great purchase of this product as you cannot do any better for the price.</li>
            <li>Plus, delivery is very quick and to your door.  </li>
            <li>The syringes are easy to use and are delivering results.  </li>
            <li>this product is easy to use, lightens the teeth and is well priced</li>
            <li>Way too strong, it will burn your gums.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this product from my dentist before, however this didn&#x27;t seem as strong to me.</li>
            <li>Also, the gel was so strong if any gel got on the gums you are done.</li>
            <li>The 20% is WAY too strong.  </li>
            <li>They were too strong for my gums.</li>
            <li>Its the next best thing to the immediate in office procedure that costs a whole lot more.</li>
            <li>Normally, I would think that is good</li>
            <li>I purchased more gel for future touch ups from an Amazon.com vendor because it was more cost effective than purchasing more gel from the dentist.</li>
            <li>Works just fine.  </li>
            <li>Twice a week would be fine</li>
            <li>I noticed a huge difference just after two uses.  </li>
            <li>The 20% strength did not cause sensitivity, which was my primary concern before trying the product.</li>
            <li>The gel still works, but takes longer than the gel I bought at the dentist&#x27;s office with an advanced date of expiration.</li>
            <li>I believe it is important to follow the instructions of the dentist with regard to the amount of gel that is applied to the whitening trays.  </li>
            <li>Sadly, many don&#x27;t even notice their smile in the mirror.</li>
            <li>Works great on our entire family.</li>
            <li>I have used this before....with forms that my dentist had made to fit my teeth.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Has no taste which I enjoy.</li>
            <li>I did not expect much as my teeth need much, but this is good as i can see an improvement easier than most.</li>
            <li>I do use it with a light for two cycles instead of the suggested overnighy.</li>
            <li>White teeth works great.</li>
            <li>This gel has a thicker consistency whuch helps my teeth whitening trays fit a bit tighter.</li>
            <li>Purchasing from this site is much more economical.  </li>
            <li>I recommended this product to her but NOT to go to the dentist for it since it is readily available here.  </li>
            <li>So far so good -</li>
            <li>I normally use a different product but for the price of this one it was affordable and it works great!!</li>
            <li>This whitener is much more potent than the normal strips.</li>
            <li>I accidentally ordered 35% originally and learned quickly that it was too strong.</li>
            <li>Item as described and in original packaging.  </li>
            <li>After 2 to 3 uses you see a significant difference.</li>
            <li>The taste could be better but it whitens very well and it lasts!</li>
            <li>Had some sensitivity originally (I sleep with them in), but just took a one day break</li>
            <li>It did irritate my gums at first, but after a couple days, it was OK.</li>
            <li>Unless, I see a remarkable change within the next 8 applications, I would never by this product again.</li>
            <li>I used to 10% solution from the dentist and wasn&#x27;t quite happy with how long it took to whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li>beautifully- product lasts a very long time- &amp; my teeth are bright but not unnaturally white.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product was fresh and worked fine.</li>
            <li>Nothing special, works as advertised.</li>
            <li>I certainly like this better than strips as well</li>
            <li>I was close, but it is hard to get it perfect on the front of the teeth.</li>
            <li>but I am looking for bright white.  </li>
            <li>Good for keeping your teeth looking white.  </li>
            <li>The price is much more reasonable than getting it from my dentist.</li>
            <li>I love using these jells they really do work.</li>
            <li>and I could never get a full impression.</li>
            <li>It would be a good idea to start with an 8 pack to guarantee you get the white results.</li>
            <li>This 20% blend has a longer application time, but it is more gentle on the teeth and gums than the 35% blend.  </li>
            <li>I had only used the 10% before and had good luck with the product.</li>
            <li>Use at your own pace since the teeth will become sensitive if you overuse.</li>
            <li>now i can come on here and brighted as needed and i get a whole lot more......</li>
            <li>I could buy it much, much more reasonable.  </li>
            <li>really liked it, i&#x27;ve used others in the past and found this whitener for the money works really good</li>
            <li>I love smiling when my teeth are white :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;After I requested refund, the seller acted quickly and issued a UPS pickup and a return receipt for home pickup.</li>
            <li>Simply cover your teeth, apply the tray, go to sleep, and wake up with amazingly white teeth! :D</li>
            <li>Try a the different ones that you initially get with your trays and see which on works best for you.  </li>
            <li>I also buy some 35% for quick tune ups between bleaching.</li>
            <li>all of this helps keep my smile bright and white.</li>
            <li>Seems to whiten quickly</li>
            <li>Packaging was adequate and item arrived undamaged.</li>
            <li>I could&#x27;ve done better buying the crest white strips they work a whole lot better!</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t have high expectations that my teeth will become more whiter.  </li>
            <li>When I contacted the company, they first said they&#x27;d replace the order free of charge, but then emailed again saying no, they would not in fact provide a replacement.  </li>
            <li>This product is great and cost so much less than what you pay if you get it from your dentist.</li>
            <li>It works great and is less spotty than strips.  </li>
            <li>this product runs out so quick, and it did not seem fresh.</li>
            <li>Easy to use; don&#x27;t really taste the mint flavor.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do!</li>
            <li>Im not 100% positive if it is original.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would still use this product and think it&#x27;s a much better alternative to the dentist and their huge prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The green trays are great, just follow instructions</li>
            <li>My teeth are absolutely noticeably whiter but not quite bright white, yet.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the time and money.</li>
            <li>I honestly thought I would never have white teeth.  </li>
            <li>Made me very happy to see them stand behind their business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure to have professional trays.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful stuff, so I switch to Sensodyne toothpaste when using it.</li>
            <li>It has given me confidence in my smile.</li>
            <li>This is the product that my dentist gave me and I can buy them from him, but Amazon offers them at a better price.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s costly, but well worth it.</li>
            <li>For the money that I save it is worth it to me.</li>
            <li>First purchased in the dentist office for several dollars more!  </li>
            <li>It is comfortable to wear and depending upon your individual limitations, it is possible to wear Opalescence for an extended period (hours) with no ill effects and great results.</li>
            <li>the price is definitely right</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if they aren&#x27;t keeping it in the right temperature or shipping it correctly</li>
            <li>And he is right...</li>
            <li>right before a job interview to boot.</li>
            <li>far I&#x27;ve did my top 1 hr for the first application, 2 hr</li>
            <li>Can conduct activities while engaging in normal activities.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an avid coffee drinker and this has already brightened my smile.</li>
            <li>Like many of the reviewers, I was concerned by the apparent lack of the expiration date on the product packaging.</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;[t go ultra white like a freak, just a nice healthy white.</li>
            <li>buy a cheap fine eyeliner brush at your local CVS or Walmart and apply the gel from the syringe to the brush &amp; paint it onto the surfaces of the teeth you want to whiten- then put on your trays and wear for an hour.  </li>
            <li>The 20% solution is the right amount instead of using the 10% or the higher solution.</li>
            <li>SO far superior to the bleaching I had at the dentist some years back for $400.</li>
            <li>Works great even if only left on for 20-30 at a time every couple weeks.</li>
            <li>The ones I get from my dentist, albeit much more expensive, work great.</li>
            <li>My teeth weren&#x27;t heavily stained to begin with and my dentist told me that I would be a great candidate for teeth whitening and that I should see results fast if I followed the directions.</li>
            <li>These are great, the 20% is too high for me; I prefer the 15% with less irritation.</li>
            <li>I would advise anyone to pay the dentist for the professionally fitted trays, then for the Whitening Product of choice one can get that on amazon at a huge dollar savings.</li>
            <li>same stuff I was getting from my dentist for 100$ more</li>
            <li>I first used this when my dentist made a mold of my teeth</li>
            <li>They are very reliable!</li>
            <li>Every sense I got my first whitening gels from the doctors office</li>
            <li>I love the consistency in quality and especially the results!</li>
            <li>The first time I used Opalescence  tooth whitener</li>
            <li>First off.</li>
            <li>Thank you for fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Better than store bought whiteners and cost about the same.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I used all 4 sticks to get to the whiteness I needed.</li>
            <li>First-</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Product came on time and was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time exactly as described.</li>
            <li>So wear for a couple hours at first and work up to all night.  </li>
            <li>Well it burned my gums the first two times I used it didn&#x27;t use it again for a while because of the burning.</li>
            <li>Decided to try again but this time I didn&#x27;t brush my teeth first</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone interested in teeth whitening.</li>
            <li>Fast, reliable recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product and one my dentist sells at at least twice the price,&lt;br /&gt;so buying it online (through Amazon) is the way to go.</li>
            <li>I dug up some info on Ultradent&#x27;s website for another product line they have on the convention they use (and I&#x27;m presuming it is consistent across their product</li>
            <li>These things really DO whiten your teeth!  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t try the overnight method until you first try it for an hour or so.</li>
            <li>did not  realize  how  many  different strengths there was</li>
            <li>I have used this bleach for a long time and I am always happy with how white it makes my teeth.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than buying from my overpriced dentist!</li>
            <li>I will know better the next time.  </li>
            <li>Since there are more good reviews than bad, I decided to take a shot and get the 20% because I could wear the trays for 4 hours a day which is a lot better than having to wear them overnight.  </li>
            <li>So much cheaper than buying it from my dentist !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d suggest a higher PF level for quicker results.</li>
            <li>You do have to use a lot of the tube per tray, but overall I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>The only warning that I have is to make sure it does not get on your gums.</li>
            <li>With strips I find I&#x27;m constantly moving them and touching them with my tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I looked them up everywhere and didn&#x27;t get the correct amount of time with the first cylinder.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully I do better with the second one.</li>
            <li>We love Opalescence PF because we can use it about every 2 months and continue to have white teeth.  </li>
            <li>Much better value than what I can purchase locally.</li>
            <li>This actually works, but make sure you have trays that are molded to your teeth</li>
            <li>Opalescence is good but don&#x27;t buy from this company green dot.  </li>
            <li>It definitely whitens and more effective than other whiteners.  </li>
            <li>they&#x27;re right on Ultradent&#x27;s website (a whole PDF file of instructions, in fact).</li>
            <li>I am almost certain I will be able to achieve the white I am looking for with this stuff though.  </li>
            <li>The 20% was just as effective without the extreme sensitivity.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s effective - Certainly less than 1/2 syringe, and more like only 1/4 was sufficient, per the written instructions included in the packaging.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t knock out white but certainly much whiter than most people my age.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, keep refrigerated, cheap and effective and the same as my dentist gave me for far less money.</li>
            <li>I waited a long while to write this review to make sure it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Works great; use over night every other day for several days.</li>
            <li>This is stronger than what my dentist caries so do not have to leave it on as long (just try not to get it on your gums :))</li>
            <li>always get compliments that I have a nice smile and WHITE teeth, especially the day after using it for touch up.</li>
            <li>they told me (basically) to get lost and they were not going to make good on their original offer, nor stand behind their product.</li>
            <li>Somewhat strong, so I only end up using for 3 hours tops, other wise my teeth get too sensitive.</li>
            <li>I had a dental appointment last week to have my teeth cleaned and the first thing the hygienist said to me was, &amp;#34;you are the first person to come in today with white teeth.&amp;#34; So, I&#x27;m thrilled with the 20%.</li>
            <li>Gets my bottom teeth white and its easy to use.</li>
            <li>This product is so easy to use and you only need to have on your teeth for 1 hour.  </li>
            <li>I am lucky to have clear retainers.</li>
            <li>my teeth became super sensitive.  </li>
            <li>You do not want to make the drop to large or it overflows up into your gums and your gums will be sore for a couple days.</li>
            <li>certainly recommend these to anyone wishing to whiten their teeth.  </li>
            <li>and it was fine the next 3 days straight.</li>
            <li>The product works great and you only need a little bit of the product in your custom molded trays to see a difference.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipment.</li>
            <li>Very gummy, no taste and does nothing from the minute I got it.</li>
            <li>This product works just like the ones that I used to get from my dentist, but at a much lower price.</li>
            <li>and they are SO much cheaper than what I was paying the dentist.</li>
            <li>work well and was reasonable priced.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast and as described 100%</li>
            <li>and it really works.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much cheaper than in dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>I really like this product .</li>
            <li>These work really well, also a lot cheaper then at the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>afraid of damaging my teeth are very healthy .... !!!</li>
            <li>Works really well - but you have to use a lot of the gel for it to work.</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t care about that I wanted my teeth whitened</li>
            <li>Whitens gently.</li>
            <li>(If your trays fit properly, you might not have issues with your gums burning.  </li>
            <li>And the results are very noticeable.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, my dentist gave this to me a year ago</li>
            <li>Who knows what is really in this product.</li>
            <li>Really works well.</li>
            <li>so much whiter.  </li>
            <li>and I found that the 20% was the highest % I could go to not bother my teeth as much.</li>
            <li>This product was shipped in a timely manner and is the real deal.</li>
            <li>because those just hurt so much.</li>
            <li>This product is weaker, but I can tolerate it for much longer and achieve whiteness.</li>
            <li>This works really well.</li>
            <li>so you shouldn&#x27;t have to whiten that much at the end of the treatment.</li>
            <li>My dentist sold me tubes of 10% and it took a much longer time to whiten.</li>
            <li>I really feel this makes a difference in the quality of whitening you get.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>If you are looking for FAST results, use the 30 or 35% solution although you might experience son sensitivity as I did.  </li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>Twenty percent can burn gums if too much is applied to the trays.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t cause sensitivity and is very sticky</li>
            <li>This product really does whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li>I really recommend it.</li>
            <li>Hi, thanks to somebody who posted a week ago, we can all solve the mystery of the expiration date of these teeth whitening syringes.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>This item really works.</li>
            <li>Very displeased.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s really all you need.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed too much sensitivity, but I have been using Sensodyne toothpaste which really helps.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>My teeths are much whiter now, just after one syringe, and I keep to continue to use it.</li>
            <li>You do not need to put too much product, as then you can have pain in your teeth.</li>
            <li>My teeth are pretty white naturally - so I may not have to suffer too much for beauty but be sure to buy a toothpaste for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>but after 1x 4hrs my teeth were significantly whiter and after the 2nd time..</li>
            <li>I used the whole thing and had to wipe off about half or more of the gel.  </li>
            <li>My first application developed immediate results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why Amazon allows this kind of stuff on their site.  </li>
            <li>Never asked my new dentist about it, because it works for me!</li>
            <li>This item caused some damage to my gums but after speaking with my dentist and getting a special over the counter solution all is now back to normal.</li>
            <li>Okay - so I typically buy the Rembrant teeth whitening trays for $20 from Target and figured I would give these a whirl.</li>
            <li>More than half the price.</li>
            <li>Amazon was awesome and promptly refunded my purchase, Don&#x27;t be fooled, Green Dot sucks.</li>
            <li>I have been purcasing this product from my dentist but although it was supposedly the the same 20% strength; it actually seems more like 10%</li>
            <li>The 35% causes a lot more zingers (2-6 second pain in deep treated cavities)</li>
            <li>particular, it</li>
            <li>I have used higher bleach ratios before and they do whiten my teeth more after first use,but if it gets on your gums it&#x27;s not a good thing.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed an immediate whitening​ of my teeth and now use it once a week to maintain, I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>highly recommended</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this gel.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I have been using this stuff now for a little over a week.  </li>
            <li>But WOW I tell you this is the real deal - if you have &amp;#34;tried</li>
            <li>I really wish I spend the money and had them done professionally.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product to anyone with a desire to improve their smile.</li>
            <li>I normally do it before bed and sleep with them</li>
            <li>Be prepared that it will take a week or so to get a white smile.</li>
            <li>Overnight will not work for me, and doesn&#x27;t seem safe, since I left the 15% in too long, maybe 45 minutes accidently</li>
            <li>My teeth gums were super sensitive the following day</li>
            <li>After a while it does turn a bit more stiff though.</li>
            <li>They are still  not chalk white, but they are a creamy white that suits my complexion just fine.  </li>
            <li>Obviously, you want to use enough that the full outer surface of the tooth comes in contact with the gel, but not so much that it squishes all over your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered eight refills and I have used four, so I have a new pack when I need to whiten again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also remove the trays, clean the overage on gums (carefully)</li>
            <li>There are many un-similarities found on packages and this product bought from Green Dot Sales doesn&#x27;t work at all in whitening but leaving my teeth over sensitive.</li>
            <li>You can tell very clearly by looking at the front teeth versus the ones just beyond the whitening tray.</li>
            <li>Very clear results.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth, and I had no issues using this product.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>Only need to whiten every once a month or so after the first three of getting started.</li>
            <li>I am a first time bleacher and after reading several reviews I purchased the 20%.</li>
            <li>I ALWAYS notice other people&#x27;s teeth and think, IF ONLY they had the $ to do this how much better they would look...</li>
            <li>It came on time, the product is exactly what was pictured and my teeth are pearly white.  </li>
            <li>the same product at my dentist&#x27;s office was 10x as much!</li>
            <li>Package arrived on time as promised and item was exactly as it was initially described.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>It whitens as well or better but no gums burned white or tooth sensitivity,  I was really surprised because I couldn&#x27;t even finish a week with the other stuff.</li>
            <li>stuff does burn (just like strips) if it gets on your gums, The spot between my two front upper teeth got burned pretty severely the 3rd time I applied (I used more than previous applications).  </li>
            <li>You want white teeth really quick and beautifully white.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used one tube of the 20% and they are super white!</li>
            <li>The 35% I used was so strong that the tiny amount that gets on your gums (no matter how careful you are) will burn a lot stronger than the 20%.</li>
            <li>I had this from my former dentist who was selling it the gel for twice the price (unknown to me), but then we moved, and my new dentist (now former) was charging more than 3 times the price.</li>
            <li>I bought this product and it is old old old.</li>
            <li>My daughter also used some in her clear retainers.</li>
            <li>mouth (too) sensitive</li>
            <li>I have used this brand before but it had been 35% which turned out to make my teeth uncomfortably sensitive.</li>
            <li>I used it about 3 times but had to stop as my teeth became too sensitive.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any issues with my gums hurting or teeth being sensitive...</li>
            <li>I love tea, so I need to brighten at least once a week.  </li>
            <li>I was told to refrigerate to have the product last longer, which seems to work, but you need to leave it out when you are ready to use.</li>
            <li>Seems like these were old because of the use instructions and probably sitting on a shelf.</li>
            <li>Leave it in overnight and does not make gums too sensitive.</li>
            <li>My dentist sells the complete kit for $225.  </li>
            <li>Got my whitening molds from my dentist (professionally made), then buy these here as it&#x27;s cheaper than buying from the dentist.</li>
            <li>Whitens without sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I got the trays from my dentist (professionally sized).</li>
            <li>I have used 2 syringes so far and no burned gums even if some lands on them.</li>
            <li>They will professionally make you a tray.</li>
            <li>Arrived early...</li>
            <li>save your money,it&#x27;s old and ineffective</li>
            <li>but my teeth are so sensitive that I they ache for hours after wearing the trays for 1 hour 1/2.</li>
            <li>i was getting these from my dentist after having my teeth professionally whitened....</li>
            <li>Put a drop directly on to each tooth then put your trays on.</li>
            <li>I just received my eight syringes and they were all marked O065</li>
            <li>Worked fast and my teeth are so white!</li>
            <li>so I was Sooo happily surprised that I didnt have to.</li>
            <li>DO NOT waste your money.</li>
            <li>I am a long time user of this product since it was first introduced int he market.</li>
            <li>We purchase the teeth whitening from you on a regular basis and find it much cheaper than our dentisit.</li>
            <li>It was a bit sensitive after 2 days</li>
            <li>Then depending on what you have left a 4 syringe pack should come close to maintaining your white smile by treating every 2-3 months.</li>
            <li>I had previously used the 15 percent stuff, but it didn&#x27;t do the trick as quickly as I wanted.  </li>
            <li>The dentist assistant said I probably wasn&#x27;t using the same product, but when I brought my Opalescence in, it was exactly the same as they were selling which they admitted.</li>
            <li>Let me state, this is the exact same brand my dentist has been selling me for years for upwards of $15 a syringe and only the !5% strength.  </li>
            <li>It brightens and whitens your teeth like no other!</li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>Tooth sensitivity is normal with use of this product initially.</li>
            <li>I stuck it out and the burn wore off after 2 or 3 minutes, but it was a pretty intense 2-3 minutes, and 3 days later that little area is still sensitive to touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and he said it was not active.</li>
            <li>so I might have even gone with a less powerful formula than the 20%  </li>
            <li>Watch out - you will have very sensitive teeth, especially the front teeth which thruout the day will &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>The only precaution I have is for people with very sensitive teeth should avoid stronger solutions  </li>
            <li>and there is no tingling and no sensitivity when before I have had major sensitivity, which means its not working.</li>
            <li>Works decent but they are not clear about putting fluoride in this.</li>
            <li>She said any of the Ultadent product sold via the web could be a risk to both your dental health as well as your general health.  </li>
            <li>look on the side of the clear plastic tubing on EACH individual tube.  </li>
            <li>It is in raised clear letters/numbers and is not obvious, you have to look closely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it since the end of May, and it&#x27;s barely made a difference.</li>
            <li>I was patient in waiting for pearly white results and my teeth still look like an old beaver&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in early 60&#x27;s doing it for last 3 yrs.</li>
            <li>You will notice a considerable difference of appearance in your teeth only after one week using the 20% solution.  </li>
            <li>Apparently this product was not what was advertised.  </li>
            <li>I bought opalescence 20% because the reviews of the 35% were scary(severe pain,bleached gums etc)The 20% has done nothing to whiten my teeth,I dont know if it is old or what, but I wish  that I had just bought Crest strips from my local store because they are always reliable.</li>
            <li>, the only downside vs strips is you can&#x27;t really go out in public with a whitening tray in your mouth (also unpleasant with strips but with the clear ones you can manage), however I find the tray to be more comfortable than strips, they move around on your teeth, the trays stay put and little to none of it gets in your mouth.</li>
            <li>Works great and less expensive.</li>
            <li>Some of the product seemed to have the same strength as the stuff sold but my dentist, but most of it was weak and did not lighten my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Be VERY CERTAIN that it doesn&#x27;t get applied too heavily or it will squish out ONTO your gums.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong enough to slowly whiten your teeth with no white spots.</li>
            <li>I bought the 20% and was a little reluctant at first because I do have sensitivity issues with my teeth.  </li>
            <li>is exactly the same product at half the price.</li>
            <li>Not useful at 20% even if you use it twice as much.</li>
            <li>Prime customers:pay the extra shipping, apparently that&#x27;s where the quality lies.</li>
            <li>Generally, the dentist or the veterinarian will be the MOST expensive place to find supplies and meds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works very well and much less than my dentist charges.</li>
            <li>I dry them, and then I put the product on my finger and directly to my teeth</li>
            <li>I then went on-line to see about getting the product for less and much to my surprise</li>
            <li>The CS rep that I spoke with said they only sell to dentist offices and never to the general public.  </li>
            <li>This was the first time I ordered from Green Dot Sales, and it will be the last!</li>
            <li>This product works great even for sensitive teeth (use it everyother day), less expensive then purchasing it directly from my dentist as I have in the past.</li>
            <li>You would think this would work at least a little better than Crest white strips.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve used a little over 1 syringe approximately 6 hours in 3 applications each to both top and bottom.</li>
            <li>Some honest reviewers do not understand what a product is for or how to use it and will trash a product simply because they are just plain dumb.</li>

            <li> Dilever in the time and good quality.</li>
            <li> packaging good...</li>
            <li> The price is good, but user beware.  </li>
            <li> Best cleaning system available.  </li>
            <li> You must purchase the teeth trays from your dentist to get a excellent fit.</li>
            <li> These do just as good as what I got from my orthodontist after I got my braces off.</li>
            <li> and I would say my teeth are a good two or three shades lighter already</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s just not as good a result,in fact no result .</li>

            <li> Dentist wanted to charge me 25$ per syringe of this and after going to amazon I saw this amazing product.</li>
            <li> This works amazingly well and am still using it till this day.</li>
            <li> The whitening power is amazing.</li>
            <li> The product and this method of tooth whitening is effective but you need to be patient and diligent.  </li>
            <li> It would be nice if it came with directions</li>
            <li> This product is truly effective.  </li>
            <li> The whitening gel is effective.</li>
            <li> Nice stuff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is an effective product, I would recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t seem honest.  </li>
            <li> You will need to have your own tray.</li>
            <li> Excellent product highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Originally purchased this product from my dentist and found it very effective for whitening teeth.  </li>
            <li> So happy it is available online as I used to purchase it from my dentist &amp; paid more for the product</li>
            <li> Great product and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> It is very strong stuff</li>
            <li> I have use this brand before with great success.  </li>
            <li> I believe it is as effective as the gel that I buy from my dentist for much more $$.</li>
            <li> Great price, and great product for keeping your teeth white.</li>
            <li> great product fast shipping!</li>
            <li> When something looks like it is too good to be true, it is.  </li>
            <li> Always effective and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This is not as strong as the 35%, but still effective for brightening your pearly whites.</li>
            <li> I love opalescence and everytime I order it, they send the product immediately.  </li>
            <li> but I need to do more just waiting because of the sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Love Opalescense.  </li>
            <li> I like the one I bought from my dental clinic better.  </li>
            <li> It works in a shorter amount of time and the results are more noticeable.</li>
            <li> I like this better, works faster.  </li>
            <li> Have used many tubes of this product.</li>
            <li> I have used Opalescence with my bleaching trays for many years and I feel that I know what to expect from the results.</li>
            <li> I have been using Opalescence for many, many years.</li>
            <li> Make sure you read the ingredients in any tooth whitening system if you&#x27;re avoiding fluoride.</li>
            <li> I have used opalescence for years and love the product.</li>
            <li> Much better deal than purchasing at the dentist.</li>
            <li> AND people have been noticing :).</li>
            <li> This is what you buy in most Dental Practices to whiten your teeth when you have custom teeth trays.</li>
            <li> Works very well and a great price.  </li>
            <li> my smile is bright again</li>
            <li> This is most noticeable during brushing.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased Opalescence before and had great results, however with this batch I did not notice much whitening at all.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal, and for a great deal.  </li>
            <li> Love the taste.</li>
            <li> Then instead of getting more gel from your dentist, just order it from Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most of the time I get 2 shades.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> love the ability to refill the whitening gel with the dentists mouth guard.  </li>
            <li> I like this brand better than Nuprogold.</li>
            <li> I use to buy this at the dentist and pay alot more money.  </li>
            <li> Currently approaching week 4.  Very happy with the product.  </li>
            <li> I still love it.</li>
            <li> What more could a girl want?</li>
            <li> Found it on Amazon  at a much better price.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say any more about it.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to get 2 treatments out of one syringe, and now I can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Love the way it works.</li>
            <li> Better than buyin from your Dentists office.</li>
            <li> It works but my teeth hurt more after this brand.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product, my friend paid a dentist $400 to whiten her teeth with same treatment.</li>
            <li> If you have used bleach before, one or two times works for touching up.</li>
            <li> I used to buy it from my dentist, love that I can buy it online instead.</li>
            <li> have used this tooth whitening system before, provided by my dentist who charged MANY times what you can pay for them on amazon.  </li>
            <li> My teeth tend to be slightly yellow, and that is the type of discoloration that responds best to whitening gels.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to store it in the fridge.</li>
            <li> What more can I say????</li>
            <li> but most of the reviews I read below, some had sensitivity with the 20%.  </li>
            <li> I was glad to see this on Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t keep it on for more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I had ordered the 15% and I needed more whitening</li>
            <li> After all, I have been doing this for more years than I care to recall</li>
            <li> 20% hurts the appropriate 15%</li>
            <li> $33 for opal + $3 trays, If I were to guess I think this will get a lot more use and whitening for the price vs strips.  </li>
            <li> Both top and bottom are whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think these would work better if they came with instructions.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since I worked for a DMD for many years.</li>
            <li> I love it and rely on it.</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve got your own trays, the Opalescence PF 20% teeth whitening syringes are very quick &amp; easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The stuff worked pretty good.</li>
            <li> The packaging is not the most convenient - it keeps the tubes together, but they can easily fall out of the holder.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it and you will love it too.</li>
            <li> Product is fresh and works amazingly.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic results in 30 mins, better then having a detest to it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think it would make that much difference sensitivity wise.</li>
            <li> Good value for the price and much lower than buying in the dentist office.  </li>
            <li> It really works great to whiten your teeth quickly.</li>
            <li> Syringes are easy to use to load tooth trays.</li>
            <li> Easy to uses with trays I had from set up my dentist</li>
            <li> I gain 1.5 shades easy per treatment.</li>
            <li> Noticeable difference easy to use</li>
            <li> This is such a great purchase of this product as you cannot do any better for the price.</li>
            <li> Plus, delivery is very quick and to your door.  </li>
            <li> The syringes are easy to use and are delivering results.  </li>
            <li> this product is easy to use, lightens the teeth and is well priced</li>
            <li> Way too strong, it will burn your gums.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product from my dentist before, however this didn&#x27;t seem as strong to me.</li>
            <li> Also, the gel was so strong if any gel got on the gums you are done.</li>
            <li> The 20% is WAY too strong.  </li>
            <li> They were too strong for my gums.</li>
            <li> Its the next best thing to the immediate in office procedure that costs a whole lot more.</li>
            <li> Normally, I would think that is good</li>
            <li> I purchased more gel for future touch ups from an Amazon.com vendor because it was more cost effective than purchasing more gel from the dentist.</li>
            <li> Works just fine.  </li>
            <li> Twice a week would be fine</li>
            <li> I noticed a huge difference just after two uses.  </li>
            <li> The 20% strength did not cause sensitivity, which was my primary concern before trying the product.</li>
            <li> The gel still works, but takes longer than the gel I bought at the dentist&#x27;s office with an advanced date of expiration.</li>
            <li> I believe it is important to follow the instructions of the dentist with regard to the amount of gel that is applied to the whitening trays.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, many don&#x27;t even notice their smile in the mirror.</li>
            <li> Works great on our entire family.</li>
            <li> I have used this before....with forms that my dentist had made to fit my teeth.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Has no taste which I enjoy.</li>
            <li> I did not expect much as my teeth need much, but this is good as i can see an improvement easier than most.</li>
            <li> I do use it with a light for two cycles instead of the suggested overnighy.</li>
            <li> White teeth works great.</li>
            <li> This gel has a thicker consistency whuch helps my teeth whitening trays fit a bit tighter.</li>
            <li> Purchasing from this site is much more economical.  </li>
            <li> I recommended this product to her but NOT to go to the dentist for it since it is readily available here.  </li>
            <li> So far so good -</li>
            <li> I normally use a different product but for the price of this one it was affordable and it works great!!</li>
            <li> This whitener is much more potent than the normal strips.</li>
            <li> I accidentally ordered 35% originally and learned quickly that it was too strong.</li>
            <li> Item as described and in original packaging.  </li>
            <li> After 2 to 3 uses you see a significant difference.</li>
            <li> The taste could be better but it whitens very well and it lasts!</li>
            <li> Had some sensitivity originally (I sleep with them in), but just took a one day break</li>
            <li> It did irritate my gums at first, but after a couple days, it was OK.</li>
            <li> Unless, I see a remarkable change within the next 8 applications, I would never by this product again.</li>
            <li> I used to 10% solution from the dentist and wasn&#x27;t quite happy with how long it took to whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li> beautifully- product lasts a very long time- &amp; my teeth are bright but not unnaturally white.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product was fresh and worked fine.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, works as advertised.</li>
            <li> I certainly like this better than strips as well</li>
            <li> I was close, but it is hard to get it perfect on the front of the teeth.</li>
            <li> but I am looking for bright white.  </li>
            <li> Good for keeping your teeth looking white.  </li>
            <li> The price is much more reasonable than getting it from my dentist.</li>
            <li> I love using these jells they really do work.</li>
            <li> and I could never get a full impression.</li>
            <li> It would be a good idea to start with an 8 pack to guarantee you get the white results.</li>
            <li> This 20% blend has a longer application time, but it is more gentle on the teeth and gums than the 35% blend.  </li>
            <li> I had only used the 10% before and had good luck with the product.</li>
            <li> Use at your own pace since the teeth will become sensitive if you overuse.</li>
            <li> now i can come on here and brighted as needed and i get a whole lot more......</li>
            <li> I could buy it much, much more reasonable.  </li>
            <li> really liked it, i&#x27;ve used others in the past and found this whitener for the money works really good</li>
            <li> I love smiling when my teeth are white :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I requested refund, the seller acted quickly and issued a UPS pickup and a return receipt for home pickup.</li>
            <li> Simply cover your teeth, apply the tray, go to sleep, and wake up with amazingly white teeth! :D</li>
            <li> Try a the different ones that you initially get with your trays and see which on works best for you.  </li>
            <li> I also buy some 35% for quick tune ups between bleaching.</li>
            <li> all of this helps keep my smile bright and white.</li>
            <li> Seems to whiten quickly</li>
            <li> Packaging was adequate and item arrived undamaged.</li>
            <li> I could&#x27;ve done better buying the crest white strips they work a whole lot better!</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have high expectations that my teeth will become more whiter.  </li>
            <li> When I contacted the company, they first said they&#x27;d replace the order free of charge, but then emailed again saying no, they would not in fact provide a replacement.  </li>
            <li> This product is great and cost so much less than what you pay if you get it from your dentist.</li>
            <li> It works great and is less spotty than strips.  </li>
            <li> this product runs out so quick, and it did not seem fresh.</li>
            <li> Easy to use; don&#x27;t really taste the mint flavor.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do!</li>
            <li> Im not 100% positive if it is original.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would still use this product and think it&#x27;s a much better alternative to the dentist and their huge prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The green trays are great, just follow instructions</li>
            <li> My teeth are absolutely noticeably whiter but not quite bright white, yet.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the time and money.</li>
            <li> I honestly thought I would never have white teeth.  </li>
            <li> Made me very happy to see them stand behind their business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make sure to have professional trays.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful stuff, so I switch to Sensodyne toothpaste when using it.</li>
            <li> It has given me confidence in my smile.</li>
            <li> This is the product that my dentist gave me and I can buy them from him, but Amazon offers them at a better price.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s costly, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> For the money that I save it is worth it to me.</li>
            <li> First purchased in the dentist office for several dollars more!  </li>
            <li> It is comfortable to wear and depending upon your individual limitations, it is possible to wear Opalescence for an extended period (hours) with no ill effects and great results.</li>
            <li> the price is definitely right</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they aren&#x27;t keeping it in the right temperature or shipping it correctly</li>
            <li> And he is right...</li>
            <li> right before a job interview to boot.</li>
            <li> far I&#x27;ve did my top 1 hr for the first application, 2 hr</li>
            <li> Can conduct activities while engaging in normal activities.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid coffee drinker and this has already brightened my smile.</li>
            <li> Like many of the reviewers, I was concerned by the apparent lack of the expiration date on the product packaging.</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;[t go ultra white like a freak, just a nice healthy white.</li>
            <li> buy a cheap fine eyeliner brush at your local CVS or Walmart and apply the gel from the syringe to the brush &amp; paint it onto the surfaces of the teeth you want to whiten- then put on your trays and wear for an hour.  </li>
            <li> The 20% solution is the right amount instead of using the 10% or the higher solution.</li>
            <li> SO far superior to the bleaching I had at the dentist some years back for $400.</li>
            <li> Works great even if only left on for 20-30 at a time every couple weeks.</li>
            <li> The ones I get from my dentist, albeit much more expensive, work great.</li>
            <li> My teeth weren&#x27;t heavily stained to begin with and my dentist told me that I would be a great candidate for teeth whitening and that I should see results fast if I followed the directions.</li>
            <li> These are great, the 20% is too high for me; I prefer the 15% with less irritation.</li>
            <li> I would advise anyone to pay the dentist for the professionally fitted trays, then for the Whitening Product of choice one can get that on amazon at a huge dollar savings.</li>
            <li> same stuff I was getting from my dentist for 100$ more</li>
            <li> I first used this when my dentist made a mold of my teeth</li>
            <li> They are very reliable!</li>
            <li> Every sense I got my first whitening gels from the doctors office</li>
            <li> I love the consistency in quality and especially the results!</li>
            <li> The first time I used Opalescence  tooth whitener</li>
            <li> First off.</li>
            <li> Thank you for fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Better than store bought whiteners and cost about the same.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I used all 4 sticks to get to the whiteness I needed.</li>
            <li> First-</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Product came on time and was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time exactly as described.</li>
            <li> So wear for a couple hours at first and work up to all night.  </li>
            <li> Well it burned my gums the first two times I used it didn&#x27;t use it again for a while because of the burning.</li>
            <li> Decided to try again but this time I didn&#x27;t brush my teeth first</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone interested in teeth whitening.</li>
            <li> Fast, reliable recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product and one my dentist sells at at least twice the price,&lt;br /&gt;so buying it online (through Amazon) is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I dug up some info on Ultradent&#x27;s website for another product line they have on the convention they use (and I&#x27;m presuming it is consistent across their product</li>
            <li> These things really DO whiten your teeth!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try the overnight method until you first try it for an hour or so.</li>
            <li> did not  realize  how  many  different strengths there was</li>
            <li> I have used this bleach for a long time and I am always happy with how white it makes my teeth.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than buying from my overpriced dentist!</li>
            <li> I will know better the next time.  </li>
            <li> Since there are more good reviews than bad, I decided to take a shot and get the 20% because I could wear the trays for 4 hours a day which is a lot better than having to wear them overnight.  </li>
            <li> So much cheaper than buying it from my dentist !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest a higher PF level for quicker results.</li>
            <li> You do have to use a lot of the tube per tray, but overall I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> The only warning that I have is to make sure it does not get on your gums.</li>
            <li> With strips I find I&#x27;m constantly moving them and touching them with my tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I looked them up everywhere and didn&#x27;t get the correct amount of time with the first cylinder.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully I do better with the second one.</li>
            <li> We love Opalescence PF because we can use it about every 2 months and continue to have white teeth.  </li>
            <li> Much better value than what I can purchase locally.</li>
            <li> This actually works, but make sure you have trays that are molded to your teeth</li>
            <li> Opalescence is good but don&#x27;t buy from this company green dot.  </li>
            <li> It definitely whitens and more effective than other whiteners.  </li>
            <li> they&#x27;re right on Ultradent&#x27;s website (a whole PDF file of instructions, in fact).</li>
            <li> I am almost certain I will be able to achieve the white I am looking for with this stuff though.  </li>
            <li> The 20% was just as effective without the extreme sensitivity.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s effective - Certainly less than 1/2 syringe, and more like only 1/4 was sufficient, per the written instructions included in the packaging.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t knock out white but certainly much whiter than most people my age.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, keep refrigerated, cheap and effective and the same as my dentist gave me for far less money.</li>
            <li> I waited a long while to write this review to make sure it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Works great; use over night every other day for several days.</li>
            <li> This is stronger than what my dentist caries so do not have to leave it on as long (just try not to get it on your gums :))</li>
            <li> always get compliments that I have a nice smile and WHITE teeth, especially the day after using it for touch up.</li>
            <li> they told me (basically) to get lost and they were not going to make good on their original offer, nor stand behind their product.</li>
            <li> Somewhat strong, so I only end up using for 3 hours tops, other wise my teeth get too sensitive.</li>
            <li> I had a dental appointment last week to have my teeth cleaned and the first thing the hygienist said to me was, &amp;#34;you are the first person to come in today with white teeth.&amp;#34; So, I&#x27;m thrilled with the 20%.</li>
            <li> Gets my bottom teeth white and its easy to use.</li>
            <li> This product is so easy to use and you only need to have on your teeth for 1 hour.  </li>
            <li> I am lucky to have clear retainers.</li>
            <li> my teeth became super sensitive.  </li>
            <li> You do not want to make the drop to large or it overflows up into your gums and your gums will be sore for a couple days.</li>
            <li> certainly recommend these to anyone wishing to whiten their teeth.  </li>
            <li> and it was fine the next 3 days straight.</li>
            <li> The product works great and you only need a little bit of the product in your custom molded trays to see a difference.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipment.</li>
            <li> Very gummy, no taste and does nothing from the minute I got it.</li>
            <li> This product works just like the ones that I used to get from my dentist, but at a much lower price.</li>
            <li> and they are SO much cheaper than what I was paying the dentist.</li>
            <li> work well and was reasonable priced.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and as described 100%</li>
            <li> and it really works.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much cheaper than in dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> I really like this product .</li>
            <li> These work really well, also a lot cheaper then at the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> afraid of damaging my teeth are very healthy .... !!!</li>
            <li> Works really well - but you have to use a lot of the gel for it to work.</li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t care about that I wanted my teeth whitened</li>
            <li> Whitens gently.</li>
            <li> (If your trays fit properly, you might not have issues with your gums burning.  </li>
            <li> And the results are very noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, my dentist gave this to me a year ago</li>
            <li> Who knows what is really in this product.</li>
            <li> Really works well.</li>
            <li> so much whiter.  </li>
            <li> and I found that the 20% was the highest % I could go to not bother my teeth as much.</li>
            <li> This product was shipped in a timely manner and is the real deal.</li>
            <li> because those just hurt so much.</li>
            <li> This product is weaker, but I can tolerate it for much longer and achieve whiteness.</li>
            <li> This works really well.</li>
            <li> so you shouldn&#x27;t have to whiten that much at the end of the treatment.</li>
            <li> My dentist sold me tubes of 10% and it took a much longer time to whiten.</li>
            <li> I really feel this makes a difference in the quality of whitening you get.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for FAST results, use the 30 or 35% solution although you might experience son sensitivity as I did.  </li>
            <li> It works very well.  </li>
            <li> Twenty percent can burn gums if too much is applied to the trays.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cause sensitivity and is very sticky</li>
            <li> This product really does whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li> I really recommend it.</li>
            <li> Hi, thanks to somebody who posted a week ago, we can all solve the mystery of the expiration date of these teeth whitening syringes.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> This item really works.</li>
            <li> Very displeased.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s really all you need.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed too much sensitivity, but I have been using Sensodyne toothpaste which really helps.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> My teeths are much whiter now, just after one syringe, and I keep to continue to use it.</li>
            <li> You do not need to put too much product, as then you can have pain in your teeth.</li>
            <li> My teeth are pretty white naturally - so I may not have to suffer too much for beauty but be sure to buy a toothpaste for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> but after 1x 4hrs my teeth were significantly whiter and after the 2nd time..</li>
            <li> I used the whole thing and had to wipe off about half or more of the gel.  </li>
            <li> My first application developed immediate results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why Amazon allows this kind of stuff on their site.  </li>
            <li> Never asked my new dentist about it, because it works for me!</li>
            <li> This item caused some damage to my gums but after speaking with my dentist and getting a special over the counter solution all is now back to normal.</li>
            <li> Okay - so I typically buy the Rembrant teeth whitening trays for $20 from Target and figured I would give these a whirl.</li>
            <li> More than half the price.</li>
            <li> Amazon was awesome and promptly refunded my purchase, Don&#x27;t be fooled, Green Dot sucks.</li>
            <li> I have been purcasing this product from my dentist but although it was supposedly the the same 20% strength; it actually seems more like 10%</li>
            <li> The 35% causes a lot more zingers (2-6 second pain in deep treated cavities)</li>
            <li> particular, it</li>
            <li> I have used higher bleach ratios before and they do whiten my teeth more after first use,but if it gets on your gums it&#x27;s not a good thing.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed an immediate whitening​ of my teeth and now use it once a week to maintain, I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> highly recommended</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this gel.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I have been using this stuff now for a little over a week.  </li>
            <li> But WOW I tell you this is the real deal - if you have &amp;#34;tried</li>
            <li> I really wish I spend the money and had them done professionally.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product to anyone with a desire to improve their smile.</li>
            <li> I normally do it before bed and sleep with them</li>
            <li> Be prepared that it will take a week or so to get a white smile.</li>
            <li> Overnight will not work for me, and doesn&#x27;t seem safe, since I left the 15% in too long, maybe 45 minutes accidently</li>
            <li> My teeth gums were super sensitive the following day</li>
            <li> After a while it does turn a bit more stiff though.</li>
            <li> They are still  not chalk white, but they are a creamy white that suits my complexion just fine.  </li>
            <li> Obviously, you want to use enough that the full outer surface of the tooth comes in contact with the gel, but not so much that it squishes all over your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered eight refills and I have used four, so I have a new pack when I need to whiten again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also remove the trays, clean the overage on gums (carefully)</li>
            <li> There are many un-similarities found on packages and this product bought from Green Dot Sales doesn&#x27;t work at all in whitening but leaving my teeth over sensitive.</li>
            <li> You can tell very clearly by looking at the front teeth versus the ones just beyond the whitening tray.</li>
            <li> Very clear results.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth, and I had no issues using this product.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> Only need to whiten every once a month or so after the first three of getting started.</li>
            <li> I am a first time bleacher and after reading several reviews I purchased the 20%.</li>
            <li> I ALWAYS notice other people&#x27;s teeth and think, IF ONLY they had the $ to do this how much better they would look...</li>
            <li> It came on time, the product is exactly what was pictured and my teeth are pearly white.  </li>
            <li> the same product at my dentist&#x27;s office was 10x as much!</li>
            <li> Package arrived on time as promised and item was exactly as it was initially described.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> It whitens as well or better but no gums burned white or tooth sensitivity,  I was really surprised because I couldn&#x27;t even finish a week with the other stuff.</li>
            <li> stuff does burn (just like strips) if it gets on your gums, The spot between my two front upper teeth got burned pretty severely the 3rd time I applied (I used more than previous applications).  </li>
            <li> You want white teeth really quick and beautifully white.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used one tube of the 20% and they are super white!</li>
            <li> The 35% I used was so strong that the tiny amount that gets on your gums (no matter how careful you are) will burn a lot stronger than the 20%.</li>
            <li> I had this from my former dentist who was selling it the gel for twice the price (unknown to me), but then we moved, and my new dentist (now former) was charging more than 3 times the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and it is old old old.</li>
            <li> My daughter also used some in her clear retainers.</li>
            <li> mouth (too) sensitive</li>
            <li> I have used this brand before but it had been 35% which turned out to make my teeth uncomfortably sensitive.</li>
            <li> I used it about 3 times but had to stop as my teeth became too sensitive.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any issues with my gums hurting or teeth being sensitive...</li>
            <li> I love tea, so I need to brighten at least once a week.  </li>
            <li> I was told to refrigerate to have the product last longer, which seems to work, but you need to leave it out when you are ready to use.</li>
            <li> Seems like these were old because of the use instructions and probably sitting on a shelf.</li>
            <li> Leave it in overnight and does not make gums too sensitive.</li>
            <li> My dentist sells the complete kit for $225.  </li>
            <li> Got my whitening molds from my dentist (professionally made), then buy these here as it&#x27;s cheaper than buying from the dentist.</li>
            <li> Whitens without sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I got the trays from my dentist (professionally sized).</li>
            <li> I have used 2 syringes so far and no burned gums even if some lands on them.</li>
            <li> They will professionally make you a tray.</li>
            <li> Arrived early...</li>
            <li> save your money,it&#x27;s old and ineffective</li>
            <li> but my teeth are so sensitive that I they ache for hours after wearing the trays for 1 hour 1/2.</li>
            <li> i was getting these from my dentist after having my teeth professionally whitened....</li>
            <li> Put a drop directly on to each tooth then put your trays on.</li>
            <li> I just received my eight syringes and they were all marked O065</li>
            <li> Worked fast and my teeth are so white!</li>
            <li> so I was Sooo happily surprised that I didnt have to.</li>
            <li> DO NOT waste your money.</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of this product since it was first introduced int he market.</li>
            <li> We purchase the teeth whitening from you on a regular basis and find it much cheaper than our dentisit.</li>
            <li> It was a bit sensitive after 2 days</li>
            <li> Then depending on what you have left a 4 syringe pack should come close to maintaining your white smile by treating every 2-3 months.</li>
            <li> I had previously used the 15 percent stuff, but it didn&#x27;t do the trick as quickly as I wanted.  </li>
            <li> The dentist assistant said I probably wasn&#x27;t using the same product, but when I brought my Opalescence in, it was exactly the same as they were selling which they admitted.</li>
            <li> Let me state, this is the exact same brand my dentist has been selling me for years for upwards of $15 a syringe and only the !5% strength.  </li>
            <li> It brightens and whitens your teeth like no other!</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Tooth sensitivity is normal with use of this product initially.</li>
            <li> I stuck it out and the burn wore off after 2 or 3 minutes, but it was a pretty intense 2-3 minutes, and 3 days later that little area is still sensitive to touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and he said it was not active.</li>
            <li> so I might have even gone with a less powerful formula than the 20%  </li>
            <li> Watch out - you will have very sensitive teeth, especially the front teeth which thruout the day will &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> The only precaution I have is for people with very sensitive teeth should avoid stronger solutions  </li>
            <li> and there is no tingling and no sensitivity when before I have had major sensitivity, which means its not working.</li>
            <li> Works decent but they are not clear about putting fluoride in this.</li>
            <li> She said any of the Ultadent product sold via the web could be a risk to both your dental health as well as your general health.  </li>
            <li> look on the side of the clear plastic tubing on EACH individual tube.  </li>
            <li> It is in raised clear letters/numbers and is not obvious, you have to look closely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it since the end of May, and it&#x27;s barely made a difference.</li>
            <li> I was patient in waiting for pearly white results and my teeth still look like an old beaver&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in early 60&#x27;s doing it for last 3 yrs.</li>
            <li> You will notice a considerable difference of appearance in your teeth only after one week using the 20% solution.  </li>
            <li> Apparently this product was not what was advertised.  </li>
            <li> I bought opalescence 20% because the reviews of the 35% were scary(severe pain,bleached gums etc)The 20% has done nothing to whiten my teeth,I dont know if it is old or what, but I wish  that I had just bought Crest strips from my local store because they are always reliable.</li>
            <li> , the only downside vs strips is you can&#x27;t really go out in public with a whitening tray in your mouth (also unpleasant with strips but with the clear ones you can manage), however I find the tray to be more comfortable than strips, they move around on your teeth, the trays stay put and little to none of it gets in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Works great and less expensive.</li>
            <li> Some of the product seemed to have the same strength as the stuff sold but my dentist, but most of it was weak and did not lighten my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Be VERY CERTAIN that it doesn&#x27;t get applied too heavily or it will squish out ONTO your gums.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong enough to slowly whiten your teeth with no white spots.</li>
            <li> I bought the 20% and was a little reluctant at first because I do have sensitivity issues with my teeth.  </li>
            <li> is exactly the same product at half the price.</li>
            <li> Not useful at 20% even if you use it twice as much.</li>
            <li> Prime customers:pay the extra shipping, apparently that&#x27;s where the quality lies.</li>
            <li> Generally, the dentist or the veterinarian will be the MOST expensive place to find supplies and meds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works very well and much less than my dentist charges.</li>
            <li> I dry them, and then I put the product on my finger and directly to my teeth</li>
            <li> I then went on-line to see about getting the product for less and much to my surprise</li>
            <li> The CS rep that I spoke with said they only sell to dentist offices and never to the general public.  </li>
            <li> This was the first time I ordered from Green Dot Sales, and it will be the last!</li>
            <li> This product works great even for sensitive teeth (use it everyother day), less expensive then purchasing it directly from my dentist as I have in the past.</li>
            <li> You would think this would work at least a little better than Crest white strips.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used a little over 1 syringe approximately 6 hours in 3 applications each to both top and bottom.</li>
            <li> Some honest reviewers do not understand what a product is for or how to use it and will trash a product simply because they are just plain dumb.</li>
            <li> There is a slight amount of sensitivity to hot/cold for a day or two, but that doesn&#x27;t last long, nor is it very bothersome.</li>
            <li> My teeth get SUPER sensitive when whitening, however, so I have to go at it real slow.  </li>
            <li> Does not make my teeth as sensitive as other whitening products.</li>
            <li> Not sure it is legit as I haven&#x27;t necessarily noticed much of a difference.</li>
            <li> If your teeth are sensitive get only 20% or less and brush with Sensodyne before and after whitening.</li>
            <li> so you have to have previously purchased the complete kit or have invisalign trays or similar.  </li>
            <li> Almost feels like brushing with a firm brush when I am actually using a very soft brush.  </li>
            <li> It took twice as long to get the same results as I had when purchased from dental office.</li>
            <li> only issue with the two-pack is that I have a ton left over, so unless you can handle massive doses of peroxide and want a smile that is reminiscent of lightning, plan on splitting it with a spouse, significant-other, friend, sibling, random stranger with yellow teeth...</li>
            <li> I only keep them in for 30 minutes, no longer or your teeth might be a little sensitive.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews from customers with similar stories, it seems like this company is trying to pass off bad product for good.</li>
            <li> Works well, no major irritation to my teeth or gums.</li>
            <li> That limited 30 minute window with 35% was too short.</li>
            <li> my teeth were a little sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and select the 20% as my gums are a little sensitive (my husband&lt;br /&gt;uses</li>
            <li> wore these overnight and found that my teeth were a little sensitive in the morning</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> My teeth are incredibly sensitive for 24 hours afterwards, and my gums bleed for a few days when I brush.  </li>
            <li> let me know how long to apply it.</li>
            <li> Of course, I expected it to since it is the same thing I used to buy from the dentist</li>
            <li> a few weeks as it makes my gums sensitive (they already are.)&lt;br /&gt;I use Sensodyne Whitening toothpaste as well.  </li>
            <li> WAY cheaper on Amazon then at the dentists office, I wish I would of thought about getting them on Amazon a long time ago.</li>
            <li> There is some minor discomfort with the gum line, but it went after 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Can only use every other night</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time if you are not a coffee or wine drinker!</li>
            <li> I have also tried other brands of bleach,but I always come back to the Opalescence.</li>
            <li> The product is obviously close to or past its&#x27; expiration date and barely works at all.</li>
            <li> I have done 8 applications thus far and see very little change in the color.  </li>
            <li> Will buy again even if more expensive than other brands bought previously for comparable amounts.</li>
            <li> my dentist recommended wearing the trays an hour each day at no more than a 20% strength for natural whitening &amp; safety.  </li>
            <li> The 20% strength is definitely the way to go for me--strong enough to do the job without making my gums raw.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years now and it has never let me down.  </li>
            <li> I highly suspect that these online purchases of gel are outdated and it takes DOUBLE the time to whiten - therefore, order the 8 pack .</li>
            <li> My teeth get a little sensitive so this seems to work for me, let them simmer down for a day in between bleaching.</li>
            <li> Only on my top teeth and was so disappointed, there isn&#x27;t a difference.</li>
            <li> I use to get this same product from my dentist several years ago and paid at least 3 to 4 times the price.</li>
            <li> However, be careful not to over-use.  </li>
            <li> Even if there&#x27;s a drop and you wipe it off the gums will be partially burned.</li>
            <li> You will have to treat you teeth every few months to keep them white.</li>
            <li> I had spent $700 getting trays and a puny amount of gels.</li>
            <li> Be careful and check with your dentist before making a purchase.  </li>
            <li> I do sleep with the product on my teeth and my lower gums have become tender from the extended period of use (but I expected it).  </li>
            <li> While my teeth got a few shades whiter, they did not get noticably white.  </li>
            <li> Have seen minimal improvement in my teeth..</li>
            <li> I ordered from this company (they went by Green Dot, but I think they have several names) because it was cheaper than buying from my dentist.  </li>
            <li> I hope you can avoid the same waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery and product as expected</li>
            <li> This is much less expensive and exactly the same thing.  </li>
            <li> Not strong enough.  </li>
            <li> Solution seemed weak and did not whiten in the same manner and in the same time period that a previous order of the same strength (from another retailer) did.</li>
            <li> A little does go a long way and too much causes unnecessary discomfort to the gums.  </li>
            <li> This is the same product I got from my dentist for less than half what he charged.  </li>
            <li> Out of curiosity I checked Amazon and found the same product for less than half the price.</li>
            <li> Keeps my teeth looking super white, and way less expensive than Crest strips!</li>
            <li> I can say that I saw some improvement after the first usage (nothing like the crazy white &amp;#34;:Grey&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands of whitening gel</li>
            <li> Other &amp;#34;reviewers&amp;#34; will give products - that they have never seen and never used - glowing 5 star ratings - for a fee.  </li>
            <li> I use it every other night, the 20%.</li>
            <li> One stick has enough product to use one to three applications--only a small amount is needed each application; like a dot of the product for each tooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Can&#x27;t be too careful when it&#x27;s a product you put in your mouth!</li>
            <li> Do not exceed that time or you will experience extreme discomfort and sensitivity.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve also burned my gums in the past, turned white!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the other reviewers are seeing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other whitening products but they do not compare to this one.</li>
            <li> This product caused me extreme discomfort.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying this is the only place I could find to lay waste to the seller of this Item, Green Dot Sales.</li>
            <li> Not only that, the impressions blend in and it is hard to tell teeth from gum lines at times with the boil version.</li>
            <li> The product I received was definitely NOT fresh.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that sometimes in the morning</li>
            <li> (Forget wearing this overnight - I&#x27;d probably wake up and never smile again).  </li>
            <li> I know what the results are supposed to be like as I&#x27;ve ordered through my dentist and also on-line previously</li>
            <li> I did experience some sensitivity along my gum line as indicated from previous feed backs.  </li>
            <li> Leave on an hour to an hour an a half</li>
            <li> Previously was using a 10% NuPro solution - no problems in bumping to 20%, no sensitivity issues.</li>
            <li> Had to wait a couple weeks to try again, at which point I used MUCH less.  </li>
            <li> Read the internet reviews and start with less than you think you need.</li>
            <li> I am a previous user of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At one time is half of the syringe.</li>
            <li> The strength (20%) is less than what I got from my dentist</li>
            <li> My gums tingled a little bit after doing the 20 percent overnight.  </li>
            <li> I was a little leery about purchasing this online.</li>
            <li> I have been using contrast pm but wanted to try this because it is a little cheaper.  </li>
            <li> , It was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s old, exposed to heat or a copy, but I&#x27;m sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> I did not heed to the innumerable reviews stating that Green Dot was selling expired goods; or in my case, goods without an expiration date.</li>
            <li> Their product is dead by the time it gets to you.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t waste the product....</li>
            <li> I leave the gel and forms on for a few hours doing</li>
            <li> , otherwise you waste a lot of jel.</li>
            <li> Also I have had less sensitivity with this brand than the Zoom!</li>
            <li> Much less expensive than local dentist is charging.</li>
            <li> This is stronger than the formula I got from my dentist, and I burned my gums badly the first use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fake and I&#x27;m filing a claim with the Attorney General.</li>
            <li> It don&#x27;t work for me and my teeth just needed to be a little whiter!</li>
            <li> Very little sensitivity (I did skip a day after each all night use).</li>
            <li> I used just a small amount</li>
            <li> My trays usually hold the whitening gel for 30 minutes or so</li>
            <li> Small price to pay though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not sure when I refill</li>
            <li> Now I use no more than once or twice a week, and in the evening b4 bed.</li>
            <li> I had zoom whitening done in the past, and I used the trays from that with this gel.</li>
            <li> Had tried the opalescence pf 15% in the past....</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> It just takes some time getting used to how to apply the product so that it&#x27;s not touching your gums ( which will get irritated and inflamed if product sits on gums).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s potency because it is past the expiration day....</li>
            <li> I usually whiten my teeth overnight and skip a day in between.</li>
            <li> I wear it usually during the night.</li>
            <li> Very messy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this product 5 stars because I know from past use that it works, the batch I received has two years before it expires, and it&#x27;s hella cheap compared to the outrageous price my dentist charged me!</li>
            <li> Really disappointed and a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re not supposed to swallow any of this product which is hard to do if you&#x27;re wearing it while you sleep as they advise.</li>
            <li> I learned the hard way 6 years ago.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Also, for those who complained about the lack of instructions, well-</li>
            <li> And at least in my case, the sensitivity was temporary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So probably at least 5 hours a night</li>
            <li> This product was dried out and probably outdated, but nowhere could I find the expiration date.  </li>
            <li> The texture is really thick and gel like.</li>
            <li> I would take it slow</li>
            <li> AND THEY SAID THEY WONT GIVE ME THE OTHER!!!!</li>
            <li> For example, A055 would mean an expiration date of May 2015.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I keep it on approximately 4-6 hours a day (usually in the evening) with no problem.</li>
            <li> This product was so much less expensive than compared to what my Dentist charges for it.</li>
            <li> It was MUCH less expensive to buy on Amazon.</li>
            <li> they seem to be weak compared to what they were  a year ago</li>
            <li> I. thought I&#x27;d just tough it out</li>
            <li> Totally useless to me and in such bad shape.</li>
            <li> SO I ONLY GOT 4 STUPID WHITENING THINGS</li>
            <li> I might be crazy but the tubes fell apart, the green bottoms came off and things spilled out all over.</li>
            <li> From what I read the gel can get behind the invisalign buttons</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with these as compared with others I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> so they seem to be hiding behind emails.  </li>
            <li> Beware of outdated product possibilities.  </li>
            <li> I would have to agree with all other bad reviews - this product does not work.</li>
            <li> this SUCKS!!</li>
            <li> They must have sent me a stale batch.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a fake ... ???</li>
            <li> These appear to be fake, or expired.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical after reading some of the reviews others have posted about purchasing teeth bleach online rather than from my dentist.  </li>
            <li> (I couldn&#x27;t find one on this product by the way) or it is a fake.  </li>
            <li> My dentist gave me this product, but the cost of refills through his office as way too expensive.  </li>
            <li> Also, the pain made it unpleasant.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hopefully, this was just a bad batch.</li>
            <li> but it also has a de-sensitivity agent so you don&#x27;t feel it as bad.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I HATE THIS STUPID SHIPPER</li>
            <li> It works but annoying to spread onto mold.</li>
            <li> This stuff works well without burning the crap out of your gums.  </li>
            <li> so I am very disappointed and won&#x27;t use this distributor.</li>
            <li> tastes nasty, no improvement.</li>
            <li> But the packaging was awful.</li>
            <li> But the cost (from the dentist) of the Opalescence 20% and 35% is outrageous.</li>
            <li> Worst of it is my gum hurt afterward and</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great customer service.  Item as described and in original packaging.  Fast shipment. Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Good product. After 2 to 3 uses you see a significant difference. You need to use over night.</li>
            <li> Have used for years, and works great as always. 20% strength is perfect for me since it is strong as I can take without burning my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product was fresh and worked fine.</li>
            <li> If you want the strength that allows you to be done in 30 minutes you need the 30%. Otherwise you&#x27;ll have to keep it in for 6-8 hours. You&#x27;re not supposed to swallow any of this product which is hard to do if you&#x27;re wearing it while you sleep as they advise.</li>
            <li> Great product with good results.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and it is old old old. Very gummy, no taste and does nothing from the minute I got it. There is no expiration date on the syringe or package though. I guess buyer beware, It was a waste of money for me. No stars from me.</li>
            <li> i tried this on a recomendation from someone and it worked great.. really liked it, i&#x27;ve used others in the past and found this whitener for the money works really good</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and it works great.  So happy it is available online as I used to purchase it from my dentist &amp; paid more for the product</li>
            <li> Syringes are easy to use to load tooth trays. The 20% strength did not cause sensitivity, which was my primary concern before trying the product. I used just a small amount and it&#x27;s effective - Certainly less than 1/2 syringe, and more like only 1/4 was sufficient, per the written instructions included in the packaging.</li>
            <li> This product works just like the ones that I used to get from my dentist, but at a much lower price.</li>
            <li> same stuff I was getting from my dentist for 100$ more</li>
            <li> mouth (too) sensitive</li>
            <li> This is great product, and can&#x27;t beat the price.  I&#x27;ve used other brands of whitening gel but I prefer Opalescence.</li>
            <li> I first used this when my dentist made a mold of my teeth so they could be whitened. I found these replacements at Amazon and they are SO much cheaper than what I was paying the dentist. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand before but it had been 35% which turned out to make my teeth uncomfortably sensitive. The 20% was just as effective without the extreme sensitivity. I would definitely use this again.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I expected.  It came in a timely fashion, thank you, and I was very pleased with the product.  I would definitely order again from this seller.</li>
            <li> this product runs out so quick, and it did not seem fresh. tastes nasty, no improvement. i will never buy again.</li>
            <li> Works great!  What my dentist charged me $100 for!</li>
            <li> I love opalescence and everytime I order it, they send the product immediately.  They are very reliable!</li>
            <li> Great product that is cheaper here than through the dentist.  Packaging was very good.  Can only use every other night (I put in custom made mouth piece and go to sleep with it in) for about 5 nights.</li>
            <li> I used it about 3 times but had to stop as my teeth became too sensitive. Did a fairly good job whitening but I need to do more just waiting because of the sensitivity. My prior experience was with whitener from my dentist. It was 16% compared to the 20% strength of the Opalescence. Didn&#x27;t think it would make that much difference sensitivity wise.</li>
            <li> I put this gel in my retainers for about an hour at a time, maybe once or twice a month. Keeps my teeth looking super white, and way less expensive than Crest strips!</li>
            <li> I used the 10% before overnight! 20% will burn your gums overnight!</li>
            <li> Okay - so I typically buy the Rembrant teeth whitening trays for $20 from Target and figured I would give these a whirl. They work great. The product was on time, I keep them in the fridge and have had no problem.  Good for keeping your teeth looking white.  I didn&#x27;t have any issues with my gums hurting or teeth being sensitive...but that is just me. I will definitely purchase again...</li>
            <li> Love Opalescense.  It is the best teeth whitener.</li>
            <li> work well and was reasonable priced.</li>
            <li> I guess it works.. I love tea, so I need to brighten at least once a week.  I wore this product for 5 hours and didn&#x27;t notice a change in the shade of my teeth.  I like the one I bought from my dental clinic better.  It works in a shorter amount of time and the results are more noticeable.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and as described 100%</li>
            <li> Really good - I like the mint flavor</li>
            <li> The product came with an expiration date of 2008.  The gel still works, but takes longer than the gel I bought at the dentist&#x27;s office with an advanced date of expiration.</li>
            <li> Every sense I got my first whitening gels from the doctors office I have been purchasing refills through Amazon.  Great price, and great product for keeping your teeth white.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working as intended. I&#x27;ve only just started but I can tell they are working cause I can feel it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it really works.  Had the molds made at a dentist&#x27;s office and the whitener cost a fortune there.  The 20% solution works the best for me and doesn&#x27;t bother my gums.  My teeth have never been whiter.</li>
            <li> I like it and and it is doing a great job</li>
            <li> Good value for the price and much lower than buying in the dentist office.  I was told to refrigerate to have the product last longer, which seems to work, but you need to leave it out when you are ready to use.</li>
            <li> This is where we buy our bleach. Works great and less expensive.</li>
            <li> i have purchased these AGAIN. the price is definitely right and they work. I love smiling when my teeth are white :)</li>
            <li> My last set of Opalescence was PF 15%.  I like this better, works faster.  Wear it overnight and can see the difference in the morning.</li>
            <li> I used it before, it&#x27;s working and it&#x27;s much cheaper than in dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Have used many tubes of this product. It works just as well as getting teeth bleached by a dentist, the same product my dentist used and way cheaper to buy it yourself. It&#x27;s well worth the time and money.</li>
            <li> I really like this product . I would recommend it to all people I know. It seemed to whiten without hurting my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I have used Opalescence with my bleaching trays for many years and I feel that I know what to expect from the results. The product I received was definitely NOT fresh. Really disappointed and a complete waste of money. Do not buy from this seller.</li>
            <li> I have been using Opalescence for many, many years. I love the consistency in quality and especially the results! My teeth look naturally bright and healthy. I use the 20% overnight.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as what I get at my dentist only cheaper.  Like a gel that I can sleep in; think it makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I purchased trays and Opalescence 20% whitening gel from my dentist. My instructions were to apply the gel to the trays (sparingly) and then wear the trays for 90 minutes a day for two weeks without skipping days.  My teeth are no longer yellow.  The product works.  I did experience some discomfort and sensitivity around my gum line and in my teeth but it is nothing that is intolerable.  I would not try a stronger strength of the gel.  My dentist gave me a toothpaste to use to help with the sensitivity and it has helped.  I believe it is important to follow the instructions of the dentist with regard to the amount of gel that is applied to the whitening trays.  A little does go a long way and too much causes unnecessary discomfort to the gums.  The product and this method of tooth whitening is effective but you need to be patient and diligent.  I purchased more gel for future touch ups from an Amazon.com vendor because it was more cost effective than purchasing more gel from the dentist.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by my most excellent dentist. It works great. My dentist recommends this PF 20% strength one. I recommend you also stick with this strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have decided to add the following to all my reviews:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware! Some &amp;#34;reviewers&amp;#34; will trash a product for no reason simply because they are paid to or because they sell competitive products. Other &amp;#34;reviewers&amp;#34; will give products - that they have never seen and never used - glowing 5 star ratings - for a fee.  Some honest reviewers do not understand what a product is for or how to use it and will trash a product simply because they are just plain dumb.</li>
            <li> Works as good as the dentists does</li>
            <li> Works well, no major irritation to my teeth or gums.</li>
            <li> This does not whiten like the  Opalescence PF 20% I bought from my dentist or from a dental website. I&#x27;ve been using it since the end of May, and it&#x27;s barely made a difference. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s old, exposed to heat or a copy, but I&#x27;m sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> These are great!!  I have noticed an immediate whitening​ of my teeth and now use it once a week to maintain, I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> These work really well, also a lot cheaper then at the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying this is the only place I could find to lay waste to the seller of this Item, Green Dot Sales. I did not heed to the innumerable reviews stating that Green Dot was selling expired goods; or in my case, goods without an expiration date. I waited a long while to write this review to make sure it didn&#x27;t work. I was patient in waiting for pearly white results and my teeth still look like an old beaver&#x27;s. Amazon was awesome and promptly refunded my purchase, Don&#x27;t be fooled, Green Dot sucks. Prime customers:pay the extra shipping, apparently that&#x27;s where the quality lies.</li>
            <li> Works decent but they are not clear about putting fluoride in this. Only when I looked at the actual syringe did I see they put that poison in Opalescence. Make sure you read the ingredients in any tooth whitening system if you&#x27;re avoiding fluoride.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work.  I used two tubes already and my teeth don&#x27;t even change one bit.  I have use this brand before with great success.  They must have sent me a stale batch.</li>
            <li> I have used opalescence for years and love the product. I appreciate the selection variety as well. My dentist charges twice what I can purchase this for on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Way too strong, it will burn your gums.</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does not have the taste of mint as a product that I know the dentist&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked under the microscope descriptions on the syringe, they are very similar but in English !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I think it&#x27;s a fake ... ???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not see color change either !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not know if it serves a purpose to continue !!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m afraid of damaging my teeth are very healthy .... !!!</li>
            <li> Works really well - but you have to use a lot of the gel for it to work.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find an expiration date anywhere on the product. I&#x27;ve bought this product from my dentist before, however this didn&#x27;t seem as strong to me.</li>
            <li> You would think this would work at least a little better than Crest white strips.  Doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Somewhat strong, so I only end up using for 3 hours tops, other wise my teeth get too sensitive. The taste could be better but it whitens very well and it lasts! Only need to whiten every once a month or so after the first three of getting started. Last Forever since it is refrigerated! Great product!</li>
            <li> I actually wouldn&#x27;t even put 1 star cause this SUCKS!! I got it on time but I really don&#x27;t care about that I wanted my teeth whitened and it didn&#x27;t work!!!! not only did it not work..... I ONLY GOT 1 PACK NOT 2 JUST 1 FRICKEN PACK!! SO I ONLY GOT 4 STUPID WHITENING THINGS AND THEY SAID THEY WONT GIVE ME THE OTHER!!!! WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO AMAZON AND SHT!! GOSH I HATE THIS STUPID SHIPPER PERSON!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DONT BUY IT!!</li>
            <li> Great product and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Whitens gently. Just keep it off your gums! I have very sensitive teeth, and I had no issues using this product. Much better deal than purchasing at the dentist.</li>
            <li> Received promptly!  Product is fresh and works amazingly.  I will purchase again.  The price is much more reasonable than getting it from my dentist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had yellow teeth since forever.  The first time I used Opalescence  tooth whitener I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT!!  I still am astounded at the improvement.  SO far superior to the bleaching I had at the dentist some years back for $400. I use it every other night, the 20%. Started about 2 weeks ago.  My teeth get a little sensitive so this seems to work for me, let them simmer down for a day in between bleaching. I have actually gone for days in between bleaching and the results just hang in there.  But WOW I tell you this is the real deal - if you have &amp;#34;tried everything&#x27;&#x27; , you haven&#x27;t until you have tried this one! I honestly thought I would never have white teeth.  They are still  not chalk white, but they are a creamy white that suits my complexion just fine.  AND people have been noticing :).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product (Opalescence 20%) for years. This was the first time I ordered from Green Dot Sales, and it will be the last! The product is obviously close to or past its&#x27; expiration date and barely works at all. I know what the results are supposed to be like as I&#x27;ve ordered through my dentist and also on-line previously so I am very disappointed and won&#x27;t use this distributor. Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Worked great! Great price.</li>
            <li> Loved the whitening gel!</li>
            <li> This tooth whitening solution is the best! It totally whitens my teeth in 3 uses!</li>
            <li> This is what you buy in most Dental Practices to whiten your teeth when you have custom teeth trays. If your teeth are sensitive get only 20% or less and brush with Sensodyne before and after whitening. Its the next best thing to the immediate in office procedure that costs a whole lot more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the 20% gel 3 times now for 3 hours each time, and my teeth are definitely whiter!  I can only use it once a week though because it hurts.  My teeth are incredibly sensitive for 24 hours afterwards, and my gums bleed for a few days when I brush.  (If your trays fit properly, you might not have issues with your gums burning.  I&#x27;m using Invisalign trays, which isn&#x27;t recommended.)</li>
            <li> I have been purcasing this product from my dentist but although it was supposedly the the same 20% strength; it actually seems more like 10% but the price was good.</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve got your own trays, the Opalescence PF 20% teeth whitening syringes are very quick &amp; easy to use.  They also work. I used my trays for 2-3 hours per day for 3 days.  After that, I left them in all night. Very little sensitivity (I did skip a day after each all night use). And the results are very noticeable.  I will definitely use the product again in another 6 months or so.</li>
            <li> First off. My trays usually hold the whitening gel for 30 minutes or so and this recommends 4-6 hours!!! or 8 overnight. If you get 35% it said 30 minutes. I might be crazy but the tubes fell apart, the green bottoms came off and things spilled out all over. Seems like these were old because of the use instructions and probably sitting on a shelf. I&#x27;d try to buy from a seller with a specialty in tooth whitening gels. I am NOT about to wear my tray for 3-6 hours. Totally useless to me and in such bad shape. They go in the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I requested refund, the seller acted quickly and issued a UPS pickup and a return receipt for home pickup. Made me very happy to see them stand behind their business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully, this was just a bad batch.</li>
            <li> Works very well and a great price.  I have been paying $20.00 for one tube at the dentist&#x27;s office;  This is much less expensive and exactly the same thing.  I have used this bleach for over 10 years and found it to be very effective.  No problems with it at all.</li>
            <li> This was the brand used by my dentist when I had my trays made. It works well. Leave it in overnight and does not make gums too sensitive.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  Thank you for fast shipping!</li>
            <li> The extra 5 percent was just what I needed.  I had previously used the 15 percent stuff, but it didn&#x27;t do the trick as quickly as I wanted.  The 20 percent got it done in one night, although next time I use it I might consider doing it during the day for 4 or 5 hours, rather than 8 hours overnight.  My gums tingled a little bit after doing the 20 percent overnight.  Anyway, great product when used correctly.  When I run out I&#x27;ll order the same stuff again.</li>
            <li> I noticed that the Amazon purchase-Opalescence PF 20% Teeth Whitening- didn&#x27;t have the same outcome as the product I purchased from my dentist.  After reading several reviews that indicated the same results, I decided to call Ultradent to ask about the product they manufacture. The CS rep that I spoke with said they only sell to dentist offices and never to the general public.  She said any of the Ultadent product sold via the web could be a risk to both your dental health as well as your general health.  I have trashed the unused product.</li>
            <li> Whitened teeth as stated with no discomfort to my gums. The packaging is not the most convenient - it keeps the tubes together, but they can easily fall out of the holder.</li>
            <li> same for this comment as well.  Haven&#x27;t used yet, but if you will ask me in 30 days I&#x27;ll report back.</li>
            <li> Not strong enough.  Opalescence is a great product but bump up on the percentage.  Not useful at 20% even if you use it twice as much.</li>
            <li> Dentist wanted to charge me 25$ per syringe of this and after going to amazon I saw this amazing product. This works amazingly well and am still using it till this day.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast. I didn&#x27;t feel the product was working. I&#x27;ve used this product for 10+ yrs. I had a dentist check it out and he said it was not active.</li>
            <li> Very good product, and price</li>
            <li> I had to order these after buying the 35%...this is what I used to get from my dentist for $15 a syringe...my smile is bright again</li>
            <li> Product works as posted</li>
            <li> This product was dried out and probably outdated, but nowhere could I find the expiration date.  Beware of outdated product possibilities.  Unusable.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, my dentist gave this to me a year ago and I have been using it since. Gets my bottom teeth white and its easy to use. Better than store bought whiteners and cost about the same. Would recommend to anyone wanting to whiten their teeth.</li>
            <li> My dentist sells the complete kit for $225.  After some research and feedback from Amazoners I went with this smallest kit to test results. This kit does not have trays so you have to have previously purchased the complete kit or have invisalign trays or similar.  The instructions indicate to follow directions from your dentist but a brief instruction card is included.  My first application developed immediate results.  A second application the following day also produced noticeable results.  I did experience some sensitivity along my gum line as indicated from previous feed backs.  This is most noticeable during brushing.  Almost feels like brushing with a firm brush when I am actually using a very soft brush.  I definitely recommend this product to anyone with a desire to improve their smile.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fake and I&#x27;m filing a claim with the Attorney General. Who knows what is really in this product. Opalescence is ONLY sold at the dentist!!!</li>
            <li> Works!  Why buy it from the dentist!</li>
            <li> I used opalescence 20. Only on my top teeth and was so disappointed, there isn&#x27;t a difference. I read another review where a lady had the same problem. I also had it on my gums for 2 hours and there is no tingling and no sensitivity when before I have had major sensitivity, which means its not working. Opalescence is good but don&#x27;t buy from this company green dot.  Their product is dead by the time it gets to you. I don&#x27;t know if they aren&#x27;t keeping it in the right temperature or shipping it correctly but this opalescence is ineffective. Try a different company.</li>
            <li> Really works well.Only used it over night.Wouldn&#x27;t recommend any stronger than 20%.Already have the plastic tooth plates from years ago.Don&#x27;t have to use it often.</li>
            <li> Always effective and easy to use.  It definitely whitens and more effective than other whiteners.  Can conduct activities while engaging in normal activities.</li>
            <li> The product works great and I can definitely see the difference in my teeth...so much whiter.  Thanks for a great value on an exceptional product!!</li>
            <li> I love using these jells they really do work. I had a tray made for my mouth by my dentist and use this inside it and within two weeks my teeth are literally three to four shades whiter! It lasts a long time if you are not a coffee or wine drinker! I think I do my teeth twice a year. This is the best deal I found for these, you get two for the price of one!</li>
            <li> This product is great and cost so much less than what you pay if you get it from your dentist. You will need to have a mold of your teeth.  I had this from my former dentist who was selling it the gel for twice the price (unknown to me), but then we moved, and my new dentist (now former) was charging more than 3 times the price. The dentist assistant said I probably wasn&#x27;t using the same product, but when I brought my Opalescence in, it was exactly the same as they were selling which they admitted. This product is so easy to use and you only need to have on your teeth for 1 hour.  The first time I used it, I used all 4 sticks to get to the whiteness I needed. Now every one or months, I use one stick and it keeps my teeth white.  One stick has enough product to use one to three applications--only a small amount is needed each application; like a dot of the product for each tooth.</li>
            <li> I use to get this same product from my dentist several years ago and paid at least 3 to 4 times the price. It works great and I found that the 20% was the highest % I could go to not bother my teeth as much.</li>
            <li> Works well. It would be nice if it came with directions let me know how long to apply it.</li>
            <li> This product was so much less expensive than compared to what my Dentist charges for it.</li>
            <li> The stuff works. The only negative is that sometimes in the morning my teeth were a little sensitive. Small price to pay though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife uses it too, her experience with it is the same as mine.</li>
            <li> I had custom trays done at my dentists office &amp; initially purchased 10% syringes there. The staff gave me the BEST TIP so I am passing to all of you...buy a cheap fine eyeliner brush at your local CVS or Walmart and apply the gel from the syringe to the brush &amp; paint it onto the surfaces of the teeth you want to whiten- then put on your trays and wear for an hour.  First- it doesn&#x27;t waste the product....Second- it doesn&#x27;t get on your gums to cause sensitivity or burning.  And yes- my dentist recommended wearing the trays an hour each day at no more than a 20% strength for natural whitening &amp; safety.  And he is right...the brush works beautifully- product lasts a very long time- &amp; my teeth are bright but not unnaturally white.  I just bought the 20% from him.  I am not sure when I refill If I will purchase here unless I call the company to confirm it is the same product.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t be too careful when it&#x27;s a product you put in your mouth!</li>
            <li> This product is truly effective.  It is comfortable to wear and depending upon your individual limitations, it is possible to wear Opalescence for an extended period (hours) with no ill effects and great results.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Opalescence before and had great results, however with this batch I did not notice much whitening at all. Disappointed. There is a shelf life. Even though I questioned this, the distributor said they were witching the expiration date. Just saying I noticed diminished results!</li>
            <li> This product was shipped in a timely manner and is the real deal. I would recommend this product for people who have been using the product via their dentist and need refills. Thanks!</li>
            <li> just like the DDS office has</li>
            <li> Woo-Hoo...........Works great.  However, be careful not to over-use.  I was using every eve (leaving on overnite) for an entire week.  Watch out - you will have very sensitive teeth, especially the front teeth which thruout the day will &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34;.  Now I use no more than once or twice a week, and in the evening b4 bed.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! I had zoom whitening done in the past, and I used the trays from that with this gel. Simply cover your teeth, apply the tray, go to sleep, and wake up with amazingly white teeth! :D There is a slight amount of sensitivity to hot/cold for a day or two, but that doesn&#x27;t last long, nor is it very bothersome. I swear by this stuff, and refuse to use any of the whitening strips etc. because those just hurt so much. These are pain free and will make you look great!</li>
            <li> Product came on time and was exactly as advertised. The 20% syringes are to be used for 2-4 hours. Do not exceed that time or you will experience extreme discomfort and sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. I strongly recommend it and you will love it too. I am very happy with it because its very good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried stronger percent whiteners that end up burning my gums.  This product is weaker, but I can tolerate it for much longer and achieve whiteness. It also tastes good.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal, and for a great deal.  My teeth get SUPER sensitive when whitening, however, so I have to go at it real slow.  (Forget wearing this overnight - I&#x27;d probably wake up and never smile again).  It&#x27;s no fault of the product - my teeth just seem to be extra sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue with the two-pack is that I have a ton left over, so unless you can handle massive doses of peroxide and want a smile that is reminiscent of lightning, plan on splitting it with a spouse, significant-other, friend, sibling, random stranger with yellow teeth...you get the idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff - buy it and get whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> This works really well. I have very sensitive teeth so I might have even gone with a less powerful formula than the 20%  but after 1x 4hrs my teeth were significantly whiter and after the 2nd time..my teeth were at the level  i wanted. You can use 1 tube for 2 bleaching sessions.</li>
            <li> After just two applications, can definitely see results.  Easy to uses with trays I had from set up my dentist gave me.  I&#x27;m an avid coffee drinker and this has already brightened my smile.</li>
            <li> I am a first time bleacher and after reading several reviews I purchased the 20%. Next time I will do the 35%.</li>
            <li> Fantastic results in 30 mins, better then having a detest to it.</li>
            <li> Works just fine.  Of course, I expected it to since it is the same thing I used to buy from the dentist</li>
            <li> Great service! Very pleased with my product!</li>
            <li> can see some results after using.</li>
            <li> I use this often. Great price and it does the trick well. Got my whitening molds from my dentist (professionally made), then buy these here as it&#x27;s cheaper than buying from the dentist.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but the stronger formula works faster. However, I&#x27;ve also burned my gums in the past, turned white! So went back to the slower way lesser %. Be VERY CERTAIN that it doesn&#x27;t get applied too heavily or it will squish out ONTO your gums. You&#x27;ll feel it. Gums turn white. Use a Q-tip swab in water to get if off. I&#x27;ve also remove the trays, clean the overage on gums (carefully) don&#x27;t want to remove from teeth however, then do the tray cleaning where it&#x27;s oozed out. Only that part.  Reinsert and leave them in. I normally do it before bed and sleep with them in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always get compliments that I have a nice smile and WHITE teeth, especially the day after using it for touch up. I&#x27;m in early 60&#x27;s doing it for last 3 yrs. They aren&#x27;t knock out white but certainly much whiter than most people my age. I ALWAYS notice other people&#x27;s teeth and think, IF ONLY they had the $ to do this how much better they would look... Sadly, many don&#x27;t even notice their smile in the mirror. It takes years off of you. Oh, I&#x27;ve been in divorce court for 4 yrs. :D pearly whites smiling!</li>
            <li> The stuff worked pretty good. But the packaging was awful. 3 of the 8 syringes where cracked and leaked all over and I had to throw them away</li>
            <li> Whitens without sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> Great whitener at a great price!!!!</li>
            <li> I just received it today and I am so looking forward to see the changes. Love the taste. My teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li> I got the trays from my dentist (professionally sized). But the cost (from the dentist) of the Opalescence 20% and 35% is outrageous. I would advise anyone to pay the dentist for the professionally fitted trays, then for the Whitening Product of choice one can get that on amazon at a huge dollar savings.</li>
            <li> My local dentist wanted $90 for the 2 tubes sold here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;20% is a great concentration because I can leave it on overnight with no sensitivity issues.  Try a the different ones that you initially get with your trays and see which on works best for you.  Then instead of getting more gel from your dentist, just order it from Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing price for shiny, white teeth how can you not purchase some?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full Disclosure: You will need to have custom made trays made for your teeth in order to use this product.</li>
            <li> I started my invisalign journey about four weeks ago. When I got my trays the assistant told me I could whiten while I&#x27;m straightening my teeth. I had bought some 35% opalescence before I started invisalign. I do not recommend the 35%. The 35% causes a lot more zingers (2-6 second pain in deep treated cavities), it burns your gums if the gel gets on them, and the whitening had almost no power in my case. That limited 30 minute window with 35% was too short. I used 3 syringes and only saw 1 shade brighter. Also, the pain made it unpleasant. The zingers hurt and caused some sensitivity for a day afterwards. Also, the gel was so strong if any gel got on the gums you are done. Even if there&#x27;s a drop and you wipe it off the gums will be partially burned. Depending on your tray there may be some gel that ends up on the corner between teeth. That will turn that part of the gum white and burned. The white part goes away after an hour or so, but your brush will remind you of that mistake for 3-4 days. After all this, I decide to switch to the 20%. Talk about a night and day difference. I have used 2 syringes so far and no burned gums even if some lands on them. Still want to wipe it off, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt on contact like the 35%. The whitening power is amazing. I gain 1.5 shades easy per treatment. Most of the time I get 2 shades. I do get zingers, but the pain is 1/3 the level and only as I approach the 3.5 hour mark. If a zinger happens again five minutes apart I stop. I don&#x27;t have any lingering sensitivity. Make sure to have professional trays. You can get mold and mail to the dentist whitening trays on ebay for about $45 on ebay. They will professionally make you a tray. Don&#x27;t use the boil home use trays. I started off with before invisalign and I could never get a full impression. I was close, but it is hard to get it perfect on the front of the teeth. Not only that, the impressions blend in and it is hard to tell teeth from gum lines at times with the boil version. From what I read the gel can get behind the invisalign buttons so you shouldn&#x27;t have to whiten that much at the end of the treatment. Maybe once to even it up from what I read on a dentist forum. This will be my go to whitening from now on. Not only is it dentist grade, but it has floride for cavitiy/enamel protection but it also has a de-sensitivity agent so you don&#x27;t feel it as bad. You will have to treat you teeth every few months to keep them white. It would be a good idea to start with an 8 pack to guarantee you get the white results. Then depending on what you have left a 4 syringe pack should come close to maintaining your white smile by treating every 2-3 months. I found websites online that sell a tray and a 4 pack of opalescence for $400. This is dental quality people and the best you can get at this price. Be prepared that it will take a week or so to get a white smile. You will need to treat every day for 3-4 hours. If you have any sensitivity skip a day and then continue. I&#x27;ve only used two syringes of the 20% and I&#x27;ve jumped 6 shades. I&#x27;m only 1 shade away from being white. Another thing I read about whitening. There&#x27;s a limit to the white, once your white matches your eye you need to stop. Otherwise it starts look unnatural. The best part is I can do this during invisalign. I just waited until my overlapping teeth were spaced out enough I could touch the front of all my teeth and off I went whitening.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years now and it has never let me down.  This 20% blend has a longer application time, but it is more gentle on the teeth and gums than the 35% blend.  I also buy some 35% for quick tune ups between bleaching.</li>
            <li> Noticeable difference easy to use</li>
            <li> perfect - as advertised!</li>
            <li> Love this. always reorder. Works great on our entire family.No burning sensation.</li>
            <li> great product fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This is the same product I got from my dentist for less than half what he charged.  Works like a charm while I&#x27;m sleeping.</li>
            <li> love the ability to refill the whitening gel with the dentists mouth guard.  Works great; use over night every other day for several days.</li>
            <li> Dilever in the time and good quality.</li>
            <li> What is there to say. This is such a great purchase of this product as you cannot do any better for the price. The 20% solution is the right amount instead of using the 10% or the higher solution. You will notice a considerable difference of appearance in your teeth only after one week using the 20% solution.  My dentist sold me tubes of 10% and it took a much longer time to whiten. They cost me $10.00 a tube. The only precaution I have is for people with very sensitive teeth should avoid stronger solutions  but I believe over time and using  the stronger solution you will build up a tolerance for it.</li>
            <li> These are great, the 20% is too high for me; I prefer the 15% with less irritation. I will never pay a dentist for this again. I had spent $700 getting trays and a puny amount of gels. I like this brand better than Nuprogold. You can get trays at Walmart. I am lucky to have clear retainers. The dentist comments on how white my teeth are.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.also recommend great tasting opalescence toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Luv Opalescence PF 20%.  You want white teeth really quick and beautifully white.  This is your product. Leave on an hour to an hour an a half and you will beautifully white teeth.  I plan on tbuying this again when I run out.  Plus, delivery is very quick and to your door.  I use to buy this at the dentist and pay alot more money.  I dont have too anymore.  One stop shop here.</li>
            <li> It works...period. You can tell very clearly by looking at the front teeth versus the ones just beyond the whitening tray. Very clear results. Had some sensitivity originally (I sleep with them in), but just took a one day break and it was fine the next 3 days straight.</li>
            <li> Same stuff as my dentist used on me. Works perfectly</li>
            <li> Works very well and much less than my dentist charges.</li>
            <li> I had purchased some of these thru my dentist along with my custom mold.  It was MUCH less expensive to buy on Amazon. It really works great to whiten your teeth quickly. My daughter also used some in her clear retainers. Just caution not to get it on your gums because it can burn. Tooth sensitivity is normal with use of this product initially. So wear for a couple hours at first and work up to all night.  My teeth became remarkably whiter after just 3 days. highly recommended</li>
            <li> Whitens well but I agree there is some variance as to the strength. Overall, I would still use this product and think it&#x27;s a much better alternative to the dentist and their huge prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note: I am using a custom-made tray from my dentist. I really feel this makes a difference in the quality of whitening you get.</li>
            <li> The whitening gel is effective. In 1 week I started seeing results.  Currently approaching week 4.  Very happy with the product.  I did not experience any sensitivity pain from using the product.  I was initially concerned because there is no expiration date on the product.  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I was a little leery about purchasing this online. It&#x27;s powerful stuff, so I switch to Sensodyne toothpaste when using it. But it works well and I save money by purchasing it through Amazon. Stores well, too: after a year in my cupboard the syringes have maintained their efficacy.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful!!  Arrived early...packaging good...no complaints!</li>
            <li> Opalescence is an excellent product that is used by my dentist. The patient pays to have the trays made then you can begin the whitening process. It has given me confidence in my smile. Got rid of the yellow teeth. Well wirth the investment. Mary Ann</li>
            <li> I have used this before....with forms that my dentist had made to fit my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;  This product works great.  I leave the gel and forms on for a few hours doing&lt;br /&gt;work around the house and only one or two days. Then, I have to not use it&lt;br /&gt;for a few weeks as it makes my gums sensitive (they already are.)&lt;br /&gt;I use Sensodyne Whitening toothpaste as well.  As a tea lover and from eating&lt;br /&gt;lots of fruit including blueberries....all of this helps keep my smile bright and white.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand for 6 years. I still love it. If you already have a teeth tray, I reccommend this brand. I only keep them in for 30 minutes, no longer or your teeth might be a little sensitive. I learned the hard way 6 years ago. This is the go to gel for whitening. WAY cheaper on Amazon then at the dentists office, I wish I would of thought about getting them on Amazon a long time ago. Could of saved myself hundreds of dollars.</li>
            <li> Great product and good service every time!</li>
            <li> Works great! Has no taste which I enjoy. Previously was using a 10% NuPro solution - no problems in bumping to 20%, no sensitivity issues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used higher percentage bleach and this is the level that works best for me. The 35% I used was so strong that the tiny amount that gets on your gums (no matter how careful you are) will burn a lot stronger than the 20%.</li>
            <li> The 20% is WAY too strong.  Be careful and check with your dentist before making a purchase.  This item caused some damage to my gums but after speaking with my dentist and getting a special over the counter solution all is now back to normal.</li>
            <li> save your money,it&#x27;s old and ineffective</li>
            <li> Great product at an incredible price...much cheaper than buying from my dentist. Whitened teeth beautifully.  I store the remaining tubes in the refrigerator for touch-ups in the months to come. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It came on time, the product is exactly what was pictured and my teeth are pearly white.  What more could a girl want?</li>
            <li> I had only used the 10% before and had good luck with the product. When reordering I saw that the 8pk of 20% was cheaper so I ordered the 20%..Well it burned my gums the first two times I used it didn&#x27;t use it again for a while because of the burning. Decided to try again but this time I didn&#x27;t brush my teeth first and it didn&#x27;t burn so I&#x27;ve been using on a regular basic.&lt;br /&gt;No brush no burn,,,,Works Great!</li>
            <li> This is the product that my dentist gave me and I can buy them from him, but Amazon offers them at a better price.  I have different strengths for the different times that I plan to use them.  I sleep with the 20%.  Wake up in the morning with noticeably whiter teeth.  Excellent product at a good price.</li>
            <li> First purchased in the dentist office for several dollars more!  Found it on Amazon  at a much better price.  Excellent product highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  If you are looking for FAST results, use the 30 or 35% solution although you might experience son sensitivity as I did.  Using the 20% 1-2 time a week works great with no issues.</li>
            <li> This product does what it says it does. It totally Meets my expectations. I can&#x27;t say any more about it.</li>
            <li> Works great....I will re-order again! Had tried the opalescence pf 15% in the past....now I will order the 20%. great results</li>
            <li> Same as the stuff my dentist gave me...</li>
            <li> So far so good - but my teeth are so sensitive that I they ache for hours after wearing the trays for 1 hour 1/2. I can say that I saw some improvement after the first usage (nothing like the crazy white &amp;#34;:Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&amp;#34; teeth) - but happy to see some improvement. My teeth are pretty white naturally - so I may not have to suffer too much for beauty but be sure to buy a toothpaste for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand for years but I think the syringe quality has changed. The tip broke off immediately so the gel had to be squeezed through a blunt end. Very messy. Also, the syringes seem smaller. I used to be able to get 2 treatments out of one syringe, and now I can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I buy this product periodically. Love the way it works. Use at your own pace since the teeth will become sensitive if you overuse. Works for both me and my wife.</li>
            <li> We have use this product on a regular basis for a number of years.  It works very well.  Twenty percent can burn gums if too much is applied to the trays.</li>
            <li> Nice stuff. Works great even if only left on for 20-30 at a time every couple weeks. Does not make my teeth as sensitive as other whitening products. Will buy again even if more expensive than other brands bought previously for comparable amounts.</li>
            <li> These appear to be fake, or expired.  Do not purchase.</li>
            <li> This is stronger than the formula I got from my dentist, and I burned my gums badly the first use. Had to wait a couple weeks to try again, at which point I used MUCH less.  The price is good, but user beware.  Read the internet reviews and start with less than you think you need.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and as described.  The syringes are easy to use and are delivering results.  I would recommend this product to anyone interested in teeth whitening.</li>
            <li> You have to wear these over night.  I like the trays that you insert and throw away.  It is only 15% but you only leave in for 15 minutes.  Overnight will not work for me, and doesn&#x27;t seem safe, since I left the 15% in too long, maybe 45 minutes accidently and it burned my front gums, leaving them sore and white!  The green trays are great, just follow instructions</li>
            <li> I bought this before on Amazon. I had no sensitivity to the product however, this time the gel burns my gums.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cause sensitivity and is very sticky so your trays don&#x27;t move. I&#x27;ve used this before and it works after two or three sessions.</li>
            <li> Better than buyin from your Dentists office. It&#x27;s the same bleach. More than half the price.</li>
            <li> Works as described.  I did not expect much as my teeth need much, but this is good as i can see an improvement easier than most.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical after reading some of the reviews others have posted about purchasing teeth bleach online rather than from my dentist.  Let me state, this is the exact same brand my dentist has been selling me for years for upwards of $15 a syringe and only the !5% strength.  The product works great and you only need a little bit of the product in your custom molded trays to see a difference.  I noticed a huge difference just after two uses.  I do sleep with the product on my teeth and my lower gums have become tender from the extended period of use (but I expected it).  Product works if used correctly!</li>
            <li> Best cleaning system available.  You must purchase the teeth trays from your dentist to get a excellent fit. Yes, it&#x27;s costly, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> they seem to be weak compared to what they were  a year ago</li>
            <li> I have been using contrast pm but wanted to try this because it is a little cheaper.  It works but my teeth hurt more after this brand.  The texture is really thick and gel like.</li>
            <li> Fast, reliable recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> i was getting these from my dentist after having my teeth professionally whitened....i would refresh every 6 months when i had my 6 month cleaning....they charged $50 for one syringe.....now i can come on here and brighted as needed and i get a whole lot more......</li>
            <li> I have used this product before, but bought it at my dentist&#x27;s office.&lt;br /&gt;This is exactly the same product at half the price.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, my friend paid a dentist $400 to whiten her teeth with same treatment. Mine came out as well!  She know has me order her supply from Amazon!</li>
            <li> As comparing with my proscribed one from the dentist that works wonder. There are many un-similarities found on packages and this product bought from Green Dot Sales doesn&#x27;t work at all in whitening but leaving my teeth over sensitive.</li>
            <li> While my teeth got a few shades whiter, they did not get noticably white.  Not one person, including my wife, even noticed.</li>
            <li> Works great! If you have not bleached your teeth before you will have to use about four tubes to get the max results. If you have used bleach before, one or two times works for touching up. Put a drop directly on to each tooth then put your trays on. You do not want to make the drop to large or it overflows up into your gums and your gums will be sore for a couple days. I use to buy this same brand from my dentist for $30 for one tube.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for 10 years. I used to buy it from my dentist, love that I can buy it online instead. It works beautifully!</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and select the 20% as my gums are a little sensitive (my husband&lt;br /&gt;uses the stronger strength).  It&#x27;s a great product and one my dentist sells at at least twice the price,&lt;br /&gt;so buying it online (through Amazon) is the way to go.</li>
            <li> The 20% strength is definitely the way to go for me--strong enough to do the job without making my gums raw.</li>
            <li> Like many of the reviewers, I was concerned by the apparent lack of the expiration date on the product packaging. Was I wasting hours wearing the trays with the product that may have expired ?&lt;br /&gt;Well, there&#x27;s an expiration date after all, except it&#x27;s not very obvious. I dug up some info on Ultradent&#x27;s website for another product line they have on the convention they use (and I&#x27;m presuming it is consistent across their product lines).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The expiration date is indicated as \\&quot;ZMMY\\&quot;, where Z is a product lot letter, MM is the month and Y is the year. For example, A055 would mean an expiration date of May 2015.&lt;br /&gt;So look closely on your syringe for these characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for those who complained about the lack of instructions, well- they&#x27;re right on Ultradent&#x27;s website (a whole PDF file of instructions, in fact). ultradent.com/en-us/Product Instruction Documents/Opalescence Tooth Whitening.pdf&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In particular, it says-&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Wear Opalescence 10% for 8-10 hours&lt;br /&gt;or overnight, Opalescence 15% for 4-6 hours, Opalescence&lt;br /&gt;20% for 2-4 hours, and Opalescence 35% for 30 minutes.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So keep on smiling with your (hopefully brighter) smiles !</li>
            <li> I am a previous user of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an effective product, I would recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> This product really does whiten my teeth. This is the same product that the dentist use. I really recommend it.</li>
            <li> Hi, thanks to somebody who posted a week ago, we can all solve the mystery of the expiration date of these teeth whitening syringes.  Please see his review and rate him helpful as truly his information is invaluable (dated ~ July 30, 2013).  For those of you not wanting to scroll back, each syringe is incised with a batch number which is a letter followed by three digits.  The three digits are MM/Y where MM is the month of expiration and Y &#x3D; 201Y &#x3D; the year of expiration.  I just received my eight syringes and they were all marked O065 which means the expiration date is in June 2015.  That&#x27;s almost two years off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this tooth whitening system before, provided by my dentist who charged MANY times what you can pay for them on amazon.  Just like pet meds, we should all remember that you CAN shop around, even for prescription items (which these gels are not).  Generally, the dentist or the veterinarian will be the MOST expensive place to find supplies and meds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I know these work.  My dentist made custom trays for me years ago.  I put the teensiest bit in each tooth&#x27;s well - put it in the FRONT of the well, who cares if the back of your teeth are white, no one sees the backs!  Put it in the bottom of each tooth&#x27;s well, as when you squish the tray against your teeth it&#x27;ll tend to squish out toward the edge of your tooth.  Obviously, you want to use enough that the full outer surface of the tooth comes in contact with the gel, but not so much that it squishes all over your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore these overnight and found that my teeth were a little sensitive in the morning but it soon wore off.  These things really DO whiten your teeth!  My teeth tend to be slightly yellow, and that is the type of discoloration that responds best to whitening gels.  I had to have a piece made for a front tooth that I chipped when I was six, so my dentist had me whiten my teeth before having the piece matched - he had to use the whitest shade of porcelain to match my teeth after I whitened them.  So yeah, this stuff works.  And at least in my case, the sensitivity was temporary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this product 5 stars because I know from past use that it works, the batch I received has two years before it expires, and it&#x27;s hella cheap compared to the outrageous price my dentist charged me!</li>
            <li> Worked fast and my teeth are so white! Love it! I do use it with a light for two cycles instead of the suggested overnighy.</li>
            <li> It DOES work. I&#x27;ve been bleaching my teeth for about 7 years. These do just as good as what I got from my orthodontist after I got my braces off. After a while it does turn a bit more stiff though. It works but annoying to spread onto mold.</li>
            <li> White teeth works great. I wear them overnight against directions. Don&#x27;t try the overnight method until you first try it for an hour or so. It is very strong stuff</li>
            <li> Solution seemed weak and did not whiten in the same manner and in the same time period that a previous order of the same strength (from another retailer) did.</li>
            <li> I returned these and the 35% batch I purchased. They don&#x27;t work at all. The ones I get from my dentist, albeit much more expensive, work great. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This product rocks. It leaves my teeth mega white. Be sure to store it in the fridge. For those who cannot find the expiration date on product here is what to do: look on the side of the clear plastic tubing on EACH individual tube.  It is in raised clear letters/numbers and is not obvious, you have to look closely. The format is in ZMYY sequence where Z&#x3D;letter code of batch MM&#x3D;month and Y&#x3D;year.So a code on the side of the tube for example may read BO55 means batch B, expiration date of month 05 (which is May) and year 5 (which is year 2015), So in this example it would expire May 2015. The one I just got reads C116 which translates to batch C, month 11 (which means November) and year 6(meaning 2016) which means it expires Nov. 2016. Hope that helps!</li>
            <li> I thought this was the same strength as that I received from my dentist. Now I&#x27;m not sure. It whitens as well or better but no gums burned white or tooth sensitivity,  I was really surprised because I couldn&#x27;t even finish a week with the other stuff. The only whitening was on my gums where the bleach burned them. I. thought I&#x27;d just tough it out so I was Sooo happily surprised that I didnt have to. Been using for a week now overnight. So probably at least 5 hours a night and I would say my teeth are a good two or three shades lighter already</li>
            <li> this product is easy to use, lightens the teeth and is well priced&lt;br /&gt;i try and use it about twice a year</li>
            <li> Great deal, good stuff! This is the second time I have purchased and will definitely buy again. What more can I say????</li>
            <li> There is no expiration date anywhere on these tubes or the packaging.  I don&#x27;t know what the other reviewers are seeing.  I&#x27;m not happy with these as compared with others I&#x27;ve purchased. There&#x27;s just not as good a result,in fact no result .</li>
            <li> Works very well. It did irritate my gums at first, but after a couple days, it was OK.</li>
            <li> I could&#x27;ve done better buying the crest white strips they work a whole lot better! Waste of money! It don&#x27;t work for me and my teeth just needed to be a little whiter!</li>
            <li> Cheaper then the dentist will sell it  to  you so give  it  a  try this  way... did not  realize  how  many  different strengths there was</li>
            <li> This item really works. It just takes some time getting used to how to apply the product so that it&#x27;s not touching your gums ( which will get irritated and inflamed if product sits on gums).</li>
            <li> They were too strong for my gums. My gums were bleeding. I want to exchange them and go back to the NiteLite, I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> This is not as strong as the 35%, but still effective for brightening your pearly whites. You will love your teeth!</li>
            <li> I have used this bleach for a long time and I am always happy with how white it makes my teeth. Just one bleaching time makes a difference!  I have used higher bleach ratios before and they do whiten my teeth more after first use,but if it gets on your gums it&#x27;s not a good thing.  I have also tried other brands of bleach,but I always come back to the Opalescence.</li>
            <li> the same product at my dentist&#x27;s office was 10x as much! works great, easy to use, too....  l l l</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than buying from my overpriced dentist! This is stronger than what my dentist caries so do not have to leave it on as long (just try not to get it on your gums :))</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other whitening products but they do not compare to this one. It is a great product and the price is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I have only used one of the tubes, and I learned that you can get buy with about 1/3 of a tube each time.  I used the whole thing and had to wipe off about half or more of the gel.  I will know better the next time.  I believe it is as effective as the gel that I buy from my dentist for much more $$.</li>
            <li> I would have to agree with all other bad reviews - this product does not work. It does not have any effect at all.</li>
            <li> Have seen minimal improvement in my teeth.. I use there toothpaste too but have not noticed a difference.. I don&#x27;t think I will be buying again..</li>
            <li> I ordered from this company (they went by Green Dot, but I think they have several names) because it was cheaper than buying from my dentist.  I guess there&#x27;s a reason it was cheaper.  Some of the product seemed to have the same strength as the stuff sold but my dentist, but most of it was weak and did not lighten my teeth.  I&#x27;d say about 10% of what I bought was usable.  When I contacted the company, they first said they&#x27;d replace the order free of charge, but then emailed again saying no, they would not in fact provide a replacement.  Said it had been six months (which it hadn&#x27;t) since my purchase. I looked for their return policy and could not find it.  When I asked for it (and pointed out again that it had not been 6months) they told me (basically) to get lost and they were not going to make good on their original offer, nor stand behind their product. After reading other reviews from customers with similar stories, it seems like this company is trying to pass off bad product for good. Plus, there&#x27;s no phone number so they seem to be hiding behind emails.  Beware.  They don&#x27;t seem honest.  I&#x27;m not sure why Amazon allows this kind of stuff on their site.  I learned my lesson.  I hope you can avoid the same waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I have been using this stuff now for a little over a week.  I bought the 20% and was a little reluctant at first because I do have sensitivity issues with my teeth.  Actually, my dentist recommended the 10% but it was going to take two weeks and I was told I would achieve the best results if I slept with the trays in my mouth over night.  I didn&#x27;t want to go that route and decided I would check out the Opalescence online and the reviews on this product.  Since there are more good reviews than bad, I decided to take a shot and get the 20% because I could wear the trays for 4 hours a day which is a lot better than having to wear them overnight.  I figured I could wear them after supper and I did every night religiously.  I have done 8 applications thus far and see very little change in the color.  Maybe, it lighten my teeth one shade.  My teeth weren&#x27;t heavily stained to begin with and my dentist told me that I would be a great candidate for teeth whitening and that I should see results fast if I followed the directions. Plus, there were no sensitivity issues at all with this product.  Normally, I would think that is good but most of the reviews I read below, some had sensitivity with the 20%.  And so, my theory is this, it lost it&#x27;s potency because it is past the expiration day....(I couldn&#x27;t find one on this product by the way) or it is a fake.  I will continue to use the next 4 syringes because I bought an eight back but I don&#x27;t have high expectations that my teeth will become more whiter.  I really wish I spend the money and had them done professionally.  When something looks like it is too good to be true, it is.  Unless, I see a remarkable change within the next 8 applications, I would never by this product again.</li>
            <li> I normally use a different product but for the price of this one it was affordable and it works great!!</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than buying it from my dentist ! Great product.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, good service, good price.</li>
            <li> I always get a terrific whitening with this 20% Opalescense in about two hours. Using it maybe once a week seems to be sufficient. Been using this brand for years since my former dentist recommended it. Never asked my new dentist about it, because it works for me!</li>
            <li> good. don&#x27;t go stronger as it will irritate.</li>
            <li> My dentist gave me this product, but the cost of refills through his office as way too expensive.  I was glad to see this on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Really works!</li>
            <li> This is not the same product that I get from my dentist.  This products burns and does nothing.</li>
            <li> This product caused me extreme discomfort. It&#x27;s recommended to keep it on overnight, yeah not happening! I couldn&#x27;t keep it on for more than 5 minutes. It caused an ulcer on my gums. Very displeased.</li>
            <li> I purchased the two tubes of teeth whitening and after using the entire eight syringes there was no noticeable difference in the whitening of my teeth.  I have used this product for years but have always gotten it at the dentist office.  Apparently this product was not what was advertised.  DO NOT waste your money.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Perfectly whitens teeth. Fill caps and leave overnight. At one time is half of the syringe. One course enough gel syringe 4. Very very best result.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after already having the trays from my dentist. The strength didn&#x27;t seem to be enough. It took twice as long to get the same results as I had when purchased from dental office. I&#x27;d suggest a higher PF level for quicker results.</li>
            <li> The price and the product both excellent way cheaper then my dentist too Works great and excite to have found it on here</li>
            <li> Im not 100% positive if it is original.</li>
            <li> Great deal as opposed to buying them at the dentist. This gel has a thicker consistency whuch helps my teeth whitening trays fit a bit tighter. The gel stays where you put it. Also I have had less sensitivity with this brand than the Zoom! gel. You do have to use a lot of the tube per tray, but overall I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> Awesome Product Perfect for everyone that wants to get there teeth the whitest. Power Bleaching overnight will do wonders when you wake up</li>
            <li> I bought opalescence 20% because the reviews of the 35% were scary(severe pain,bleached gums etc)The 20% has done nothing to whiten my teeth,I dont know if it is old or what, but I wish  that I had just bought Crest strips from my local store because they are always reliable.</li>
            <li> This product works great even for sensitive teeth (use it everyother day), less expensive then purchasing it directly from my dentist as I have in the past.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Met my expetations.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Easy to use; don&#x27;t really taste the mint flavor.A whitening mouthwash used twice a day regularly may give similar results.</li>
            <li> This is as good as it gets. I pay $20 a tube from my dentist. Out of curiosity I checked Amazon and found the same product for less than half the price. Highly recommend this gel. It brightens and whitens your teeth like no other!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years.  20% is perfect.  I went with 35% once, and burned my gums...right before a job interview to boot.</li>
            <li> This is good for what you get. Basically it comes with just the chemical and a photocopied instruction sheet. But that&#x27;s really all you need. You will need to have your own tray.</li>
            <li> This whitener is much more potent than the normal strips. The only warning that I have is to make sure it does not get on your gums. Seems to whiten quickly but I don&#x27;t use over night. My dentist recommended one hour per day until whiteness level is achieved.</li>
            <li> Package arrived on time as promised and item was exactly as it was initially described.  Packaging was adequate and item arrived undamaged.</li>
            <li> I used this product last year from the dentists office and then recently ordered it for my use.  It is excellent.</li>
            <li> I had ordered the 15% and I needed more whitening so I decided to order 20%. I had a dental appointment last week to have my teeth cleaned and the first thing the hygienist said to me was, &amp;#34;you are the first person to come in today with white teeth.&amp;#34; So, I&#x27;m thrilled with the 20%. I ordered eight refills and I have used four, so I have a new pack when I need to whiten again. I usually whiten my teeth overnight and skip a day in between. It&#x27;s easier on the gums. I haven&#x27;t noticed too much sensitivity, but I have been using Sensodyne toothpaste which really helps.</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of this product since it was first introduced int he market. I recently began making Amazon purchases of this product after the dental industry began to price each syringe of gel as if it were gold. What I notice is that none of the online purchases of this product contain EXPIRATION DATES. The product that is purchased from the dental industry does contain EXPIRATION DATES. In addition, these online gels take longer to whiten and do not burn the gum line like the ones that contain EXPIRATION DATES. I highly suspect that these online purchases of gel are outdated and it takes DOUBLE the time to whiten - therefore, order the 8 pack . After all, I have been doing this for more years than I care to recall and I know the difference.</li>
            <li> 20% hurts the appropriate 15%</li>
            <li> Easy to use, keep refrigerated, cheap and effective and the same as my dentist gave me for far less money.</li>
            <li> I had fairly white teeth before trying this but I am looking for bright white.  So far I&#x27;ve used a little over 1 syringe approximately 6 hours in 3 applications each to both top and bottom. My teeth are absolutely noticeably whiter but not quite bright white, yet.  I am almost certain I will be able to achieve the white I am looking for with this stuff though.  It works great and is less spotty than strips.  I bought 3 moldable trays on amazon for $3 and they work great with this. $33 for opal + $3 trays, If I were to guess I think this will get a lot more use and whitening for the price vs strips.  I certainly like this better than strips as well, the only downside vs strips is you can&#x27;t really go out in public with a whitening tray in your mouth (also unpleasant with strips but with the clear ones you can manage), however I find the tray to be more comfortable than strips, they move around on your teeth, the trays stay put and little to none of it gets in your mouth. With strips I find I&#x27;m constantly moving them and touching them with my tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve did my top 1 hr for the first application, 2 hr the next and then 3 hrs at night, all in the same day.  My teeth gums were super sensitive the following day so I did the bottom the same way that day.  Both top and bottom are whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff does burn (just like strips) if it gets on your gums, The spot between my two front upper teeth got burned pretty severely the 3rd time I applied (I used more than previous applications).  I stuck it out and the burn wore off after 2 or 3 minutes, but it was a pretty intense 2-3 minutes, and 3 days later that little area is still sensitive to touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d certainly recommend these to anyone wishing to whiten their teeth.  Great price and works great.</li>
            <li> Quality product at a fair price</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do! I would take it slow so it doesn&#x27;t burn your gums. Twice a week would be fine</li>
            <li> This product does what it says it will do.  The strength (20%) is less than what I got from my dentist and so it requires longer application time.  For the money that I save it is worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Bought the 20% strength as same price as 10% used before. It works great. There is some minor discomfort with the gum line, but it went after 24 hours. Would recommend this product. Keep it in the fridge when not in use.</li>
            <li> We purchase the teeth whitening from you on a regular basis and find it much cheaper than our dentisit. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery and product as expected</li>
            <li> Originally purchased this product from my dentist and found it very effective for whitening teeth.  Purchasing from this site is much more economical.  Purchase of plastic fitted retainers is necessary for use.</li>
            <li> Not overly impressed with this product.  Not sure it is legit as I haven&#x27;t necessarily noticed much of a difference.</li>
            <li> perfect, exactly what we wanted at a remarkable price</li>
            <li> I think these would work better if they came with instructions.  I looked them up everywhere and didn&#x27;t get the correct amount of time with the first cylinder.  Hopefully I do better with the second one.</li>
            <li> great. My teeths are much whiter now, just after one syringe, and I keep to continue to use it. You do not need to put too much product, as then you can have pain in your teeth. I wash my teeth I dry them, and then I put the product on my finger and directly to my teeth and then I use the silicone teeth case. I wear it usually during the night. Excellent</li>
            <li> This stuff works well without burning the crap out of your gums.  It&#x27;s strong enough to slowly whiten your teeth with no white spots.</li>
            <li> Wow! My teeth are so white!</li>
            <li> We love Opalescence PF because we can use it about every 2 months and continue to have white teeth.  If you drink lots of coffee or tea, which we do, this product will keep your teeth white.</li>
            <li> Much less expensive than local dentist is charging. Works well.</li>
            <li> I have been using Opalescence for almost a year now.  Got the initial product from my dentist that charged an astronomical price.  I then went on-line to see about getting the product for less and much to my surprise I could buy it much, much more reasonable.  A friend noticed my teeth were whiter and she asked about them.  I recommended this product to her but NOT to go to the dentist for it since it is readily available here.  Good stuff!!!</li>
            <li> Much better value than what I can purchase locally. This actually works, but make sure you have trays that are molded to your teeth, otherwise you waste a lot of jel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since I worked for a DMD for many years. I love it and rely on it.</li>
            <li> No big deal. Just like our dentist sells but a fraction of the money. We don&#x27;[t go ultra white like a freak, just a nice healthy white. Great product and minimum to no gum irritation.</li>
            <li> I used to 10% solution from the dentist and wasn&#x27;t quite happy with how long it took to whiten my teeth. I&#x27;ve only used one tube of the 20% and they are super white! It was a bit sensitive after 2 days so I took a 2 day break and then finished the tube without any sensitivity. Use this product! It works well!</li>
            <li> I accidentally ordered 35% originally and learned quickly that it was too strong. With the 20%, I have found it to be easy on my teeth and gums and works perfectly. I keep it on approximately 4-6 hours a day (usually in the evening) with no problem.</li>
            <li> i used the whitening gel twice a month apart following the directions on the package.  My teeth did not show any improvement.  Worst of it is my gum hurt afterward and my teeth became super sensitive.  It was a good thing there&#x27;s no permanent damage on my gum and teeth.  I threw all of it in the trash.</li>
